To accurately portray this character, Alex believes they need to write a scene where the detective encounters a situation that would be highly unsettling to most people, but the detective remains calm and composed.

The scene should be written from a third-person limited perspective, focusing on the detective's experiences and emotions.\n2. The detective should remain calm and composed throughout the scene, with their emotional detachment being a crucial aspect of their character.\n3.
