"in most people with type 2 diabetes , elevation of plasma glucose is the ultimate consequence of failing beta cell function occurring after extended period of waning insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues . however , it has been suggested that circulating metabolites in people with diabetes are ultimately responsible for inducing insulin resistance . thus , several of the circulating factors that are perturbed in people with diabetes such as key metabolites ( glucose , branched chain amino acids , and lipids ) have been shown to impact target tissue glucose uptake . since the initial proposal that abnormal lipid metabolism leads to impaired insulin signaling , the search for underlying mechanistic explanations on cellular and tissue level have been intensified and a growing body of observational as well as mechanistic evidence has been generated demonstrating the important contribution of lipids to obesity induced insulin resistance . deterioration of insulin sensitivity occurs after prolonged ingestions of energy - dense meals in excess of daily caloric requirements thereby introducing a lipotoxic environment in peripheral tissues . in addition acute lipid infusion and consequent increase of lipid excess in non - adipose tissue like muscle is associated with impaired insulin signaling and action . in in obese lipid overloaded individuals it is believed that two elements contribute to the emergence of type 2 diabetes : insulin resistance and lipo - toxicity . the liver and to some extent adipose tissue are viewed as the major contributors of these untoward metabolic perturbations because increased hepatic lipid production and export exceeds the metabolic and storage capacity of peripheral tissues leading to elevated plasma lipid levels . beside the impaired insulin action mentioned above , sustained exposure to high lipid levels is toxic for pancreatic -cell and normalization of plasma lipids halts progressive deterioration of -cell failure . although the knowledge about the deleterious effects and the underlying mechanisms of neutral lipids on whole - body insulin stimulated glucose uptake , -cell function and insulin sensitivity is growing , there is still reason to believe that other lipotoxic factors are involved . over the past decade several investigators have been drawn to study the role of polar sphingolipids as pivotal mediators of lipotoxicity leading to insulin resistance . five common sphingolipids are easily detected in human plasma : ceramides , glucosylceramides , lactosylceramides , sphingomyelin , and ganglioside gm3 
 . in particular some sphingolipids , such as ceramides have been associated with metabolic dysregulation leading to diabetes . admittedly , the current review is rather ceramide centric as most studies have been particularly focused on the negative impact of this class of polar lipids on glycemic control . before considering tissue ceramide accumulation and underlying molecular mechanisms that possibly mediate negative impact of sphingolipids on insulin signaling , it is worth considering the sources of these polar lipids in the human body . spingolipids have an important role as structural components of cellular membranes , ceramides serve also as important bioactive lipids in a variety of cellular processes like cell growth and differentiation , inflammation and apoptosis . every cell in the body has the capacity to de novo synthesize sphingolipids within the endoplasmatic reticulum . also mitochondria seem capable of contributing to sphingolipid metabolism as many of the enzymes involved in ceramide synthesis are also localized in this organelle . four sequential reactions lead to the formation of bioactive ceramide : the first , and rate - limiting step is the conjugation of an amino acid ( typically l - serine ) with the fatty acid palmitoyl - coa catalyzed by the enzyme serine - palmitoyl transferase ( spt ) . the resulting product , sphinganine , is rapidly acylated by ( dihydro)ceramide synthase into dihydroceramide which upon subsequently dehydrogenation catalyzed by dihydroceramide desaturase 1 ( des1 ) gives rise to the key intermediate ceramide . in addition to acylation of the sphinganine as a step in de novo ceramide synthesis , ceramide synthases also catalyze re - acylation of sphingosine as part of a salvage pathway ( figure 1 ) . interestingly , six different but closely related ceramide synthases have been identified , which demonstrate tissue specific expression and variable substrate selectivity thereby providing the basis for tissue specific presence of ceramides with varying acyl chain lengths . for example , ceramide synthase cerc2 is widely expressed and preferentially incorporates c20c24 acyl residues in ceramide , whereas cers3 is predominantly expressed in skin and incorporates very long acyl chains up to c34:0 in the resulting ceramides . ceramide synthase cerc5 seems specifically engaged with c16 ceramide formation , whilst ceramide synthase cerc6 shows a slightly wider substrate selectivity as it is involved in c14 , c16 , and c18 ceramide synthesis . it is important to emphasize that ceramides with different acyl chain length are generated in specific physiological and pathophysiological contexts in a tissue and cell dependent fashion which is like to constitute the basis for differentially influences of signaling pathways   ( figures 24 ) . from the endoplasmatic reticulum , ceramides are transported via a specialized carrier system to the cytosolic leaflet of the trans - golgi apparatus membrane where several metabolic fates await the molecules . thus , in the golgi , ceramide can become glycosylated into glycosylsphingolipids , phosphorylated into ceramide 1-phosphate , or become modified with a polar head turning it into sphingomyelin . further additions of oligosaccharides and sulfate groups give rise to a broad range of very complex glycol and gangliosphingolipids . ceramide is also a source of the bioactive signaling molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate ( s1p ) which upon secretion to the extracellular space acts as a ligand on a family of g - protein coupled receptors , s1p(15 ) . ceramide can also be formed through the salavage pathway which involves the lysosomal degradation of complex sphingolipids into ceramide . the catabolism of the complex glucosphingolipids is predominantly located to the surface of internal membrane vesicles or at endocytosed lipoproteins . receptor mediated endocytosis of low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) delivers the glycosphingolipids to lysosomal lumen . the degradation of the simplest of the complex sphingolipids , glycosylceramide , is catalyzed through the action of glycosylceramide - beta - glucosidase ( gba1 ) . thus , sphingosine is generated in lysosomes from degradation of complex sphingolipids whereby it has the ability to serve as substrate for ceramide re - synthesis . involved key enzymes for this part of the salvage pathway are sphingomyleinases and ceramide synthases . the importance of the salvage pathway is emphasized by the rare but clinically very recognizable glycospingolipidoses characterized by defects in sphingolipid degradation pathways due to mutations of specific acid hydrolases . in the circulatory system , sphingolipids are transported as components of plasma lipoprotein associated particles . thus , ldl particles are the most abundantly loaded with sphingolipids including sphingomyelin and ceramide which is also transported via vldl particles . as mentioned , all tissues are capable of de novo sphingolipid synthesis rendering locally generated sphingolipids a major source of tissue specific accumulation of ceramide . however , as ceramides synthesized in the liver are easily incorporated in ldl and vldl particles , circulating levels of plasma ceramides are most likely of hepatic and to some extent of dietary origin . sphingolipids are also part of the diet   but the daily amounts consumed are relatively modest 0.30.4  g / day and there is no evidence that dietary sphingolipids are essential for healthy growth or even survival . nevertheless , it is likely that individuals consuming foods particularly rich in sphingolipids will clearly exceed this level . sphingolipids undergo considerable hydrolysis in all parts of the small and large intestine , and the resulting sphingosine is rapidly taken up intestinal epithelial cells and degraded in to fatty acids . it is possible that some sphingosine escape degradation in the gut epithelium and access systemic circulation , as radiolabeled sphingoid bases given orally to rats can be found as sphingolipids in the systemic circulation . thus , sphingomyelinase is subject to activation through extracellular signaling pathways which leads to hydrolytic conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide . a well - known activator of neutral sphingomyelinase is the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf ) . this way , oxidative stress induced by tnf enhances sphingomyelin degradation and subsequent ceramide synthesis through the salvage pathway . other components of the innate immune system such as fatty acid activated toll - like receptor activators can trigger ceramide synthesis thereby further enhancing the stimulatory impact of inflammatory cytokines on tissue levels of ceramide and glucosylsphingolipid . increased substrate availability seems to be the primary trigger of increased de novo ceramide synthesis . during conditions of lipid overload , mitochondrial capacity to oxidize fatty acids becomes saturated , and esterified long - chain acyl - coa chains are channeled away from carnitine plamiotyl transferase 1 ( cpt-1 ) . by escaping this cpt-1 mediated entry to mitochondrial -oxidation , long - chain fatty acyl - coa are instead driven towards synthesis of triacylglycerols , and sphingolipids . serine palmitoyltransferase activity is highly dependent on tissue levels of l - serine and palmitate acyl - coa . thus , under circumstances characterized by excess caloric intake ( in the form of palmitate and serine ) , ceramide levels increase in peripheral tissues substantially involved in whole body glucose homeostasis ( such as skeletal muscle , liver , and adipose tissue ) . it has been argued that at least part of the lipotoxic effects of palmitate are due to aberrant synthesis of ceramides because of the selectivity of spt-1 for this fatty acid . this view is supported by clinical observations of human volunteers subjected to intravenous infusion of non - esterified fatty acids demonstrating a very tight correlation between concentrations and time course of rising plasma levels of free fatty acids and ceramides as well as an increased ceramide content in the muscle . more acute regulation of ceramide synthesis is mediated via endocrine regulators of metabolism such as glucocorticoids . the acutely induced impairment of glycemic control by dexamethasone is corroborated by prior inhibition of spt suggesting that increased ceramide levels are downstream mediators of glucocorticoids . this hypothesis is further supported by observations that dexamethasone induces hepatic expression of a number of sphingolipid synthesizing enzymes such as spt2 , gcs1 , and gcs6 . strangely and in contrast to ceramides , glucosylsphingolipid levels are differentially affected in a tissue dependent fashion during high fat feeding , with elevated levels of gm3 in adipose tissue and concomitantly decreased gm3 levels in skeletal muscle . actually , this recent study from the summers laboratory has nuanced our understanding of the putatively deleterious role of glycosylceramides on glucose metabolism in peripheral insulin sensitive tissues . apparently , glycosylceramides impair insulin action in adipocytes whilst in skeletal muscle overexpression of glycosylceramide synthase not only elevates cellular levels of glycosylceramide but also improves insulin action . a variety of diabetic animal models such as leptin signaling deficient db / db mice and zucker diabetic fatty ( zdf ) rats display profound changes in tissue sphingolipid levels . also in non - human primates having developed diabetes due to persistent high - fat feeding , plasma levels of ceramide and dihydroceramide are elevated . interestingly , the rare sphingolipid species , c18:0 deoxysphinganine , which is a marker of increased flux through the serine palmitoyl transferase pathway was also elevated in these diabetic non - human primates suggesting that de novo sphingolipid synthesis could drive the impaired glycemic control in these animals . in people with type 2 diabetes , insulin resistance correlates with plasma levels of ceramide [ 2427 ] , but longitudinal studies confirming causality of rising ceramide levels preceding development of insulin resistance are missing . in a recent study , examining people in various stages of type 2 diabetes , concluded that plasma levels of long - chain gm3 and ceramide are clearly positively correlated to impaired insulin sensitivity . although it is obvious that alterations of plasma ceramide and long - chain gm3 levels constitute early markers of impaired insulin action it is not possible to conclude whether these are causal mediators of insulin resistance or passive bystanders of other underlying mechanisms of dysmetabolic syndrome . however , high - fat fed mice lacking gm3 synthase have both lower plasma glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity compared to high - fat fed wild type mice . this observation suggest that complex sphingolipids are also interfering with insulin action , although the lack of metabolomic profiling of the gm3 synthase null mice makes it difficult to address which sphingolipid species in particular could mediate these untoward effects . carefully conducted clinical studies scrutinizing the correlation between plasma and tissue levels of sphingolipids are rare and mostly of quite limited size [ 24,2931 ] . high quality quantitative analytical methodologies have not been widely available for classification of tissue and plasma sphingolipids , which has made comparison of different reports difficult . most clinical trials reporting plasma levels of sphingolipids have measured total ceramides accompanied by a limited subfractionation . with recent methodological advancements it has been possible to analyze specific molecular sphingolipid subspecies in a quantitative fashion and with reasonable throughput . using high - specificity quantitative methods , it has it seems evident that plasma levels of longer chain ceramides ( > 16 ) and ganglioside gm3 ( > 18 ) are associated with impaired insulin sensitivity . however , far more studies are needed to conclusively confirm which of the many sphingolipid species detectable in plasma are the most reliable surrogate markers of metabolic disease . further , a number of studies have found increased intramyocellular levels of ceramides in skeletal muscle biopsies from obese insulin resistant human volunteers . however , not all clinical observations confirm a connection between muscle ceramides and insulin resistance , as improvement of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity through endurance training seemingly have no impact on intramyocellular ceramide content in young males . more recently a correlation between homa - ir and total ceramide as well as ceramide c16:0 in subcutaneous and epicardial adipose tissue could be established , which suggest that the bioactive lipid content in this tissue might be more predictive for insulin resistance . furthermore increased ceramide content in this tissue interestingly , dramatic decrease in body adiposity and improvement of insulin sensitivity as obtained in obese subjects after bariatric surgery is accompanied by reduction of plasma c16:0 and c24:0 ceramides in particular . numerous in vitro experiments have consistently demonstrated that increased exposure to ceramide and glucosphingolipids impair functional activity of several of the molecular components of the insulin signaling pathway . the primary target of ceramides in the insulin signaling pathway is protein kinase b ( pkb)/akt . two distinct underlying molecular mechanisms appear to be involved in ceramide induced impairment of pkb / akt activity . ceramide interferes with both a kinase and a phosphatase required for insulin mediated activation of pkb / akt : firstly , ceramide activates cytosolic protein phosphatase-2a ( pp2a ) which is a serine / threonine phosphatase responsible for pkb / akt dephosphorylation . dephosphorylation of thr and/or ser in pkb / akt leaves it inactivated whereby translocation to the plasma membrane does not occur . secondly , upon accrual of ceramide in the outer layer of the cell membrane it accumulates in the caveolin - enriched domains . in this location , ceramide interferes with pkczeta catalyzed phosphorylation of pkb / akt thr whereby pkb / akt sequesters in a repressed state preventing downstream insulin receptor signaling . a third albeit lesser validated mechanism via which ceramide inhibits glucose transport has to do with ceramide enriched microdomains in phosphatidylcholine containing membranes . due to altered membrane fluidity ceramides interferes with glut4 translocation and fusion to the cell membrane . it has also been proposed that ceramide inhibits the expression of glut4 in 3t3-l1 adipocytes which would synergize aforementioned effects on glut4 translocation . for glycosphigolipids the interaction of gm3 seems to be mediated by a specific lysine residue in the transmembrane domain of the receptor and excess levels of this ganglioside promote the dissociation of the ir from the caveolae hence hindering signal transduction . consistent with this theory mice lacking gm3 have been reported to show enhanced phosphorylation of the ir . thus it has been demonstrated that elevation of intracellular levels of very - long chain - ceramides ( > 24 ) through increased cers2 activity promotes proliferation whilst increase in long - chain - ceramides ( c16:0 and c18:0 ) promotes apoptosis . further , the ratio between very - long - chain ceramides and long - chain - ceramides influences autophagy in a variety of pathophysiological settings . unfortunately , studies scrutinizing the importance of specific ceramide chain lengths on insulin signaling and glucose uptake are lacking . however , it has been shown that aforementioned ceramide induced activation of pp2a is particularly mediated via c16:0 ceramide suggesting that elevated cers5 and/or cers6 activity could be linked to impaired insulin action . recently , another very interesting link between ceramide and insulin action was discovered . through a thorough series of experiments , holland and colleagues demonstrated that adipocyte derived adiponectin imposes its beneficial effects on insulin signaling through effects on sphingolipid metabolism . apparently , both adiponectin receptors , adipor1 and adipor2 possess intrinsic ceramidase activity which upon receptor activation promotes degradation of intracellular ceramide species to sphingosine-1-phosphate ( s1p ) . however , it can not be excluded the adiponectin induced s1p formation is also the result of adipor1/adipor2 mediated activation of other ceramidases . irrespective of the synthesis pathway , holland et al . further demonstrated that adiponectin induced s1p formation is required as an important messenger between adipor1/adipor2 and ampk activation . the similar beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity are also obtained when acid ceramidase is overexpressed in free fatty acid overexposed myotubes . whereas the negative impact of ceramide upon insulin signaling affects all studied insulin receptor expressing tissues , a recent study has demonstrated that interference of glucosylceramide with insulin signaling predominantly affects adipose tissue whereas myotubes are unaffected by this sphingolipid . however , the cellular mechanisms have largely been studied using cell systems , and future studies are required to translate these in vitro findings to in vivo models of insulin resistance and humans . given the evidence that alterations of cellular sphingolipid levels alters insulin action it has been speculated whether therapeutic interventions modifying synthesis and tissue distribution of ceramides and/or complex sphingolipids will improve whole body glucose homeostasis . unfortunately , studies bridging in vitro observations of deleterious effects of ceramide and gm3 on insulin signaling to conclusive evidence of ceramide induced impairment of whole body glucose homeostasis are not entirely conclusive . so far , clinical phenotypes with impaired insulin action and/or overt diabetes have not been convincingly associated with genetic variations of enzymes involved in sphingolipid synthesis pathways . however , this may simply be due to the fact that people suffering from serious sphingolipidoses exert rather severe phenotypes primarily characterized by neurological complications and early fatality rendering potential metabolic disorders undetected . with the absence of human genetic data it remains to be proven that transgenic animal models carrying gain or loss of function mutations of sphingolipid synthesis enzymes have any translational validity . mice carrying a tissue wide deletion of gm3 synthase have improved insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle compared to wild type animals and display a clear resistance against diet - induced impaired insulin function . apparently , the absence of gm3 synthase has no deleterious effects on vital functions . in contrast , mice lacking other sphingolipid synthesis enzymes have overt phenotypes rendering interpretation of the metabolic consequences of the absence of these specific enzymes difficult . genetic ablation of dihydroceramide desaturase 1 ( des1 ) affects the animals ability to form ceramide . animals lacking both alleles encoding des1 are growth retarded and display increased mortality due to a complex phenotype with hepatomegaly , scaly skin , and practically no hair probably resulting a loss of core temperature and impaired liver function . however , heterozygous des1mice are characterized by markedly lower ceramide levels in peripheral tissues with concomitant significant improvements of insulin sensitivity and insensitivity to glucocorticoid induced metabolic impairment . dependent on substrate acyl chain length one of several ceramide synthases is involved in adding a second acyl chain to sphinganine to form dihydroceramide . genetic ablation of ceramide synthase 1 , which primarily catalyzes c18:0 acylation leads to a severe cerebellar purkinje cell loss and accompanying ataxia . complete deletion of ceramide synthase 2 leads to cerebral depletion of myelin sheet formation , cerebellar degeneration and increased prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma . genetic ablation of ceramide synthase 6 in mice leads to behavioral abnormalities indicating a vital role of c16:0 sphingolipids in central nervous system function . another more profound phenotype is seen in mice carrying a tissue selective deletion of glucosylceramide synthase ( gcs ) in the epithelial cells of the intestine . newborn mice with a villin promoter driven gcs knock - out die soon after birth due to grossly impaired ability to absorb nutrients from intestine . also adult mice carrying an inducible deletion of the gcs gene in intestinal epithelial cells die shortly after activating the deletion . the malabsorption is caused by grossly impaired ability to form intracellular vesicles trafficking lipids from the apical plasma membrane of the enterocyte to intracellular lipid depots . obviously , it is impossible to deduct which of the complex glycosphingolipids being formed down - stream of the gcs catalyzed step are required for normal intestinal absorption of lipids , but given the seemingly normal phenotype of gm3 synthase knock - out mice , it seems evident that sphingolipids formed upstream of gm3 synthase are involved . presence of elevated ceramide levels in plasma as well as tissues of importance for glucose metabolism such as liver , skeletal , muscle , and adipose tissue does not necessarily confirm causality between ceramide exposure and deterioration of insulin signaling . for example , it is well recognized that plasma levels of triglycerides correlate positively as a surrogate marker of insulin resistance whereas data demonstrating that aggressive triglyceride lowering therapy with fibrates and niacin are incapable of improving glycemic control . although several studies have demonstrated that increased ceramide exposure deteriorate insulin signaling in vitro , it was only recently that in vivo evidence linking plasma levels of ceramides to insulin sensitivity became available . due to their lipophilic nature however , when using ldl particles as carriers of ceramides it has been possible to elevate plasma ceramide levels to patophysiologically relevant levels in mice with concomitant deterioration of whole body glucose handling due to increased insulin resistance . interestingly , boon et al . demonstrated that intraveneous ldl  ceramide infusions increase ceramide content in skeletal muscle cell membranes but not in any other examined tissues . thus , it seems evident that increased plasma levels of ceramide impair glycemic control , but clear cut evidence from in vivo experimentation demonstrating that therapeutic improvement of insulin sensitivity is causally linked to lowering of plasma ceramide levels is still missing . till this moment , there is no publicly available information about clinical experience with specific inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesizing enzymes in diabetes patients . however , the glycosylceramide synthase ( gcs ) inhibitor , eliglustat , is currently undergoing late phase clinical development targeting patients with gauchers disease as the inhibition of gcs reduces the substrate load into the glycosphingolipid synthesis pathway . patients with gauchers disease are characterized by an inborn error of the enzyme glycosylceramide - beta - glucosidase ( gba1 ) , which leads to accumulation of glucocerebroside within lysosomes of macrophages . some patients with this disease show a markedly increased hepatic glucose production , elevated insulin levels and reduced insulin mediated whole body glucose uptake as demonstrated in euglycemic clamp experiments , which might be the result of the increased production of gangliosides like gm3 . however following enzyme replacement therapy some patients gain body weight and develop diabetes , which might be the result of the loss of glucose - consuming macrophages . therefore it is impossible to extrapolate effects of gcs inhibition on glycemic control from these clinical trials , and only rigorous assessment of the gcs inhibitors in adequate patient populations can tell if inhibition of glycosylceramide production will translate into clinical benefits for people with diabetes . a wide variety of experimental molecules have been tested in cellular in vitro systems as well as in preclinical in vivo models . although it is likely that myriocin has other molecular targets , it has been widely used as a tool compound to inhibit spt1 activity in a variety of animal models . thus , myriocin treatment significantly improves glycemic control in both obese and overtly diabetic rodent models . oral administration of myriocin is associated with moderate weight loss , but as parenteral administration of myriocin does not affect body weight it is reasonable to assume that improved glycemia is not simply the result of negative energy balance . formal assessment of myriocins chronic effects on whole body energy balance has yet to be conducted but chronic dosing of myriocin ( 0.30.5  mg / kg / day ) to zdf rats significantly improve metabolic control in parallel with dramatic reduction of skeletal muscle and plasma ceramide . in addition to eliglustat , other inhibitors of gcs are available and some of these have been tested in animal models of diabetes . small molecule compounds like fumonisin b1 and the imonosugar n-(5'-adamantine-1'-yl - methoxy)-pentyl-1-deoxynojirimycin ( amp - dnm ) have been used in chronic in vivo studies to demonstrate that pharmacologically induced depletion of glycosphingolipids is associated with improved insulin sensitivity in mice . in addition to improved glycemia , ob / ob mice treated with amp - dnm also display improved hepatic lipid deposition , amelioration of cirrhosis markers , and reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis . the data obtained with amp - dnm should be interpreted with caution as this molecule also infers inhibition of the intestinal enzyme sucrose - isomaltase whereby intestinal carbohydrate absorption is likely to be hampered . however , the far more specific inhibitor of gcs , genz-123346 , also concomitantly reduces formation of glucosphingolipids and improves insulin sensitivity and corrects hepatosteatosis . given it becomes possible to decipher which of the ceramide species exert most deleterious effects on glucose homeostasis it may be possible an interesting therapeutic approach could be to target specific cers16 isoforms rather than spt1 . such approach would potentially provide selective reduction of the unwanted ceramides whilst leaving others unaffected . further addressing specific ceramide synthases presence of elevated ceramide levels in plasma as well as tissues of importance for glucose metabolism such as liver , skeletal , muscle , and adipose tissue does not necessarily confirm causality between ceramide exposure and deterioration of insulin signaling . for example , it is well recognized that plasma levels of triglycerides correlate positively as a surrogate marker of insulin resistance whereas data demonstrating that aggressive triglyceride lowering therapy with fibrates and niacin are incapable of improving glycemic control . although several studies have demonstrated that increased ceramide exposure deteriorate insulin signaling in vitro , it was only recently that in vivo evidence linking plasma levels of ceramides to insulin sensitivity became available . due to their lipophilic nature however , when using ldl particles as carriers of ceramides it has been possible to elevate plasma ceramide levels to patophysiologically relevant levels in mice with concomitant deterioration of whole body glucose handling due to increased insulin resistance . interestingly , boon et al . demonstrated that intraveneous ldl  ceramide infusions increase ceramide content in skeletal muscle cell membranes but not in any other examined tissues . thus , it seems evident that increased plasma levels of ceramide impair glycemic control , but clear cut evidence from in vivo experimentation demonstrating that therapeutic improvement of insulin sensitivity is causally linked to lowering of plasma ceramide levels is still missing . till this moment , there is no publicly available information about clinical experience with specific inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesizing enzymes in diabetes patients . however , the glycosylceramide synthase ( gcs ) inhibitor , eliglustat , is currently undergoing late phase clinical development targeting patients with gauchers disease as the inhibition of gcs reduces the substrate load into the glycosphingolipid synthesis pathway . patients with gauchers disease are characterized by an inborn error of the enzyme glycosylceramide -

 ceramides accumulate in insulin sensitive tissues either as a consequence of de novo synthesis or through mobilization from complex sphingolipids . 
 clinical studies have confirmed positive correlation between plasma and tissue levels of several ceramide species and insulin resistance . at the cellular level , it has been demonstrated that ceramides impair insulin signaling and intracellular handling of glucose and lipids with resulting deleterious effects on cellular metabolism . 
 hence , we are reviewing whether therapeutic interventions aiming at reducing tissue exposure to ceramides or other sphingolipids represent viable therapeutic approaches to improve glucose metabolism in people with diabetes .",195
"experimental animals : male c57bl/6ncrslc mice ( 8 weeks old ) were purchased 
 from japan slc ( hamamatsu , japan ) . all mice were maintained in 40.5  20.5  18.5 cm 
 individual ventilated cages ( sealsafe plus mouse ; tecniplast , buguggiate , italy ) under 
 controlled temperature ( 23  2c ) and humidity ( 50  10% ) on a 12-hr light / dark cycle at the 
 kobe university life - science laboratory with ad libitum access to a pellet 
 diet ( dc-8 ; clea japan , tokyo , japan ) and filtered water . this study was approved by the 
 institutional animal care and use committee ( permission # 24 - 10 - 03 ) and carried out according 
 to the kobe university animal experimental regulation . ctd purification and hplc analysis : water - soluble dantotsu 
 ( involving 16% of ctd ; sumitomo chemical co. , tokyo , japan ) , donated by sado city ( niigata , 
 japan ) , was washed with 10 times the amount of distilled water to remove the surfactant 
 activating and granulating agents . after being left to stand for at least 48 hr , this step was repeated five times , and then , the white precipitate 
 was collected and air - dried naturally for a week . the content rate of ctd in the white 
 precipitate was measured by a lachrom high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) system 
 ( interface l-7000 , pump l-7100 , auto sampler l-7200 , column oven l-7350 and uv - vis detector 
 l-7420 ; hitachi , tokyo , japan ) using a capcell pak c18 ug120 column ( 5 m 
 particles , 4.6  250 mm ; shiseido , tokyo , japan ) . ctd standard ( > 99.8% ; wako chemical , osaka , japan ) and the obtained white powder were 
 completely dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) and then serial - diluted with a mobile 
 phase consisting of 55% acetonitrile in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 3.0 ) , followed 
 by filtration with a 0.20 m syringe driven filter unit ( millex - lg ; 
 millipore , billerica , ma , u.s.a . ) . the column maintained at 40c was eluted with the mobile 
 phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml / min . after the column was equilibrated , 10 
 l of the samples was injected into the hplc system . we monitored the 
 resultant chromatograph at the wavelength of 260 nm and then calculated the ctd content of 
 the obtained white powder from the calibration curve created by the peak areas and heights 
 of the ctd standard . a single peak was observed in the samples from the white precipitate 
 with the same retention time as that of the ctd standard . a linear calibration curve 
 ( r=0.999 ) created from samples serial - diluted with the ctd standard showed 
 that our purification makes the content rate of ctd increased from 1416% to 9397% by 
 weight . ctd administration and stress exposure : all mice were allowed to acclimate 
 to their home cages for a week prior to the initiation of experiments . we divided the mice 
 into eight groups ( n=5 mice in each cage ) : ctd-0 ( control ) , ctd-10 ( 10 mg / kg / day ) , ctd-50 
 ( 50 mg / kg / day ) and ctd-250 ( 250 mg / kg / day ) with the presence or absence of stress exposure . 
 as a substitute for filtered water for the mice , we used the medigel sucrarose 2 
 oz cup ( clearh2o , portland , me , u.s.a . ) , which is a flavored thermoreversible 
 hydration gel matrix . the amounts of the purified ctd for the respective administration 
 groups were calculated from the ctd purity ( 95% ) , daily gel intake ( 5 g / day / mouse ) , total 
 gel weight ( 60 g ; excluding the package weight ) and average mouse weight ( 24 g ; weighed at 
 initiation of experiments ) . these amounts of ctd were completely dissolved in 600 
 l dmso ( 1% volume of a gel ) and injected into the gels and then 
 double - boiled at 60c followed by shaking to ensure that the ctd was diffused well . for the 
 ctd-0 group , the same volume of dmso without the purified ctd all gels were strapped with cable ties under the grate of the cage lid to prevent 
 contamination with the beddings and the excretions . all gels were weighed daily to estimate 
 the amounts of the putative ctd exposure . in the four stress groups , the mice were subjected 
 to an unpredictable chronic stress procedure as described in our earlier report   with some modifications . briefly , the following six 
 stressors were used : 5 min forced swimming in water at room temperature ( rt ) , 24 hr food and 
 water deprivation , continuous overnight illumination , 30 min horizontal cage shaking ( 80 
 rpm ) , 24 hr switching of cagemates ( being housed with another mouse ) and 24 hr wet bedding . 
 to maximize the unpredictability of this paradigm , the mice were randomly exposed to two 
 mild stressors per day at varying times for 4 weeks . behavioral analysis : on the last day of the 4 week experimental period , an 
 open field test was conducted during the light phase to evaluate the locomotor activity and 
 the anxiety - like behavior of the mice . briefly , the mouse was placed on the corner of an

 recorded by a video camera for the subsequent 10 min , and we then analyzed the total 
 distance traveled and the time spent in the center zone ( 30  30 cm ) using smart video 
 tracking software v3.0 ( san diego instruments , san diego , ca , u.s.a . ) . tissue preparation : on the day after the completion of the 4 weeks of 
 combined exposure to ctd and stress , all mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether 
 and transcardially perfused with 0.9% normal saline , followed by perfusion with ice - cold 4% 
 paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer . the testes were excised , weighed and postfixed with 
 the same fixative overnight at 4c . the testes were dehydrated through a graded series of 
 ethanol followed by xylene and embedded in paraffin . serial sections of testes were then cut 
 at 4 m thickness on a sliding microtome ( sm2000r ; leica microsystems , 
 wetzlar , germany ) and mounted on slide glasses ( platinum pro ; matsunami glass ind . histological and immunohistochemical analyses : for the general 
 histological analysis , testis sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( he ; merck

 immunoglobulins conjugated to peroxidase - labeled dextran polymer in tris ( hydroxymethyl ) 
 aminomethane - hcl buffer ( envision+ ; dako , glostrup , denmark ) for 1 hr at rt . immunoreactivity was then detected by incubation with 3,3-diaminobenzidine solution 
 ( envision+ kit / hrp[dab ] , dako ) . the sections were then rinsed with distilled water and 
 counterstained lightly with hematoxylin solution for 1 min . next , the sections were placed

 significantly inhibited the times spent in the center zone in the ctd-250 groups

 stress procedure was observed between the ctd-0 groups . in the non - stressed condition , there were significant differences in the ctd-10 and ctd-50 groups compared to the 
 ctd-0 group . histological and immunohistochemical findings : the general histological 
 analyses of the testes by he staining are shown in fig the 
 seminiferous tubules of the control group showed robust spermatogenesis with densely 
 stacked germ cells . multinucleated giant cells ( arrow ) were occasionally observed in 
 the testes of the ctd-0+stress groups . in the ctd groups , dose - dependent vacuoled 
 degeneration ( arrowhead ) of seminiferous tubules was observed . degenerated 
 seminiferous tubules only composed of sertoli cells were present in the ctd-250 
 groups . bar=100 m .. although there were seminiferous tubules densely arranged with germ cells and sperms 
 in the testes of the control group , several testicular signs of toxicity were observed in 
 combined exposure groups . multinucleated giant cells were occasionally observed in the 
 seminiferous tubules of the mice in the stress groups . in addition , variably sized 
 vacuolizations were scattered at the bottom of seminiferous tubules of the ctd - administered 
 groups . in particular , seriously degenerated seminiferous tubules , from which almost all 
 germ cells had dropped off , were found in the ctd-250 groups . there was no marked 
 histological difference between the leydig cells in the testicular interstitial tissues of 
 any of the experimental groups . the 
 seminiferous tubules of the control group showed robust spermatogenesis with densely 
 stacked germ cells . multinucleated giant cells ( arrow ) were occasionally observed in 
 the testes of the ctd-0+stress groups . in the ctd groups , dose - dependent vacuoled 
 degeneration ( arrowhead ) of seminiferous tubules was observed . degenerated 
 seminiferous tubules only composed of sertoli cells were present in the ctd-250 
 groups . bar=100 m . the results of the immunohistochemical analyses of the testes visualizing gpx4 are shown in 
 fig . 4.representative immunohistochemistry for gpx4 of the testis in the non - stressed and 
 stressed groups . gpx4 immunoreactivities were detected in sperms and spermatids in the 
 testes of the control group . in the testes of the stressed groups , reduced 
 immunoreactivity of gpx4 in sperm was observed . in the ctd groups , spermatids showed 
 weakened immunoreactivity of gpx4 . sertoli cells ectopically expressed gpx4 in 
 degenerated seminiferous tubules of the ctd-50+stress group and the ctd-250 groups . bar=100 m .. in the control group , strong gpx4 immunoreactivity was detected in the sperm , and 
 diffuse gpx4 immunoreactivity was seen in the cytoplasm of spermatids . the intensity of gpx4 
 immunoreactivity in the sperm was decreased by stress , and the cytoplasmic immunoreactivity 
 in the spermatids was dose - dependently decreased by ctd . in addition , abnormal 
 immunoreactivity of gpx4 in sertoli cells was detected in the combined exposure groups , and 
 it became strong in degenerated seminiferous tubules in the ctd-50+stress group and the 
 ctd-250 groups . representative immunohistochemistry for gpx4 of the testis in the non - stressed and 
 stressed groups . gpx4 immunoreactivities were detected in sperms and spermatids in the 
 testes of the control group . in the testes of the stressed groups , reduced 
 immunoreactivity of gpx4 in sperm was observed . in the ctd groups sertoli cells ectopically expressed gpx4 in 
 degenerated seminiferous tubules of the ctd-50+stress group and the ctd-250 groups . we verified the combined effects of ctd and stress on the reproductive and behavioral 
 function in mature male mice by a non - invasive administration method . there are several 
 advantages of the gels we used ; compared to baking pellets , the gels can uniformly deliver 
 the test articles to animals without exposing them to high temperature . the gels could not 
 completely cloak the bad palatability of ctd as reported earlier using similar gels mixed 
 with an aromatase inhibitor , anastrozole ; 
 however , the gel consumption observed in combined exposure groups was enough for maintaining 
 the health of the mice . in our preliminary experiments , we initially suspected that the ctd 
 avoidance effect was attributable to any accessory constituents of the commercial pesticide 
 containing ctd , but ctd itself appeared to have some repellent effects on mice . in 
 agricultural fields , ctd - containing pesticides are used at dilutions from 1:20 to 1:4,000 
 for treating seeds and plants . our purification protocol and the water solubility of ctd 
 imply that the white precipitate resulting from the recommended concentration of ctd 
 products is particularly dangerous for pesticide users . in the present study , the unpredictable stress model , which is often used in the assessment 
 of antidepressant medications , evidently raised the anxiety level in the mice . ctd 
 dose - dependently induced anxiety alone , but there was little difference in this measure 
 among the combined exposure groups . to the best of our knowledge , there are only a few reports about the behavioral effects of neonicotinoids on mammals . several parameters of behavioral developmental tests that evaluated the sense of 
 equilibrium , coordinated movement and muscular power of offspring were changed by maternal 
 exposure to low - dose ctd , with a sex difference [ 34 , 
 35 ] . thiamethoxam ( tmx , 100 mg / kg / day ) 
 significantly reduced the locomotor activity of rats in an open field test and induced 
 anxiety in an elevated plus - maze test while suppressing acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) activity 
 in three brain regions . considering that tmx is 
 metabolized to ctd in mammals , our findings regarding the anxiogenic effects of ctd 
 sufficiently agree with the findings of these prior studies . although the mechanisms of the behavioral effects of neonicotinoids remain unclear , 
 cholinergic systems and downstream neurotransmitters are undoubtedly involved . an in 
 vivo study revealed that ctd directly injected into the rat brain evoked a 
 striatal dopamine surge through nachrs . early 
 types of neonicotinoids caused a subsequent desensitization of nachrs as well as immediate 
 neuronal excitation . the behavioral consequences 
 of chronic nicotine intake are also attributed to both the upregulation and desensitization 
 of nachrs . the anxiety - like behaviors in several 
 behavioral tests are part of the phenotype of nachrs subunit 4 knockout mice , implying that the anxiogenic effect of ctd observed 
 in the present study was presumably triggered by the chronic desensitization of nachrs . the chrna7 coding 7 subunit of nachrs contains a glucocorticoid response 
 element , which may explain the decreasing nachrs 
 7 expression by chronic immobilization stress . these observations may support the hypothesis that the behavioral effects of ctd and stress 
 partly share a common mechanism mediating weakened cholinergic activities , such as the 
 desensitization of nachrs , the suppressed level of ache and the disturbance of the release 
 of downstream neurotransmitters . in the ctd-250+stress groups , the stress procedure and the 
 ctd - induced feeding suppression presumably fully suppressed the cholinergic activities , 
 which made the anxiogenic effect of ctd invisible . on the other hand , we found that the chronic exposure to ctd and the stress influenced the 
 testes in different ways . the stress procedure significantly decreased the testicular weight 
 in addition to causing the emergence of the multinucleated giant cells , and both of these 
 are common toxicant observations in testes produced by an abnormal meiotic division of germ 
 cells . ctd did not show an impact on the testicular weight , whereas it dose - dependently 
 degenerated the seminiferous epithelia . in particular , the sertoli cell - only seminiferous 
 tubules found in the ctd-250 groups were unexplainable by ctd - induced chronic nutritional 
 deprivation . in the clinical field , sertoli cell - only syndrome is known to result from 
 partial deletions of the azoospermia factor region on the y - chromosome , which is one of the 
 markers of male infertility . from the toxicological perspective , germ cells are vulnerable 
 to damage from exogenous chemicals , and they are easily phagocytized by sertoli cells . several endocrine - disrupting compounds ( edcs ) including diethylstilbestrol and flutamide 
 induce such a destruction of seminiferous tubules [ 1 , 
 11 , 40 ] . an 
 increasing number of vacuolizations in seminiferous epithelia are also caused by the absence 
 of germ cells , suggesting that they are the first target of ctd in the testes through the 
 blood - testis barrier . this corresponds to the ctd dose - dependent increase of single - stranded 
 dna immunopositive germ cells observed in the testes of quails [ 15 , 36 ] . gpx4 ( also called phospholipid - hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase as a member of the 
 glutathione peroxidase family ) is an antioxidant enzyme expressed in every mammalian organ . 
 there are three types of transcripts from the same gpx4 gene : 
 mitochondrial , non - mitochondrial and nuclear types were identified . the mitochondrial and 
 non - mitochondrial types in particular are expressed in spermatocytes , and gpx4 is the 
 principal antioxidant enzymes in the testes with 30 times greater expression in the testes 
 compared to other organs . notably , in sperm , gpx4 is responsible for the abilities to 
 scavenge approx . testis - specific gpx4 knockout mice showed a phenotype of infertility with degenerated 
 testicular tissue and morphological aberration of sperm . the antigen of the polyclonal antibody used in this study is a common 
 sequence among the three types of mouse gpx4 , and thus , we could not classify the types of 
 gpx4 immunoreactivity . the weakened gpx4 immunoreactivity in the lumen of seminiferous 
 tubules presumably resulted from the decreases in the number and quality of the sperm . neonicotinoids are known to have strong oxidizing properties that affect the liver and the 
 reproductive and central nervous systems [ 7 , 19 ] . the present report is the first to describe the 
 localized decrease of antioxidant enzymes by ctd in the testes of a mammal . similarly , 
 oxidative effects of psychological stress via stress hormones have been reported [ 23 , 42 ] . although 
 a constant level of reactive oxygen species is necessary for the proliferation of 
 spermatogonial stem cells , the present results 
 also showed that oxidative mechanisms partly explain how stress impacts the reproductive 
 function cooperatively with ctd . although there are no reports of plentiful expressions of gpx4 in sertoli cells , strong 
 ectopic expression of antioxidant enzymes was observed in sertoli cells in degenerated 
 seminiferous tubules in the ctd-250 groups . because gpx4 mrna was not expressed in sertoli 
 cell in rat , investigated whether gpx4 mrna in the testes was 
 altered by several edcs , implying the measurements of oxidative conditions provide an 
 indication of the testicular toxicity by environmental factors . in the present study , although no remarkable interaction effect was detected , we 
 investigated whether ctd and stress affected the behavioral and reproductive functions 
 additively rather than synergistically in adult mice . the endogenous nachrs agonist lynx1 
 was recently reported to serve as a molecular break system for brain plasticity . the developmental effects of neonicotinoids in 
 juvenile and fetal periods remain to be determined . neonicotinoids and their metabolites are 
 detected at high frequency in urine samples from japanese people . human exposure to ctd at a high concentration as high as that of the 
 present ctd-250 groups does not occur naturally , but the precipitates that result from the 
 low water solubility of ctd are very dangerous . in addition , a low concentration of ctd 
 could become harmful under a stressed condition , such as fasting . the finding that one of the metabolites of imidacloprid ( imi ) seriously disturbs mapk / erk 
 signaling compared to imi itself   suggests that 
 the safety coefficient ( 100 ) for calculating the acceptable daily intake is not 
 satisfactory . taking the results of the present study as an example , it is clear that 
 further research is needed to identify the toxicant mechanisms of environmental chemicals in 
 order to protect humans and animals with high sensitivities under stressed conditions .","neonicotinoids , some of the most widely used pesticides in the world , act as agonists to 
 the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nachrs ) of insects , resulting in death from 
 abnormal excitability . 
 neonicotinoids unexpectedly became a major topic as a compelling 
 cause of honeybee colony collapse disorder , which is damaging crop production that 
 requires pollination worldwide . 
 mammal nachrs appear to have a certain affinity for 
 neonicotinoids with lower levels than those of insects ; there is thus rising concern about 
 unpredictable adverse effects of neonicotinoids on vertebrates . 
 we hypothesized that the 
 effects of neonicotinoids would be enhanced under a chronic stressed condition , which is 
 known to alter the expression of targets of neonicotinoids , i.e. , 
 neuronal nachrs . 
 we performed immunohistochemical and behavioral analyses in male mice 
 actively administered a neonicotinoid , clothianidin ( ctd ; 0 , 10 , 50 and 250 mg / kg / day ) , 
 for 4 weeks under an unpredictable chronic stress procedure . vacuolated seminiferous 
 epithelia and a decrease in the immunoreactivity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione 
 peroxidase 4 were observed in the testes of the ctd+stress mice . in an open field test , 
 although the locomotor activities were not affected , the anxiety - like behaviors of the 
 mice were elevated by both ctd and stress . 
 the present study demonstrates that the 
 behavioral and reproductive effects of ctd become more serious in combination with 
 environmental stress , which may reflect our actual situation of multiple exposure .",350
"granuloma annulare ( ga ) was first described in 1895 by colcott - fox who reported an 11-year - old girl with a  ring eruption of the fingers . the condition is a benign , usually self - limited granulomatous disease of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue . clinically , the condition is characterized by asymptomatic , flesh - colored or erythematous - brown papules , frequently arranged in a ring or annular pattern on the distal extremities . it may be skin - colored erythematous or violaceous measuring 1 - 5 cm in diameter . several clinical variants of ga have been reported , namely localized , generalized or disseminated , targetoid , giant , subcutaneous and perforating ga . we report an 18-month - old male child with multiple , progressive ga over the lower extremities . an 18-month - old male child presented with multiple annular lesions over lower extremities and buttocks . initially it started as a small papule over the left thigh , substantially attaining the present size . there was no history of fever , pain , drug intake or recent vaccination . on examination , on cutaneous examination , closely set , skin - colored , firm , smooth papules 2 - 3 mm in size arranged in a ring - like fashion to form annular plaques measuring approximately 3  3 cm ( eight lesions ) were present over dorsal aspect of foot [ figures 1 and 2 ] , both legs and buttocks . granuloma annulare over the left foot granuloma annulare over the right ankle routine hematological , biochemical and urine examinations were normal . venereal disease research laboratory test , human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 , hepatitis surface antigen test were negative and a biopsy showed features consistent with ga . ga is a benign , relatively common cutaneous disease that classically presents as closely set , skin - colored , firm , smooth papules 2 - 3 mm in size arranged in a ring - like fashion to form annular lesions . most cases occur before the age of 30 years and it is approximately twice more common in females . it often favors sacral sites such as the dorsa of the hands , elbows and feet but involvement of the palms appears to be rare . occasional familial cases are described with the occurrence in twins , siblings , and members of successive generations . attempts to identify an associated hla sub - type have yielded disparate results in different population groups . linear ga , a follicular pustular form and popular umbilicated lesions in children have also been described . the condition manifests as numerous ( at least 10 , often hundreds to thousands ) small , asymptomatic , erythematous , violaceous , brown- or skin - colored papules . rarely , ga may be complicated by nerve involvement as a result of granulomatous inflammation surrounding cutaneous nerves and perineural infiltrates of histiocytes in the dermis . the differential diagnoses of localized ga include tineacorporis , pityriasis rosea , pityriasis rotunda , erythema annulare centrifugum , nummular eczema , discoid lupus erythematosus , psoriasis , necrobiosis lipoidica , morphea , hypertrophic lichen planus and erythema chronicum migrans . treatment options include topical or intralesional corticosteroids , imiquimod cream , topical calcineurin inhibitors ( tacrolimus , pimecrolimus ) , cryotherapy , and pulsed dye laser .","granuloma annulare is a benign , self - limiting , inflammatory and granulomatous disease of unknown etiology occurring in both adults and children .

"the ultimate goal of periodontal therapy includes not only the arrest of progressive 
 periodontal disease but also the restitution of those parts of the supporting apparatus 
 which have been destroyed by disease . regenerative procedures have been evaluated in 
 several studies using grafting materials , root surface conditioning , guided tissue 
 regeneration and application of growth factors . different materials have been introduced for bone defect filling , i.e. , autografts , 
 xenografts , allografts , and alloplasts . among the various subgroups of alloplastic bone 
 grafts , bioactive glass ( bg ) is a type of bioactive ceramic with the ability to improve 
 bone formation that has been assessed in experimental models . previous studies have shown that bg particles , when implanted in vivo , 
 incorporate into the connective tissue and undergo chemical transformation increasing 
 the ph of the site to approximately 10 . this process leads to 
 the formation of a silica gel on the surface of the particles and subsequently an 
 amorphous calcium phosphate layer is formed by the interaction between calcium and 
 phosphate from the bg and the surrounding medium . hench and polak ( 2002 ) have shown that the release of ions ( na , ca , and si ) from bg 
 materials controls the cell cycle leading to the differentiation and proliferation of 
 bone cells , modulating the expression of genes that regulate osteogenesis , and the 
 synthesis of growth factors . growth factors are vital modulators during this process which can induce the migration , 
 attachment , proliferation and differentiation of periodontal progenitor cells . platelet - rich plasma ( prp ) is a preparation of autologous plasma that contains a higher 
 platelet concentration , allowing it to deliver a greater concentration of autologous 
 growth factors such us platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) , transforming growth factor 
 beta ( tgf- ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , insulin - like growth 
 factor ( igf - i ) , and epithelial growth factor ( egf ) , that regulate cell proliferation , 
 chemotaxis and differentiation . some specific platelet growth factors , like pdgf and tgf- , could promote the 
 growth and differentiation of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone cells and could 
 be responsible for the clinical improvement observed in experimental sites . other interesting feature of prp is its 
 sticky consistency due to its high fibrin content . the fibrin component of prp may work 
 as a haemostatic agent aiding in stabilizing the graft material and the blood 
 clot . blood clot 
 immobilization has been suggested as an important event in the early phases of wound 
 healing of periodontal regenerative procedures . studies using histological techniques suggested that prp preparations may enhance local 
 bone formation , while 
 others did not confirm these 
 findings . clinical studies have reported that treatments with a combination of prp and 
 demineralized freeze - dried bone graft allograft ( dfdba ) improve clinical parameters in 
 intrabony periodontal defects . in 
 the other hand did nt find additional 
 benefit in the reduction of pocket depth , clinical attachment gain and defect filling 
 using prp with bg in the treatment of intrabony defects . the use of prp associated with biomaterials is an alternative treatment approach that 
 may favor the process of bone tissue regeneration and should be investigated . therefore , 
 the goal of this study was to evaluate , histomorphometrically , the healing of surgically 
 created intrabony defects in dogs treated with prp+bg . nine adult female mongrel dogs ( mean weight=15 kg ) were included in the experiment . the 
 study protocol was approved by the institutional animal research committee , state 
 university of campinas ( protocol # 686 - 1 ) . the surgical procedures were performed under 
 general anesthesia with intravenous injection of a 3% sodium pentobarbital solution ( 0.5 
 ml / kg ) . the mandibular second and fourth premolars had been previously extracted and the 
 extraction sites had been allowed to heal for 2 months . after this period , buccal and 
 lingual mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated and 3-wall intrabony defects ( 4x4x4 mm ) were 
 created at the mesial and distal aspect of the left and right mandibular first molar 
 ( figure 1 ) . following root planning , aiming cementum removal , a reference 
 notch was made with curettes on the root surface at the cement - enamel junction . clinical view of the surgically created 3-wall intrabony defect ( 4x4x4 mm ) at the 
 mesial aspect of the first mandibular molar before that the gingival flaps have been positioned and sutured , a tofflemire matrix 
 involved by cotton ligature was adapted over the tooth surface and the remaining defect 
 was filled with gutta - percha ( figure 2 ) . so , the 
 defects were exposed to plaque accumulation for a period of one month before the 
 treatment . after that , scaling and root planing was performed and a regimen of daily 
 brushing plus topical application of 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate was instituted for 7 
 days prior to the surgical procedures . clinical view of the insertion of gutta - percha in the defect blood was obtained several min before the administration of anesthesia . four 5-ml 
 tubes containing 0.5 ml of 3.2% sodium citrate solution ( an anticoagulant ) were drawn 
 from each dog . the blood was thus separated into 3 basic parts : red blood cells ( at the 
 bottom of the tube ) , platelet enriched plasma ( a discrete grey line in the middle of 
 the tube ) and platelet poor plasma ( at the top of the tube ) . the portion 
 corresponding to the platelet poor plasma was discarded from each tube and the 
 remaining content was centrifuged again at 1,200 rpm for 15 min . four hundred 
 microliters of the middle portion , corresponding to the platelet enriched plasma , 
 were pipetted from each tube . in order to obtain the gel , 30 l of 10% calcium 
 chloride was added to prp and heated in a water bath at 37c . the gel was achieved 
 after a period of 10 to 15 min . a tube with a sample of whole blood 
 as well as a sample of prp , retrieved before adding calcium chloride of 10% , was sent 
 to a clinical veterinary laboratory to perform a platelet counting . in the moment of the defect treatment , an apical reference notch was made with 
 curettes on the root surface at the remaining bone level . each defect in each animal 
 ( a total of 4 defects/ animal ) was randomly assigned to one of the following 
 treatments ( the treatments with prp were located at the same side that was randomly 
 determined ) : control : the defect was naturally filled with coagulum ; 
 bg ( perioglas , us biomaterials , alachua , fl , usa ) : bg particles 
 were applied , filling the defect ; prp : after obtaining the prp gel , 
 it was immediately applied on the defect ; prp+bg : bg was 
 incorporated to the prp ( 1:1 ) and this assemblage was immediately taken to a water 
 bath at 37c for formation of a mixture of the gel and the bg graft . primary , tension - free wound closure was accomplished following defect treatment , with 
 the gingival flaps positioned and sutured with interrupted sutures ( vicryl , ethicon 
 inc , so jos dos campos , sp , brazil ) at their presurgical position . immediately after the surgeries , an intramuscular injection of penicillin ( 1.5 ml  
 150,000 iu ) was given to the animal . postoperative plaque control was performed by irrigation with a solution of 1% 
 chlorhexidine gluconate ( every other day ) . after 90 days , under general anesthesia , 
 the animals were sacrificed with a perfusion of 10% neutral formalin solution . the 
 jaws were dissected and the blocks containing the experimental specimens were 
 removed , and decalcified in a solution of equal parts of 50% formic acid and 20% 
 sodium citrate for 5 months . the decalcified specimens were washed in running water , 
 dehydrated and embedded in paraffin . five sections representing the midbuccal portion of each defect were selected for the 
 histometric procedures . the 
 following distances were measured : total epithelium ( sulcular and junctional epithelium ) : from the 
 gingival margin to the apical border of the junctional epithelium . connective tissue adaptation ( without cementum ) : from the apical 
 border of the junctional epithelium to the coronal end of new cementum . new cementum : from the apical notch to the most coronal part of new 
 cementum . new bone ( bone position ) : from the apical notch to the most coronal 
 extent of new bone . negative values would be assigned if the bony crest was located 
 apically to the apical notch . new bone area : area of newly formed bone filling the defect area 
 ( limited by the distance between the two notches in an apico - coronal direction and 4 
 mm away from the root surface in a lateral direction ) . the area of new bone was 
 measured with an image analysis system that allowed the placement of a lattice on the 
 image of the created bone defect . the intersection lines localized on bone were 
 marked to calculate the new bone area whereas intersections lines localized on bg 
 particles were not marked and therefore were not included for this purpose . the measurements were performed using a microscope ( zeiss axioskop 2 , carl zeiss 
 instruments , gottingen , lower saxony , germany ) with a 1.25/.035 objective associated 
 with a video camera / computer / software ( image pro plus version 3.0 , media cybernetics , 
 silver spring , md , usa ) . the mean values for all 
 groups were determined using the individual means from the 9 dogs . the hypothesis 
 that there were no differences among the groups was tested by one - way anova . if a statistical 
 difference was detected , tukey s pairwise multiple comparison test was used . four 5-ml 
 tubes containing 0.5 ml of 3.2% sodium citrate solution ( an anticoagulant ) were drawn 
 from each dog . the blood was thus separated into 3 basic parts : red blood cells ( at the

 5 . the use of different regenerative approaches in the treatment of periodontal defects has 
 demonstrated a variable clinical result . some techniques have been used in association , aiming to increase 
 their effect on periodontal regeneration . the present study was 
 designed to evaluate , histomorphometrically , the healing process of 3-wall intrabony 
 defects treated with bg , prp and their association . prp has become a focus of current studies due to its potential to accelerate wound 
 healing . it has been previously shown that prp stimulated pdl 
 cells and fibroblastic cell proliferationbut suppressed 
 epithelial cell division in vitro . consequently , by ordering these cellular responses into a series 
 of related events , prp may facilitate wound - healing and tissue regeneration . the claimed 
 ability to suppress epithelial cell proliferation seems advantageous for periodontal 
 regeneration by favoring the formation of a new connective tissue attachment and new 
 cementum on the root surface . the 
 results of the present study failed to demonstrate that the use of prp can promote an 
 additional effect in terms of cementum formation when treating 3-wall intrabony defects . cementum formation for bg and prp followed the same trend observed for the control group 
 ( bg=2.5 mm/57% , prp=2.4 mm/53% , control=58% ) while the prp+bg showed a slightly greater 
 cementum formation ( prp+bg=3.10 mm/68% ) , but the differences among the groups were not 
 statistically significant . in this respect , it should be recognized that a non - contained 
 osseous defect might have favored the discrimination of quantitative differences among 
 the treatments . in a previous histological study , kim , et al ( 2004 ) evaluated the healing patterns following flap surgery in 
 experimentally induced 1- , 2- and 3-wall intrabony defects . according to the authors , 
 one- and 3-wall intrabony defects can be considered pre - clinical models that are 
 relatively easy to manage and from which homogeneous healing outcomes may be expected . they suggested that these defects appear to be reproducible models to evaluate candidate 
 technologies for periodontal regeneration . regarding the 3-wall intrabony defect , they reported a mean 
 cementum formation of approximately 70% of the initial defect extension . in the present 
 study , a period of 1 month of plaque accumulation was allowed as a way to obtain some 
 chronification of the defect . the control group showed 2.6 mm ( 58% ) of the original 
 defect covered with new cementum . this result confirms the high regenerative potential 
 of this type of defect that provides favorable anatomic characteristics for clot 
 stabilization and protection . it is well accepted that healing of intrabony defects is positively correlated to the 
 number of bone walls limiting the defect . therefore , the 3-wall intrabony defect used in 
 the present study provides ideal extent and location of tissue resources , cells and 
 vascularity circumscribing the defect , which might have favored bone formation . the 
 linear measurement of the new bone height revealed an impressive coronal bone formation 
 for all the groups , with no significant differences among the treatments . the claimed osteoinductive properties of prp could not be supported by the results of the present study . it 
 has been suggested that prp could be used to increase the bone deposition rate and the 
 quality of bone regeneration when augmenting sites prior to or in conjunction with 
 dental implant placement . nevertheless , more recent animal studies could not find 
 increased bone regeneration when prp was used . recently , bioactive glass has been used as a way to achieve bone and periodontal 
 regeneration based on its osteoconductive properties . the need for an 
 alternative to autologous and allogenic bone grafts have encouraged the search of a 
 material that could be safe , surgically convenient and predictably promote regeneration 
 with a reduced morbidity . in this study , the use of bg was not associated with any 
 foreign body reaction , showing biocompatibility with periodontal tissues . histological observations after treatment of periodontal defects with bg in nonhuman 
 primates showed a significant increase of new cementum and inhibition of downgrowth of 
 junctional epithelium . when bg is 
 implanted in vivo , the ph of the site increases , a layer rich in silica 
 gel is formed on the surface of the particles and subsequently an amorphous calcium 
 phosphate layer is formed by the interaction between calcium and phosphate from the bg 
 and the surrounding medium . its 
 superficial bioactivity may stimulate a rapid formation of a connective tissue seal that 
 is supposed to have the ability to block the epithelium migration and allow for the 
 repopulation of the previously contaminated area by periodontal ligament cells . in the present study , almost all defects 
 that received bg presented a dense connective tissue surrounding the remaining particles 
 in accordance with observations of previous studies . in the groups treated with bg , the area of new bone was 13.802.32 mm 
 ( prp+bg ) and 15.632.64 mm ( bg ) , respectively . in the groups that did not receive this material , the new bone area was 8.191.46 mm 
 ( control group ) and 8.811.47 mm ( prp ) . based on the significant 
 differences observed in the area of newly formed bone when groups with and without bg 
 were compared the present study corroborates the hypothesis that this material could act 
 as an osteoconductive graft . in addition , it was observed that some remaining bg 
 granules showed dissolution of their core with newly formed bone , as described in the 
 literature . aiming to increase the periodontal and bone regeneration , some studies evaluated the 
 additional effect of prp , combined with different types of grafting materials , on the 
 treatment of intrabony defects . in spite of some clinical results showing a greater 
 reduction of pocket depth and gain in clinical attachment level , other clinical studies 
 failed to demonstrate an additional effect . in 3-wall periimplant defects in dogs 
 treated with prp associated to xenogenic bone graft , the same 
 authors also reported no significant effect with the addition of prp to xenogenic bone 
 grafts on bone mineral density or graft maturity . these observations are in agreement with the results of the 
 present study , which could not demonstrate an additional effect of prp in periodontal 
 and bone regeneration of 3 wall intrabony defects . the histomorphometric findings 
 demonstrated that the sites treated with prp+bg showed a similar amount of new bone 
 ( 13.802.32 mm ) when compared with the sites that only received bg 
 ( 15.632.64 mm ) . the ideal platelet and growth factor concentration to promote periodontal regeneration 
 has not yet been established . to the date , there is insufficient information about 
 growth factor interactions and how they influence the activations of gene expression and 
 protein production . in the present study , the achieved percentage mean of platelet 
 concentration was 227.02% ( mean of 463.015 platelets / ml ) in relation to blood platelets 
 count . ( 2003 ) 
 reported that growth factors may act at specific times and at appropriate concentrations 
 and this may be other explanation for the different results obtained in studies 
 evaluating the use of prp . the great variability in the outcomes of the studies with prp 
 may also be explained by the diversity of methods to obtain it . the technique to produce 
 prp in the present study was used in other animal studies by our research 
 group . this technique enables the production of a platelet 
 concentration generally four times greater than the whole blood . according to landsberg , 
 et al . ( 1998 ) , thrombin promotes the 
 release of antibodies to coagulation factors v and vi , which could be a potentially 
 life - threatening event . these antibodies cross - react with human factor v thereby , 
 causing a factor v deficiency that can be sufficiently severe to induce excessive 
 bleeding and even death . considering that , the use of thrombin in this type of study is 
 not allowed in our country . in the present study , instead of thrombin , 10% calcium 
 chloride was added to prp and heated in a water bath at 37c . ( 2003 ) measured the concentrations of 
 bfgf , vegf , pdgf - bb and tgf-1 released from platelet concentrate and whole 
 blood , before and after the addition of calcium alone , thrombin alone and various 
 concentrations of calcium and thrombin . those authors observed that calcium chloride , 
 regardless of the use of thrombin , released platelet growth factors . in this 
 study , the concentration of 
 growth factors that was released was sufficient to promote endothelial cell 
 proliferation in vitro . recently , the tissue engineering science has provided a new possibility of cell therapy 
 as a future alternative for the use of conventional regenerative techniques . this strategy that exploits the 
 regenerative capacity of stem cells grown in a three - dimensional scaffold and 
 subsequently implanted into the defect , in the presence of molecule modulators , may help 
 overcoming several limitations of current regeneration modalities . in an in vitro study , 
 the application of growth factors found in prp ( tgf-1 and igf - i ) in cultures of 
 periodontal ligament cells , increased their mitotic activity and their capacity for 
 adhesion on the root fragments surface . the use of platelet 
 growth factors associated with cell therapy could be an alternative favoring the process 
 of periodontal regeneration . within the limits of this animal model study , it may be concluded that the association 
 of prp with bg did not exert an additional effect to periodontal regeneration of 3-wall 
 intrabony defects in dogs . further studies are necessary to investigate the advantages 
 and limitations of these materials in the treatment of periodontal defects .","objectivethis study was designed to evaluate , histomorphometrically , the association of

"the frequency of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) has been progressively increasing over the last two decades ( 1 ) and has become a worldwide public health problem . the prevalence of ckd is estimated to be 816% worldwide ( 2 ) . kidney transplantation is the best alternative treatment for end - stage renal disease and health - related quality of life and survival of the patients are improved compared with dialysis ( 3 , 4 ) . worldwide , more than 1.4 million patients with ckd receive renal replacement therapy with incidence growing by approximately 8% annually ( 5 ) . unfortunately , despite significant improvement in graft function , kidney transplants can still fail due to acute rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy ( 1 , 3 ) that can lead to three fold greater risk of death compared to patients with functioning grafts ( 1 , 6 ) . due to the increasing demand for renal transplants , identifying potential risk factors implicated in graft failure is essential to improve patient survival and quality of life ( 1 ) . to achieve this purpose , traditional statistical techniques such as cox proportional hazards ( ph ) model however , it relies on restrictive assumptions such as proportionality of hazards and linearity of effects on log hazard function ( linearity assumption ) ( 7 ) . besides , the performance of traditional methods like cox regression is not reliable in the presence of high rate of censoring ( 8) . potential prognostic factors affecting renal graft have also been investigated by several studies with cox ph model ( 3 , 9 , 10 ) . ideally , it would be important to improve the predictive performance of the models identifying potential prognostic factors affecting renal graft via learning theory and data mining techniques for survival time that require no assumptions . machine learning methods such as tree - based approaches have recently been developed to handle right censored survival data and their effective performance has been confirmed in different areas ( 11 ) . random survival forests ( rsf ) , is a non - parametric tree - based ensemble learning method that can automatically handle the difficulties of cox model and can also be used to select and rank variables ( 7 , 11 ) . due to the limitations of the cox model , using rsf to identify effective risk factors for survival has been suggested ( 7 ) . although , several studies have confirmed the promising performance of rsf compared to traditional cox model ( 8 , 1214 ) in different disease , there is no attempt to use rsf in renal transplantation and compare its performance with cox model . this study aimed to identify prognostic factors affecting renal graft by rsf and compare its performance with cox proportional hazard model . the present study utilized a data set corresponds to a retrospective cohort study which was conducted in hamadan , western iran , from 1994 to 2011 . the number of 475 patients underwent kidney transplantation in ekbatan or besaat hospitals and was eligible to enroll the study . to identify important risk factors , the patients who did not have any information about risk factors were eliminated from the analysis . in this regard , only 378 out of 475 patients were considered in the present study because the information about potential risk factors was not observed for the rest of the patients . the risk factors were age , sex of donors and recipients , type of donor ( living - donor or deceased donor ) , familial relationship , hemoglobin level , blood groups of donors and recipients , duration of dialysis before transplantation ( year ) , cold ischemic time ( min ) , creatinine level at discharge , body mass index ( bmi ) of donor ( kg / m2 ) , left or right kidney , type of immunosuppressive drugs used ( imuran , prednisolone , cyclosporine vs. cellcept , prednisolone , cyclosporine ) , duration of hospitalization ( day ) , volume of urine excretion during the first 24 h after transplantation ( ml/24 h ) , and occurrence of acute or hyperacute rejection . in this regard , acute rejection is related to formation of cellular immunity , which usually occurs to some degree in all grafts , except between identical twins and hyperacute rejection is initiated by preexisting humoral immunity and usually manifests within minutes after transplantation ( 3 ) . the survival time was the time between kidney transplantation and episode of rejection ( 3 ) . rsf is an extension of random forest rf to right - censored survival data with the same principles underlying rf , which enjoys all its important properties ( 7 , 15 ) . each tree consists of nodes ( variables ) in which classification or split was implemented . in survival settings , tree node splits according to maximizing survival differences between daughter nodes ( new nodes ) . in this regard , in each tree , survival time and status of the patients were considered as response variables . then , the ensemble estimate for the cumulative hazard function ( chf ) is drawn by calculating the chf for each sample in a data set , and summing this ensemble over the observed survival times yields the predicted outcome referred to as ensemble mortality ( a measure of mortality for a patient that has been shown to be an effective predictor of survival ) ( 15 ) . each run of rsf was performed for the kidney transplant data set based on 1000 trees under log - rank splitting rule . the importance of each model covariate was also determined by a rapidly computable internal measure of variable importance ( vimp ) that can be used to rank variables . the larger vimp , the more predictive the variable ( the threshold value is 0.002 ) ( 11 ) . moreover , multiple imputation strategy based on rf was utilized for treating missing data ( 7 ) . five imputed data set were provided and then combining rules ( 16 , 17 ) were applied to calculate evaluation criteria and vimp . in order to compare the performance of rsf and traditional cox ph , two criteria were used including integrated brier score ( 18 ) and c - index ( 19 ) using out - of - bag ( oob ) data . a perfect prediction rule would have a concordance of 1 ( 20 ) . random - forestsrc  , a freely available package from the comprehensive r archive network ( cran ) . the mean survival time for 378 patients was 7.354.62 yr , the median survival time was 6.81 yr . out of 378 transplantations , 37 ( 10% ) episodes of rejection occurred , and the remaining 341 patients ( 90% ) were censored . mean and standard deviation of variable importance ( vimp ) for kidney transplant data over five imputed data set . each run based on 1000 trees under log - rank splitting the cold ischemic time , recipient s age , creatinine level at discharge and donors age are highly predictive , and duration of hospitalization is moderately predictive . however , type of donors , hemoglobin level , donor s sex , immunosuppressive drug usage , post - transplantation condition , recipient sex , familial relationship , donor and recipient blood group , side of the kidney , duration of dialysis and urine volume are unlikely to be predictive . according to cox ph model , three variables of recipient age , type of donor ( living vs. deceased ) , and episode of post - transplantation acute and hyperacute rejection were identified as most important variables . rsf had lower prediction error based on integrated brier score ( 0.081 ) compared to cox model ( 0.088 ) . in addition , the c - index of rsf was considerably higher ( 0.965 ) than that of the cox model ( 0.766 ) . the effect on survival of the most five influential covariates found in the rsf analysis was displayed with 5-yr partial survival plots in fig . 1 . the estimated partial survival for a covariate indicates estimated survival for different levels of the covariate when the effects of all other covariates are justified . it can be seen from figure that , as cold ischemic time increases up to about 35 minute , the five - year predicted survival increases as well and it tends to decline after 35 minute . partial 5-year predicted survival for five most influential covariates on survival in kidney transplant data . rsf identified cold ischemic time , recipient s age , creatinine level at discharge , donor s age and duration of hospitalization as the top five most important predictors of survival for graft failure patients in the present study . several authors estimated the survival rate of kidney transplantation and detected the risk factors of graft rejection ( 2124 ) . our results showed that the cold ischemic time variable was the most important factor in the risk of graft rejection , which is consistent with the results of some other studies ( 25 , 26 ) . cold ischemic time is one of the risk factors that is involved in immediate anemia in renal transplant recipients ( 27 ) . based on the results , as recipient s age increases predicted five - year survival time increases as well . this may be a result of stronger and more efficient immune system in younger recipients ( 3 ) . previous studies have reported creatinine level at discharge as a risk factor in rejection of kidney transplantation ( 9 , 10 , 32 ) . donor age was the fourth top risk factor , which had a negative correlation with graft rejection , i.e. kidney rejection is more likely among those recipients who receive kidney from older donors . this result is also similar to the result of other studies ( 3 , 25 , 26 , 33 , 34 ) . the fifth top most important variable was duration of hospitalization , confirmed eralier ( 35 , 36 ) . this study focused on the performance of rsf method in identifying potential risk factors for survival of kidney graft failure patients compared to traditional cox model . the results demonstrated that the rsf model performed significantly better than the conventional cox - proportional hazard model . several studies also confirmed the promising performance of rsf compared to cox ph model in real data sets ( 8 , 12 , 14 ) . rsf had better performance compared to cox ph model based on prediction error criterion ( 13 ) . therefore , it can be applied successfully for identifying risk factors of the kidney transplantation survival . rsf deals with the traditional cox model issues such as proportionality assumption coherently and automatically ( 37 ) and analysts do not require knowing in advance the relationship ( i.e. linear , nonlinear ) of a variable over time ( 8) . besides , the performance of cox regression is not reliable in the presence of high rate of censoring which was the case in the present study ( about 90% censor rate ) . while , rsf is a robust extension of random forest a highly used machine learning method that has gained much interest in a variety of fields of application and generated a vast amount of computational literature in the last decade ( 8 , 38 ) . however , the performance of different methods is data dependent and conducting additional studies is needed to compare rsf to cox regression to document further its performance in clinical settings ( 8) . there were some limitations in the present study . reliable sources of data obtained from prospective design were required for estimation of survival rate and associated prognostic factors , but the present study used a data set of a retrospective cohort study and medical records . quality and accuracy of estimates depends primarily on the quality of recorded data , but verifying the accuracy of data was not possible in the present study . besides , quality of the services and technology may vary over time , but we have no document to justify this issue . these issues might bias results . in addition , long - term follow - up duration results in losing some patients , which in turn may lead to biased results ( 3 ) . rsf identified a different subset of risk factors in chronic nonreversible renal graft rejection than the cox ph model . the rsf is a promising method for intuitive variable selection and is a way to eliminate the doubt in the  black box approach to statistical analysis that should be further investigated in survival analysis of other diseases ( 8) . ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc . ) have been completely observed by the authors .","background : kidney transplantation is the best alternative treatment for end - stage renal disease . 
 several studies have been devoted to investigate predisposing factors of graft rejection 
 . however , there is inconsistency between the results . 
 the objective of the present study was to utilize an intuitive and robust approach for variable selection , random survival forests ( rsf ) , and to identify important risk factors in kidney transplantation patients.methods:the data set included 378 patients with kidney transplantation obtained through a historical cohort study in hamadan , western iran , from 1994 to 2011 . 
 the event of interest was chronic nonreversible graft rejection and the duration between kidney transplantation and rejection was considered as the survival time . 
 rsf method was used to identify important risk factors for survival of the patients among the potential predictors of graft rejection.results:the mean survival time was 7.354.62 yr . 
 thirty - seven episodes of rejection were occurred . 
 the most important predictors of survival were cold ischemic time , recipient s age , creatinine level at discharge , donors age and duration of hospitalization . 
 rsf method predicted survival better than the conventional cox - proportional hazards model ( out - of - bag c - index of 0.965 for rsf vs. 0.766 for cox model and integrated brier score of 0.081 for rsf vs. 0.088 for cox model).conclusion : a rsf model in the kidney transplantation patients outperformed traditional cox - proportional hazard model . 
 rsf is a promising method that may serve as a more intuitive approach to identify important risk factors for graft rejection .",331
"acromegaly is serious endocrinological derangement which , left untreated , reduces life expectancy and results in physiological derangements and complications that may negatively affect a patient 's quality of life . those patients with residual or recurrent disease are often treated with medication to decrease growth hormone secretion or block its action on peripheral tissues . these treatments are not universally effective for patients and are sometimes contraindicated . as an adjunct treatment , and sometimes as an alternative treatment , radiosurgery has proven to be an attractive therapy . it is noninvasive , has few side effects , and is available in many centers internationally [ 13 ] . in the current paper , we first describe the pathophysiology of acromegaly , the existing surgical and medical treatments , and then introduce radiosurgical methods . in particular , we will focus on gamma knife radiosurgery ( gks ) since it has a broader base of supporting literature than alternative forms of stereotactic radiosurgery . finally , the overall efficacy of gks is described , along with its reported morbidities . acromegaly is a syndrome caused by elevated levels of circulating growth hormone ( gh ) . the most common cause of the disorder , accounting for about 98% of cases , is a gh - secreting pituitary adenoma . rare nonpituitary causes of acromegaly include diverse entities such as hypothalamic hamartomas , small - cell lung cancers , pheochromocytomas , and bronchial carcinoids . among gh - secreting pituitary adenomas , roughly 60% are pure gh - secreting somatotrope adenomas , while the remainder are mixed mammosomatotropes , which secrete both gh and prolactin ( prl ) and sometimes thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) . the symptoms of increased gh are mediated by both the direct effects of gh binding to the gh receptor , activating the jak / stat pathway , and indirectly via insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 ) . the combined effects of gh and igf-1 on target tissues lead to bony and soft tissue growth , noted by a characteristic constellation of signs including frontal bossing , prognathism , widely spaced teeth ( due to mandibular growth ) , increased shoe or ring sizes , skin tags , carpal tunnel syndrome , and coarse facial features . these externally recognizable signs in themselves are not as important to overall morbidity as internal changes , including cardiomegaly and visceromegaly [ 4 , 5 ] . diabetes mellitus occurs in roughly 25% of patients , and cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia , hypertension , and diastolic dysfunction occurs in 30% . additionally , colonic polyps are more frequent , as is sleep apnea which occurs in 60% of patients , presumably secondary to soft tissue expansion and macroglossia . multiple studies through the 1920s to 1990s agreed on a prevalence of roughly 60 per million , a mean age of onset of 44 years , symptoms lasting on average 8 years before diagnosis , and no difference in incidence between men and women . however , more recent studies place the prevalence at 86 per million , 124 per million , and a remarkably high 1034 per million . however , in addition to being geographically and demographically restricted ( primary care patients in germany ) , this last study was based on a biochemical definition of acromegaly ( elevated igf-1 and gh ) rather than a syndrome definition , and therefore will include many patients who would otherwise not seek treatment . such a more liberal definition might be one method of discovering at - risk patients earlier in the course of their disease and permitting more time to mitigate the accruing morbidity . surgery is typically the first line of treatment for acromegaly due to pituitary adenomas provided there are no surgical contraindications . residual disease is then managed medically with somatostatin analogues , dopamine agonists , or gh receptor antagonists . most adenomas are resected via the transsphenoidal approach ( transsphenoidal adenomectomy , tsa ) . using either a microscope or endoscope , the surgeon enters the sphenoid sinus transnasally , then penetrates the sella , and finally debulks and removes the tumor , sparing as much of the normal pituitary as possible . for microadenomas ( < 10  mm in diameter ) , tsas lead to correction of gh levels in ~70% of patients . only 50% of patients with macroadenomas achieve normalization . for those patients who do not experience normalization of gh levels after surgery , or who are not surgical candidates , the lar ( long - acting release ) formulation of octreotide uses polymeric microspheres and is injected monthly . lanreotide atg ( autogel ) is the only formulation of lanreotide currently available in the united states and is suspended in aqueous solution in microsyringes for subcutaneous delivery by the patient . the two formulations appear to be equally efficacious and normalize igf - i levels in 5060% of patients [ 1316 ] . somatostatin analogues appear to induce tumor shrinkage in approximately 42% of patients , when data are pooled across studies . interestingly , however , tumor shrinkage appears more pronounced in primarily treated patients ( 52% ) as opposed to patients receiving adjunctive , postsurgical treatment ( 21% ) . dopamine agonists appear to work best in patients whose tumors also secrete prolactin . among dopamine agonists , cabergoline appears to be the most efficacious , resulting in normalization of igf - i levels in 34% of patients . however , no dopamine agonist alone is as effective as a somatostatin analogue , although there might be synergistic effects when used in conjunction with somatostatin analogues [ 2124 ] . pegvisomant is a pegylated growth hormone analogue that is subcutaneously injected by patients . in one study , treatment for 12 months led to normalized igf-1 levels in 97% of patients , and treatment for 24 months led to normalization in 76.3% of patients in a different study . however , the side effects of pegvisomant include transaminitis , lipodystrophy at injection sites , and , most worrisome , possible tumor progression , due to blocking of the normal inhibitory feedback of growth hormone levels of the adenoma [ 2729 ] . simply put , resective surgery is a means of removing unwanted tissue from the body . radiosurgery ( rs ) achieves the identical goal but , rather than directly removing cells , induces cell death instead . this cell death can be induced either directly , via necrosis or apoptosis , or indirectly , by damaging the tissue blood supply . when inducing cell death , rs uses ionizing radiation , wherein charged particles or photons strip electrons from atoms and molecules , thereby damaging dna , proteins , and other molecules within cells and in the extracellular matrix . when this damage can not be repaired , cells undergo either apoptosis or necrosis [ 30 , 31 ] . various types of radiosurgery are available , but each works by emitting charged particles or photons . proton beams , for example , generated by particle accelerators and can be used to target structures deep within the cranium . this is due , in part , to the characteristic peak and subsequent drop - off of radiation intensity in proton beams  the bragg peak . the depth of this peak can be modulated and is used to focus the effects of the radiation on particular structures , sparing healthy ones . the drawback to proton therapy , however , is the high cost and relative scarcity of facilities capable of providing therapeutic proton beams . the two major techniques are linear accelerators and radioactive isotopes . linear accelerators , like the cyberknife ( accuray inc . , sunnyvale , ca ) , produce photons which are then aimed toward deep structures within the brain or spine . to limit damage along the path of the beam thus , the target of the beam is constant , always receiving radiation , but the intervening structures are exposed only briefly [ 3032 ] . the gamma knife ( elekta ab , stockholm , sweden ) , developed by lars leksell in 1968 , each source generates a beam of photons as the cobalt decays , and these beams are focused on a central target within the brain through the use of collimators . because each individual beam is weak , intervening tissue is exposed to far less radiation than the central target , which is the common focus of all 201 beams . the gamma knife has been around longer than most linear accelerator radiosurgical devices and is therefore a better - studied tool for use by neurosurgeons , though direct comparisons between the gamma knife and linear accelerators will undoubtedly change the prevailing practices in the future . a large number of small case series have been carried out to evaluate the effects of gamma knife surgery ( gks ) on acromegaly ( table 1 ) . most use remission criterion of a normal igf-1 level and many add the criterion gh < 1 to 2  ng / ml , but it should be noted that remission criteria vary across studies . these criteria are roughly in line with the criteria set forth by the acromegaly consensus group on 2010 ( normal igf-1 and gh < 1  ng / ml ) . also variable between studies is the follow - up time , along with radiation dose , targeting protocol , and , most critically , pre - gks therapy . this last note is particularly important since most series include patients who have already received transsphenoidal surgical resection as an inadequate treatment . unfortunately , the data are not presented in the reviewed papers in such a way as to separate out response rates in patients receiving prior treatment versus those who were treated primarily with gks . overall , however , the results from these studies suggest that gks is an effective treatment for acromegaly . across the 29 studies and 964 cases examined , 43% of patients achieved remission . the time to remission is not reliably reported , but most studies agree that the further out from rs patients are examined , the more likely they are to achieve a cure . for example , vik - mo et al .   showed an increase from 58% of patients with normal igh-1 levels to 86% of patients over the time span of 5 to 10 years after rs . how exactly the effects of rs continue to evolve over such a protracted time is unknown , but consistent with how rs affects other diseases , like epilepsy   and vestibular schwannoma . interestingly , there is some ( still debated ) evidence that the use of antiacromegalic medicines prior to irradiation attenuates the effects of gks . that is , using somatostatin analogues or gh receptor antagonists has been shown in select studies to decrease a patient 's chances of remission [ 3739 ] . though this has not been thoroughly examined , the mechanism is believed to be suppression of tumor cell cycle , thereby making the cells less prone to radiation - induced damage . there does not appear to be a correlation between radiation dose and rates of remission ( figure 1 ) . however , the heterogeneity in study design , follow - up , and definition of remission makes such conclusions fraught . the most common complication of gks for acromegaly is hypopituitarism , presumably from damage to the normal gland during irradiation , ranging from 0 to 43%   ( table 2 ) . however , the degree to which such damage is a pure result of gks versus prior surgery , if done , is unclear . moreover , there is no discernible relationship between radiation dose and the incidence of this complication ( figure 2 ) , though these are very heterogeneous studies and it is possible that better - controlled or larger studies would uncover such relationships if they exist . other complications are inadequately documented but include headache , epilepsy , carotid artery stenosis , and , more frequently , cranial nerve palsies or neuropathies ( including trigeminal neuralgia and visual decline )   ( table 2 ) . the rate of visual disturbances seems to be , in the worst case , 11% [ 40 , 41 ] , though most trials either do not report these adverse events or show them to be on the order of 06% ( table 2 ) . nevertheless , these complications should be viewed in light of the complications inherent to uncontrolled acromegaly or , if being used as an alternative to surgery , the morbidity of an endonasal neurosurgical procedure . while surgical resection remains the first line of treatment , stereotactic radiosurgery is proving itself a feasible alternative therapy ( when surgery might be contraindicated ) and adjunct ( when surgical resection is unsuccessful in leading to complete disease remission ) . ultimately , further studies are needed to delineate which patients are most likely to receive benefit from gks , along with ways to improve gks outcomes .","acromegaly is debilitating disease occasionally refractory to surgical and medical treatment . 
 stereotactic radiosurgery , and in particular gamma knife surgery ( gks ) , has proven to be an effective noninvasive adjunct to traditional treatments , leading to disease remission in a substantial proportion of patients . 
 such remission holds the promise of eliminating the need for expensive medications , along with side effects , as well as sparing patients the damaging sequelae of uncontrolled acromegaly . 
 numerous studies of radiosurgical treatments for acromegaly have been carried out . 
 these illustrate an overall remission rate over 40% . 
 morbidity from radiosurgery is infrequent but can include cranial nerve palsies and hypopituitarism . 
 overall , stereotactic radiosurgery is a promising therapy for patients with acromegaly and deserves further study to refine its role in the treatment of affected patients .",181
"chemically , it is a hydrophilic base which exists at physiological ph as the cationic species . this drug was observed to reduce hypergly - cemia , improve glucose utilization , reduce free fatty acid utilization , gluconeogenesis , serum lipids , insulin , insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 ) , reduce body weight , and decrease metabolic immunodepression both in humans and rodents.[14 ] various studies revealed that mf is more than a simple antidiabetic agent . indeed , for an equivalent effect on glycemic control after a long time of treatment , mf was found to be obviously superior to other therapeutic measures for reducing vessel diseases and all - cause related mortality . it was suggested that insulin and mf treatments , y improving glycoxidative , inflammatory , and fibrotic renal damage markers , play a key role in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy . the role of mitochondria in programmed cell death is associated with the release of apoptotic signaling molecules . the production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) by mitochondria also contributes to cell degradation process . mitochondria are believed to have a role in a various renal diseases , and mitochondrial dysfunction could have a major role in nephrotoxicity . gentamicin ( gm ) is probably the most the commonly used and studied of all the aminoglycosides . hence , gm - enhanced ros formation in isolated cortical mitochondria[1117 ] and ros - induced cell death were found to have a role in gm - mediated acute renal failure . apart from the superiority of mf to other antidiabetic drugs , various investigations strongly suggest that this antidiabetic agent prevented oxidative stress - induced death in several cell types through a mechanism dependent on the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( ptp ) opening.[68131719 ] thus , mf may afford protection against gm - induced tubular injury by affecting the mitochondria through a mechanism dependent on the mitochondrial ptp opening . however , less data are present regarding the renoprotective effects of mf , and previous studies on attenuation of gm tubular toxicity by mf need to be re - tested . therefore , we aimed to test the potential properties of mf to protect the kidney from gm - induced acute renal failure . also , finding whether delayed treatment with mf exerts similar benefits on gm - induced renal toxicity in rats was the second aim of this study . mf ( metformin hexal ; germany ) was supplied as a white powder , soluble in distilled water , and freshly prepared as an aqueous solution to be given as a single daily oral dose of 100 mg / kg / day . gm treatment protocols used in the present study have been reported earlier . in a preclinical study , 50 male wistar rats with a weight range of 200250 g , purchased from jundishapur university of medical sciences , ahvaz , iran , were transferred to the animal house of shahrekord university of medical sciences , shahrekord , iran . animals were housed at an environment of controlled temperature ( 25  3c ) and humidity ( 5060% ) with a 12-hour dark  light cycle ( lights on at 7 am ) and free access to pelleted diet and tap water for 2 weeks to acclimatize to the new environment . the animal experimentation was conducted in accordance with the national institute of health guide for the careful use of laboratory animals . the animals were divided into five groups ( 10 rats each ) as follows : on the first day ( before experiment ) and the final day ( day of sacrificing ) , serum samples were obtained to measure blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and serum creatinine ( cr ) for all the rats . bun and cr levels were measured by a colorimetric method using commercial kits on an autoanalyzer . the kidneys of each animal were dissected out , then fixed in buffered formalin for 12 h and processed for histopathologic examination . three - micrometer - thick paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h and e ) for light microscope examination using conventional protocol . slides were coded and examined by a histopathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups . all specimens were examined for six morphologic parameters including epithelial cell vacuolization , degeneration , tubular cell flattening , hyaline cast , tubular dilatation , and debris materials in tubular lumen on a semi - quantitative score from 1 to 5 , while the score of zero was assigned to the normal tissue without damage . the t - paired test was used to compare the serum bun and cr levels before and after the experiments . one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied to compare the serum bun and cr levels between the groups . to compare the pathology damage score between the groups , kruskal mf ( metformin hexal ; germany ) was supplied as a white powder , soluble in distilled water , and freshly prepared as an aqueous solution to be given as a single daily oral dose of 100 mg / kg / day . in a preclinical study , 50 male wistar rats with a weight range of 200250 g , purchased from jundishapur university of medical sciences , ahvaz , iran , were transferred to the animal house of shahrekord university of medical sciences , shahrekord , iran . animals were housed at an environment of controlled temperature ( 25  3c ) and humidity ( 5060% ) with a 12-hour dark  light cycle ( lights on at 7 am ) and free access to pelleted diet and tap water for 2 weeks to acclimatize to the new environment . the animal experimentation was conducted in accordance with the national institute of health guide for the careful use of laboratory animals . the animals were divided into five groups ( 10 rats each ) as follows : on the first day ( before experiment ) and the final day ( day of sacrificing ) , serum samples were obtained to measure blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and serum creatinine ( cr ) for all the rats . bun and cr levels were measured by a colorimetric method using commercial kits on an autoanalyzer . the kidneys of each animal were dissected out , then fixed in buffered formalin for 12 h and processed for histopathologic examination . three - micrometer - thick paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h and e ) for light microscope examination using conventional protocol . slides were coded and examined by a histopathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups . all specimens were examined for six morphologic parameters including epithelial cell vacuolization , degeneration , tubular cell flattening , hyaline cast , tubular dilatation , and debris materials in tubular lumen on a semi - quantitative score from 1 to 5 , while the score of zero was assigned to the normal tissue without damage . the t - paired test was used to compare the serum bun and cr levels before and after the experiments . one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied to compare the serum bun and cr levels between the groups . to compare the pathology damage score between the groups , kruskal  wallis and mann  whitney u - test were applied . the levels of bun in groups ii , iv , and v , and the serum levels of cr in groups ii and v were increased significantly after the experiment ( p < 0.05 ) . the serum levels of bun and cr before and after the experiment in five groups of animals . group i , sham group ;

 the rats received gm ( 100 mg / kg ; intraperitoneally ) for 10 days and 100 mg / kg / day mf orally for the next 10 days . in the last group ( group v ) , 
 the rats received a combination of gm 100 mg / kg / day intraperitoneally and mf 100 mg / kg / day orally for 10 days simultaneously . 
 serum blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and creatinine ( cr ) values were measured and renal tissues of the animals were processed for light microscope examination.results:the levels of bun in groups ii , iv , and v , and also the serum level of cr in groups ii and v were increased significantly after the experiment . 
 furthermore , post - treatment with mf or co - treatment with mf could prevent the elevation of serum bun and cr induced by gm and also attenuates the damage score ( p < 0.05).conclusions : mf may prevent or ameliorate gm - induced acute renal failure , and therefore it might be beneficial in patients under treatment with this medicine .",361
"congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( cah ) refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by an enzyme deficiency which leads to defects in biosynthesis of steroid precursors . depending on the severity and degree of 21 hydroxylase deficiency , the clinical spectrum may vary from mild form of non classical cah to classic cah . however , the non classical cah variant is more common with a prevalence rate of 1 in 1000 . it also helps in maintaining normal levels of precursors by suppressing adreno cortico trophic hormone ( acth ) . during childhood , the management is largely focused on achieving normal growth and attaining appropriate final adult height . johns medical college hospital , bangalore by the department of endocrinology on patients diagnosed to have cah and seen in the outpatient clinic between january 2012 and october 2012 . during this period data regarding demography , clinical presentation at time of diagnosis , treatment details , height sds and bmi were collected . all patients underwent biochemical testing for 17 hydroxy progesterone ( 17 ohp ) levels for assessment of adequacy of therapy . bone age assessment with left hand and wrist bmi was calculated for all patients and obesity was defined using who charts as values above 95th percentile . 17 ohp levels between 1 ng / ml and 12 ng / ml were considered appropriate ; values below 1 ng / ml suggested suppression and over treatment and values above 12 ng / ml suggested under treatment . 29 patients were included in the study of which 22 were females ( 76% ) and 7 were males ( 24% ) . based on the cross sectional data collected , 11 patients were adults ( age > 18 ) and 18 patients were children ( 62% ) . among the males , one child was identified at birth via a neonatal screening program , one child presented with early pubarche , the other 5 infants presented between their 3rd and 6th week of life with features suggestive of adrenal crisis - poor feeding , vomiting and failure to gain weight . one of the male patients incidentally also had a penoscrotal hypospadias which was surgically corrected . among the females , 9 infants were identified at birth due to presence of genital ambiguity ( 40% ) , 1 presented with symptoms of adrenal crisis at 4 weeks of life , 4 patients presented in the pre pubertal period due to early onset adrenarche ( 18% ) , 5 patients presented in the late adolescent period with marked virilization ( 23% ) and 3 patients presented with features of poly cystic ovarian disease ( pcos ) . all the five patients who presented in the late adolescent period had obvious genital ambiguity from birth , however , they sought medical attention only much later due to marked virilization and failure to attain menarche . one among them had actually been evaluated and even underwent a clitoroplasty at a young age , but unfortunately , the diagnosis of cah was missed as she was mistakenly categorized as probable ovo testicular dsd due to presence of mullerian structures with a phallic length of around 6 cm . all these 5 women had a masculine built at presentation with poor breast development , severe hirsutism , muscular body habitus , temporal balding and varying degrees of deepening of voice . the non classical cah ( nccah ) patients presented in adulthood with complaints of irregular cycles and hirsutism ; they had no features of virilisation . simple virilizing was the most common sub class seen among the women ( 81% ) whereas the salt wasting type was predominant among boys ( 85% ) . around 35% of patients had short stature as defined by height sds < -2.0 ; 2 patients who presented with adrenarche had increase in height sds , however , their bone age was also correspondingly advanced . all the children were treated with hydrocortisone ; almost all adult patients were on dexamethasone . none of the nccah patients were treated with glucocorticoids ; they were on anti - androgen therapy along with oral contraceptive pills . most adult classic cah patients with complaints of hirsutism were treated with either spironolactone or finasteride . pubertal induction with ethinyl estradiol was initiated for three of the adult patients who sought medical care late . analysis of 17 ohp levels revealed that 32% were suppressed with levels less than 1ng / ml ;

 of promature eimeripain was also detected in schizonts ( fig . these results show that antisera against recombinant eimeripain 
 and eimeripain mature domain recognize promature and mature eimeripain , respectively , and 
 that mature eimeripain is undetectable or does not exist in invasive zoites like sporozoites

 detected only in early schizonts at around 10 m in size , as constellations 
 of dots in the cytoplasm ( fig . 5afig . 5.immunofluorescent staining of asexual stages , the second generation schizonts ( a ) and

 over the entire cytoplasm surrounding the nuclei in small immature schizonts and in 
 developmental second - generation schizonts of middle size ( around 20 m ) 
 with the strongest reactivity ( fig . 5d and 5e ) . in 
 mature schizonts , this reactivity became weak and seemed to be present only between 
 merozoites in the mature schizonts ( fig . reactivity of promature eimeripain was similar to 
 that of the second generation , and this enzyme was observed as dots in the cytoplasm . mature 
 eimeripain was present as dots in the cytoplasm of small immature third schizonts and

 shown ) . immunofluorescent staining of asexual stages , the second generation schizonts ( a ) and

 prominent wall forming body , micro - gametocytes and zygotes , respectively . scale bar is 10 m . ) and different from those of the asexual stages described above . both types of 
 eimeripain were observed in the wall - forming bodies and cytoplasm of immature 
 macro - gametocytes , only in the wall - forming bodies of mature macro - gametocytes , and across 
 the cytoplasm of micro - gametocytes . in zygotes signals were present over the entire 
 cytoplasm , except in the nuclei . at the oocyst formation stage , the final step of sexual 
 development , which is seen as a distorted shape , eimeripain was weakly observed in the 
 cytoplasm around the inner oocyst wall as spots ( fig . immunofluorescent staining of sexual stage with antibodies against promature ( a ) and 
 mature ( b ) eimeripain . arrowheads , arrows and asterisks show macro - gametocytes with a 
 prominent wall forming body , micro - gametocytes and zygotes , respectively . eimeripain has been proposed as a candidate drug target to be exploited against chicken 
 coccidiosis in the future [ 8 , 10 ] . in those studies , a panel of inhibitors was tested against the 
 enzyme and three new inhibitors were identified . moreover , it was confirmed that eimeripain was expressed in the extracellular stage during 
 sporulation ; however , no other life cycle stage 
 was examined for its expression so far . in the present study , we generated two antisera 
 against eimeripain ; one recognized promature eimeripain , while the other recognized 
 eimeripain by western blotting . as a result , the eimeripain was detected as protein of 
 promature at examined in all examined stages of sporulated oocysts , and purified 
 sporozoites , merozoites and schizonts . while , mature protein was identified as 33 kda 
 molecule only at sporulated oocysts and schizonts , but not sporozoites and merozoites . probably , the epitope recognized by anti - peptide sera against eimeripain mature domain might 
 be masked by the modification of carbohydrate chain or protein folding in promature 
 eimeripain before maturation . interestingly , this polyclonal antibody also identified a 54 
 kda band in schizonts , but did not react with sporozoites or merozoites . there is a 
 possibility that purified schizonts represent many developmental stages from immature to 
 mature second - generation schizonts , and thus , mature eimeripain of 54 kda might be contained 
 before complete maturation . these results suggest that mature eimeripain do not exist in 
 invasive zoites , but only in sporulated oocysts and developmental schizonts . by indirect immunofluorescence assay , the reactivities of promature eimeripain in 
 sporozoites and merozoites were similar to that seen in transfected sporozoites , as 
 previously reported , but mature eimeripain was 
 not . in intracellular developmental stages , the promature enzyme was detected in the 
 cytoplasm of early schizonts of the second and third generations , but disappeared during 
 their respective developments . meanwhile , mature protein was present in the entire 
 cytoplasm , but later was not detected . thus , the promature protein is present as dots in the 
 early asexual schizonts and probably sporozoites and merozoites as well , and active 
 eimeripain might spread throughout the cytoplasm during development or differentiation of 
 schizonts . these findings tempt speculation that eimeripain might play a key role in the 
 differentiation of intracellular zoites in the ceca in addition to the extracellular 
 stage . cathepsins , which are cysteine proteases related to papain - like enzymes ( clan ca , family 
 c1 ) , are major virulence factors expressed by apicomplexan parasites [ 1 , 3 , 11 ] . for instance , in toxoplasma gondii , antisense or 
 inhibitors of cathepsin b can block the invasion of tachyzoites into host cells and cause 
 abnormal rhoptry morphology . in higher eukaryotic 
 cells , however , the lysosomal system of e. tenella , like that of 
 toxoplasma gondii , has not been characterized . in our study , eimeripain 
 was expressed in all examined intracellular stages at both mrna and protein levels . although 
 more detailed functional characteristics remain to be analyzed , this enzyme might correlate 
 with asexual and sexual development with a fundamental biological function . therefore , the 
 results reported here offer evidence that compounds of inhibitors could be effective 
 candidates for novel drug discovery against chicken coccidiosis .","abstracthemorrhagic diarrhea in 
 poultry is caused by eimeria tenella , the most pathogenic avian coccidian 
 parasite , and new approaches to treat the disease are continually being sought .

 eimeripain , a cathepsin b - like cysteine protease from e. tenella , has 
 recently been identified as a novel anticoccidial drug target , its localization during the 
 intracellular development of parasites remains unclear . 
 here , we demonstrate the 
 expression of eimeripain during asexual and sexual development of e. tenella in 
 vivo . 
 promature eimeripain was detected only in the early immature second 
 generation of schizonts . 
 in contrast , the mature eimeripain was most strongly detected in 
 the middle - sized immature second generation of schizonts . 
 both promature and mature 
 eimeripain disappeared depending on the maturation level of second generation of 
 schizonts , but were strongly expressed again in the third generation of schizonts . in the 
 sexual stage , 
 both promature and mature eimeripain were detected in the cytoplasm of 
 micro- and macro - gametocytes and zygotes , but expression became weak in zoites forming 
 oocysts . 
 collectively , our findings suggest that eimeripain might play a key role in the 
 differentiation of intracellular zoites in the ceca and could be an interesting candidate 
 to develop a novel , effective anti - coccidian drug .",306
"life of the human being is intertwined with many changes and transformation from the clotting of the semen to the death and is divided into different stages according to specific criteria . , adolescents expand their eligibility bases , and gradually the responsibility of health care would be relegated to them by the parents . furthermore , the peers individuals have a more important role for the adolescents compared with the childhood period . the peers group provides a strong support for the adolescent and creates a sense of belongingness and power in them . therefore , it has an intense effect on the behavior and performance of the adolescents . the occurrence of an acute disease in this period leads to the creation of disturbance in the natural perfection process in the adolescence period . among these acute diseases , asthma is the most common disease in childhood , which is considered as the forerunner of acute diseases and simply can cause disability among the children . this disease is an important reason for the children 's absence from the school due to admission into the hospitals . the prevalence of children 's asthma all over the world is increasing due to numerous stressful factors , despite noticeable progressions in the field of disease controlling and access to different medications for its treatment . it can be envisaged as an epidemic disease , which has major effects on the health and the economical conditions of the society . the prevalence of this disease during the last few decades in the united states has been 16% among the children under 5 years old and nearly 74% among the adults . the percentage of the students with asthma in iran has been estimated as 10% . in recent years , due to various life problems in iran and the increased stress rate , the disease of asthma has been increased in the country like in most other societies . considering the high prevalence rate of this disease , training is one of the important methods for promoting the hygiene and health of the students through conducting different training projects by relying on their participation in different hygienic activities . moreover , caring through holding the training programs for the peer adolescents with acute diseases is one of the effective measures in order to train , empower , and cultivate the willpower in adolescents and also can help to change the risk - taking behaviors and decrease the side effects . recent conducted studies have shown the effectiveness of training peers in decreasing the side effects of the acute diseases e.g. choudhury et al . in 2009 investigated the effect of training the peers in preventing side effects of the cardiovascular diseases resulting from type ii diabetes . in addition , another study , which was conducted by mahat et al . in 2008 in new jersey , titles the effect of training peer adolescents who are susceptible to risk - taking sexual behaviors and preventing aids ; the findings indicated an obvious increase in decreasing these types of behaviors among the adolescents . since it is the most common reason for the frequent hospitalizations and school absence due to lack of information about the intensity of the disease and due to treatment among the asthmatic students and the peers of the adolescents with this disease can assist them better at the time of asthma attack because of having the possibility for an easy availability and a better trainability from the peer group and consequently decrease the incidence of side effects ; therefore , this study aimed to assess the effect of conducting training programs for high school students on the performance of the peers with asthma . this study was of a quase - experimental kind , conducted before and after intervention . the instruments for gathering information the questionnaire contain 5 demographic items , 14 knowledge measurement items , and a performance measurement checklist with 14 questions . having obtained necessary letters of permission from isfahan education organization , district 3 , those high schools in which students with asthma were being taught were selected . then , two female high schools , one for test group and the other for control group were chosen after convincing high school principals and achieving letters of consent from those students willing to participate ; 40 second - grade high school students were easily included in the study in each high school . the knowledge questionnaire and performance checklist developed by the researcher were presented to some professors of and specialists on asthma and allergy , and statistics advisors to decide their validity and the necessary amendments were made after collecting ideas and suggestions . in order to calculate reliability , the researcher , during a pilot study , presented the knowledge measurement to 10 qualified people , who were not going to be included by the study to fill them out . furthermore , the researcher , through an oral interview , tried to completed performance checklist and measured knowledge questionnaires and performance checklists cronbach as 87% and 89% , respectively . having homogenized the two groups demographically , the pre - test was conducted , and knowledge questionnaire was answered by the two groups measure performance , and through simulating an asthma attack , the researcher completed related checklist by observing activate of peers during attack . having examined pre - test results and determined the matters required for education , the training intervention for test group was conducted by the researcher through lecturing , group discussion , collective methods , and activating accompanied by questioning . the members of test group were firstly divided into two equal subgroups , and training program ( four 60-minute training sessions held at 9 - 10 and 10 - 11 am ) was performed for both subgroups while high school personnel were acting as coordinators . during first session , different types of illness and its clinical symptoms were presented via lecture and questioning after acquainting students with asthma definition . during second session , the content of the first session was firstly gone through , and some questions about first session 's ideas were asked and students replied while discussing in 5-member circle . then , content of the second session , including asthma attack reasons and its preventive methods , were offended by giving lecture and questioning . as the third session started , questioning and group discussion were adopted , and it was followed by presenting this session 's content including athletic asthma and its preventing methods . training of required activities and assistance in case of attack was presented to students providing individual students with mdi devices simultaneously , showing the pictures through powerpoint , and imitating by the researcher herself . furthermore , the indirect training was offered during fourth session and through presenting researcher - developed booklets . after a one - month break following the last training session , knowledge questionnaires and performance checklists were again filled out by both the groups , and the data was analyzed by spss 16 software . the t - paired test , independent - t test , mann - whitney test , and dependent - t test were utilized for comparing examined variables before and one month after intervention in both test subgroups , the scores average between the two subgroups at one point in time educational level and people 's age average in both subgroups , respectively . statistically p was held significant at < 0.05 . the average of an age was 16 in both groups examined in this study , and there was no difference between two groups . 82.5% of fathers of students in both groups had under diploma education , 5% of them in test group and 5 - 7% of them in control group enjoyed academic education , and the two groups were not statistically different ( p = 0.95 ) . furthermore , 87.5% of test group 's mothers and 75% of control group 's mothers had under diploma studies ; besides 0% of test groups mothers and 5% of control groups therefore , there was no significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.13 ) . the occupation of a large portion of fathers and mothers of the two group 's members was self - employed and housewife , respectively the comparison of peoples knowledge and performance scores average , before and one month after training for both groups , is presented in the following table , showing there is no significant difference between the scores before and one month after training in control group . however , the difference is significant in test group ( p < 0.001 ) . as observed in [ table 1 ] , the average of knowledge and performance scores of the two groups have no significant difference , but the given difference will grow significant after training ( p < 0.001 ) . the comparison of mean of examined variables scores of test and group before and after training the results indicated that the amount of knowledge of peers of those students suffering from asthma would grow significantly after performing training intervention . the results of a study by pit erg et al . , aiming at examining the effect of training of peers of students with asthma , indicated that the mean of student 's knowledge scores of test group increased significantly one month after training intervention . the peers of students with asthma could assist them during attacks regarding study 's results , helping the patient and family 's fear and stress device , and consequently prevent from creating difficulties facing learning process and incurring high expenses for treatment . in a study by smith et al . , on training the peers of students with asthma , the level of knowledge and attitude of students in test group increased after training intervention compared to control group . in addition , the attitude level of students in test group showed a significant difference compared to before intervention , confirming the present study 's findings and showing its ability to increase students knowledge on asthma . 's study on training risky behaviors to adolescents peers predisposed to aids has reported similar findings , indicating that the training peers of students with chronic illnesses could consequently preventing from heightening their conditions . the results of piggy et al . , study conducted in the u.s . , have reported similar findings in case of diabetes . have also reported that training of the peers of those students suffering from diabetes helped their athletic performance improve . in another study by nazar et al . , entitled an examination of training effect on student 's nutritional behaviors , it was found that the amount of knowledge and nutritional performance of students had improved significantly after training . in a study by frail et al . , on performance of students with obesity , a significant difference was found in students behaviors and selection level of foods and meals after performing training program compared to before it . , in a study aimed at examining the effect of training peers of adolescents , predisposed to sexual risky behaviors in zambia , found that the knowledge of test group students on using condom in prevention aids increased one month after training . moreover , test group students attitude on using preventive instruments in order to prevent aids increased while no difference was observed in control group . kirby et al . , in their systematic examination , have reported in effectiveness of schools curricula and peers training on prevention from hiv . in a study on assessment of peers training effect on adolescents regarding aids preventing behaviors and sexual illness in cameroon , found that there is a significant correlation between training by peers and knowledge enhancement in the case of new control aptiva methods and sexual illness symptoms . the results of mohammadzadeh et al . showed that the mean knowledge score of teachers was ( 12  2.3 ) . this means that the mean knowledge score was intermediate . because of adolescents tendency toward peers and creating popularity in group , its consequent social support produced by this group , training student , in particular by peers of students with chronic illnesses , could prevent from stress and depression among affected students and be some strategy to enhance their health . since the trainings were offered during student 's classes , there was some interruption between class hours and training time ; the researcher could decrease the limitation greatly in collaboration with high school principle . the average of an age was 16 in both groups examined in this study , and there was no difference between two groups . 82.5% of fathers of students in both groups had under diploma education , 5% of them in test group and 5 - 7% of them in control group enjoyed academic education , and the two groups were not statistically different ( p = 0.95 ) . furthermore , 87.5% of test group 's mothers and 75% of control group 's mothers had under diploma studies ;

"obestatin is a 23-amino acid peptide derived from proghrelin , a common prohormone for ghrelin and obestatin . obestatin , like ghrelin , was originally extracted from rat stomach , and the stomach seems to be a major source of circulating obestatin . secretion of obestatin is pulsatile , and plasma obestatin level exhibits an ultradian pulsatility with a frequency slightly lower than octanoylated ghrelin and growth hormone . synthesis and release of ghrelin in the stomach is related to gastric condition . in patients with helicobacter pylori - evoked antral gastritis , plasma concentration of ghrelin and gastric expression of mrna for ghrelin are increased ; whereas in the next stage of helicobacter pylori infection , in chronic atrophic gastritis , level of ghrelin is reduced . previous studies have shown that administration of ghrelin protects various organs such as the heart , kidney   and brain   against ischemic injury and attenuates sepsis - induced lung injury and mortality . moreover , ghrelin affects the bone metabolism , stimulating osteogenesis and improving the repair of bone defects . in the gut , pretreatment with ghrelin reduces gastric mucosal damage induced by noxious agents [ 1113 ] and inhibits the development of acute experimental pancreatitis . moreover , apart from its protective effect , ghrelin accelerates the healing of gastric ulcers   and exhibits a therapeutic effect in the course of acute pancreatitis   and colonic inflammation . obestatin promotes survival of pancreatic islets , and pretreatment with obestatin inhibits the development of cerulein - induced acute pancreatitis . tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- ) and interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) are cytokines involved in systemic inflammation and are members of a group of cytokines that stimulate acute phase reaction . tnf- and il-1 are produced mainly by macrophages , but a broad variety of other cell types is also involved in their production . therefore , the aim of our present investigation was to examine whether obestatin administration exhibits any effect on the healing of chronic gastric ulcers and whether obestatin affects mucosal expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines . studies were performed on 80 male wistar rats weighing 180200 g and divided randomly into 8 groups . experiments were conducted following the experimental protocol approved by the local commission of ethics for the care and use of laboratory animals . animals were housed in cages with wire mesh bottoms , in normal room temperature ( 221c ) and a 12-h light - dark cycle . after fasting for 16 h , rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital ( 30 mg / kg i.p . , vetbutal , biowet , puawy , poland ) and chronic gastric ulcers were induced using our modification   of a method originally described by okabe et al . briefly , a plastic tube of 4.2 mm inner diameter was applied tightly to the serosal surface of the anterior wall of the distal portion of the stomach , proximal to the pylorus . about 70 l of 100% acetic acid was applied through this tube for 20 s. after removal of the acetic acid , the abdomen was closed by sutures . this method was found to result in the formation of chronic ulceration of mucosa and submucosa within the area of acetic acid application . all rats were fasted with unlimited access to water at day 0 and then had free access to food and water . after induction of ulcers or sham operation , rats were treated with saline ( 0.9% solution of nacl ) or obestatin given intraperitoneally twice a day for 6 days ( the first injection at the day of ulcer induction , the last injection 1 h before the end of experiment ) . obestatin was administered at the dose of 4 , 8 or 16 nmol / kg / dose . rat obestatin was synthesized at the yanaihara institute by a solid phase methodology with fmoc strategy using an automated peptide synthesizer ( applied biosystem 9030 pioneer , foster , ca , usa ) . six days after induction of chronic gastric ulcers , rats were anesthetized again with pentobarbital and the abdomen was opened by a midline incision . the stomach was exposed and the gastric mucosal blood flow was measured using laser doppler flowmeter ( periflux 4001 master monitor , perimed ab , jrflla , sweden ) . blood flow was measured in 5 areas of gastric mucosa and mean value of 5 recordings was presented as percent of mucosal blood flow recorded in saline - treated control rats without induction of ulcers . after measurement of mucosal blood flow the area of ulcerated mucosa was measured using a computerized planimeter ( morphomat , carl zeiss , berlin , germany ) as described previously . expression of mrna for interleukin-1 and tnf- was determined using reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) as described previously . samples of gastric mucosa were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80c until rna extraction . the interleukin-1 primer sequences were : sense , gctacctatgtcttgcccgt , and antisense , gaccattgctgtttcctagg ; the expected length of the product was 543 bp . the tnf- primer sequences were : sense , tactgaacttcggggtgattggtcc , and antisense , cagccttgtcccttgaagagaacc ; the expected length of the product was 295 bp . the -actin primer sequences were : sense , ttgtaaccaactgggacgatatgg , and antisense , gatcttgatcttcatggtgctagg ;

whereas effect of obestatin given at the dose of 4 nmol / kg was statistically insignificant . in control saline - treated animals , gastric mucosal dna synthesis reached a value of 75.22.8 dpm/g dna ( figure 3 ) . administration of obestatin failed to affect dna synthesis in gastric mucosa in rats without induction of ulcers . in saline - treated rats with ulcers , gastric mucosal dna synthesis was reduced by 42% . treatment with obestatin partly reversed the ulcer - evoked reduction in dna synthesis in gastric mucosa . this effect was statistically significant after obestatin was administered at the dose of 8 or 16 nmol / kg / dose . in rats with intact gastric mucosa , administration of obestatin at the dose of 8 nmol / kg / dose was without effect on mucosal expression of mrna for pro - inflammatory il-1 in the stomach ( figure 4 ) . administration of obestatin at the dose of 8 nmol / kg / dose partly , but significantly , reversed the ulcer - evoked increase in mucosal expression of mrna for interleukin-1. administration of obestatin at the dose of 8 nmol / kg / dose was without effect on the ratio of mrna for tnf- to mrna for -actin in gastric mucosa in rats without induction of ulcers ( figure 5 ) . treatment with obestatin at the dose 8 nmol / kg / dose reduced the ulcer - evoked increase in expression of tnf- mrna by 61% , but this value was still higher than that observed in control rats with intact mucosa . our present study has shown for the first time that obestatin exhibits therapeutic effect in the course of chronic gastric ulcers . this effect was related to a decrease in local inflammatory process , improvement of mucosal blood flow and enhancement of mucosal cell proliferation , leading to acceleration of gastric ulcer healing . direct mechanism of obestatin s therapeutic effect is not clear because the cellular target of this peptide is uncertain . initially , zhang et al reported that obestatin binds and activates the orphan g protein - coupled receptor gpr39 . on the other hand , numerous researchers have obtained opposite results . chartrel et al .   found no specific binding of i - obestatin to grp39 receptor , and they observed no effects of obestatin on gpr39-transfected cells in various functional assays , using the same experimental conditions as zhang et al . similar negative results were also observed by lauwers et al .   and holst . facing the problem of inconsistent result , zhang et al . have performed a new , precise study , investigating target cells for obestatin based on induction of an early - response gene c - fos in different tissues . after administration of obestatin , c - fos staining was found in the nuclei of gastric and intestinal mucosa , white adipose tissues , hepatic cords , and kidney tubules . binding studies , using jejunum homogenates and recombinant gpr39 , revealed obestatin - specific displacement curves . furthermore , zhang et al .   demonstrated that treatment with obestatin induces c - fos expression in gastric mucosa of wild - type , but not gpr39 null , mice , indicating a mediating role of this receptor in obestatin actions . finally , zhang et al . concluded that obestatin is a metabolic hormone capable of binding to gpr39 receptor to regulate the functions of diverse gastrointestinal and adipose tissues . however , future studies are needed to confirm results obtained by zhang et al . , as well as to investigate physiological and pathophysiological role of obestatin . circulation and perfusion of organs is a basic physiological process necessary to sustain oxygenation and nutrition at a cellular level . microvascular impairment of the abdominal organs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders , including peptic ulcer disease and inflammatory bowel disease . blood flow plays an important role in protection of normal gastric mucosa and in the healing of damaged mucosa . low mucosal blood flow predisposes to injury , whereas high blood flow protects against injurious agents . . development of peptic ulcer is associated with damage to blood vessels and reduction in mucosal blood flow . during ulcer healing mucosal blood flow returns to normal level . these data are in agreement with results of our present study and indicates the role of blood flow in the therapeutic effect of obestatin in the course of chronic gastric ulcer . treatment with obestatin has increased mucosal blood flow in the stomach ; this effect has been associated with reduction in gastric ulcer area . this obestatin - evoked influence on gastric blood flow seems to be an indirect effect because administration of obestatin has failed to affect gastric blood flow in animals with intact gastric mucosa . healing of gastric ulcers needs cell proliferation ; this process is required for complete regeneration of damaged mucosa . dna synthesis precedes cell division and the rate of mucosal dna synthesis is an index of mucosal cell proliferation . in our present study , obestatin failed to affect dna synthesis in gastric mucosa in rats without ulcers , but significantly reversed the ulcer - evoked reduction in this parameter . these findings indicate that the obestatin - evoked acceleration of gastric ulcer healing involves promotion of mucosal cell proliferation , but it seems to be the secondary , indirect effect . our present study has shown that induction of ulcers increases mucosal expression of mrna for il-1 and tnf-. both of these factors are cytokines involved in local and systemic inflammation , and act synergistically . they are inducers of endothelial adhesion molecules , which are essential for the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial surface prior to their migration into the tissues . il-1 and tnf- play a crucial role in the stimulation of acute phase reaction . these data , together with our observation that treatment with obestatin reverses the ulcer - induced increase in mucosal expression of mrna for il-1 and tnf- , our study has demonstrated that treatment with obestatin accelerates healing of chronic gastric ulcers and this effect is related to improvement of mucosal blood flow , increase in mucosal cell proliferation and reduction in local expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines .","summarybackgroundprevious studies have shown that administration of obestatin exhibits a protective effect in the pancreas , attenuating the development of acute pancreatitis . the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of obestatin administration on the healing of chronic gastric ulcers.material/methodschronic gastric ulcers were induced in rats by 100% acetic acid applied to the serosal surface of the gastric wall . 
 obestatin was given twice a day intraperitoneally at the dose of 4 , 8 or 16 nmol / kg / dose for 6 days . 
 six days after induction of ulcers , rats were anesthetized and the stomach was exposed for measurement of gastric blood flow and ulcer area . 
 biopsy samples from the gastric mucosa were taken for determination of mucosal dna synthesis and for measurement of gastric expression of mrna for interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf-).resultsinduction of gastric ulcers alone increased mucosal blood flow and tissue expression of mrna for tnf- and il-1 , whereas gastric mucosal dna synthesis was reduced . in rats with gastric ulcers , administration of obestatin increased gastric mucosal blood flow , accelerated the healing rate of these ulcers and partly reversed the gastric ulcer - induced reduction in gastric mucosal dna synthesis . 
 these results were associated with a reduction in gastric mucosal expression of pro - inflammatory il-1 and tnf-.conclusionstreatment with obestatin increases gastric mucosal blood flow and cell proliferation , leading to acceleration of healing of gastric ulcers . 
 these effects are associated with a reduction in mucosal expression of pro - inflammatory il-1 and tnf-.",344
"nevertheless , many people do not have adequate physical activity and sedentary lifestyle has become an important public health issue in all age groups , including adolescents . because of increasing consumption of high - calorie food , use of digital technologies , and adopting a sedentary lifestyle in older age , physical activity promotion has become more important in adolescents . nowadays , about 80% of adolescents have neither severe nor mild physical activity more than 60 min per day . many studies show that self - efficacy ( se ) is one of the major determinants of physical activity . this construct plays an important role as the predictor of exercise , and people who have more confidence about their ability show greater participation in physical activity . likewise , those who engage more in exercise programs also achieve a higher level of general se . according to bandura , se expresses one 's beliefs in his or her ability to successfully carry out a course of action . he posits that cognitive constructs such as se have a great impact on physiologically and/or psychologically demanding behaviors like physical activities . the role of se is strongest during the early stages of participation in physical activities and when this behavior is difficult to do because of some barriers such as fatigue and time constraints . se has indirect effects on behavior too , exerting its influence through goals , ideas , outcome expectations , intentions , and perceived barriers and opportunities . physical activity is a multiple behavior and its performance needs the involvement of a range of motor skills . therefore , se about physical activity reflects a range of capabilities required to achieve a final consequence . some aspects of se that play a role in initiation of physical activity may differ from other aspects of se that relate to maintenance of physical activity . according to bandura , beliefs of se on special behavior include multiple detention set of management of intellectual , emotional , motivational , and functional processes . because attention to these dimensions can be helpful in the achievement of better understanding of the relationship between se and physical activities , it is necessary to identify the relationship between different aspects of se and physical activity . mcauley and mihalko explained  task se  and  regulatory se  as the two main types of se . task se is defined as beliefs on ability to perform constituent components of a behavior or a skill . when we consider the type , intensity , duration , and frequency of physical activity , task se should be studied . barrier se is one of the most common and known aspects of regulatory se that is applied in explanation , prediction , and modification of physical activity . other aspects of regulatory se like goal setting efficacy , scheduling efficacy , relapse prevention efficacy , asking efficacy , and environmental change efficacy have already been studied . it seems that different aspects of regulatory se have more importance in promoting participation in physical activity in public health issues . se reflects confidence of a person to management and coordination between a set of abilities and skills , not only in countering the barrier but also in commonplace condition . this shows the importance of se in design and execution of program , besides its ability to overcome the barriers . for this reason , some researchers believe that adoption and maintenance of physical activities require the se beliefs in goal setting , designing , and implementing . maddux found that the effect of se on setting and performing a program is more fundamental than task efficacy . nevertheless , few researchers have considered barrier se and se in designing and implementation of physical activities , simultaneously . nowadays , most studies are performed by considering in addition , researchers who intend to perform cross - sectional or interventional studies on physical activities in iranian population have attempted to design , translate , or re - translate se measurement tools . however , there is no evidence of a specially designed questionnaire for measuring barrier se , program designing se , and program execution se among iranian male adolescents . because the lack of attention to different aspects of se can lead to bias in the results of studies and interventions that deal with the relationship between se and physical activities , this study aims at introducing and evaluating the psychometric properties of the se questionnaire of leisure time physical activity among iranian male adolescents , emphasizing the barrier se , program designing se , and program execution se . this study was cross - sectional in design and was conducted in isfahan in the central region of iran in 2013 . recommended sample size for confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) is at least 5 to 20 cases per parameter . comrey and lee recommended the sample sizes of 200 as fair , 300 as good , and 500 as very good for exploratory factor analysis ( efa ) . because cfa and efa were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire , the main sample was divided into two separate samples for each analysis . overall , 750 adolescents aged 1519 years were recruited , of whom 16 participants were excluded while completing the questionnaire . thus , 734 male adolescents aged 1519 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria remained and were randomly divided into sample 1 and 2 . while entering the data , it was found that the 62 questionnaires had to be excluded due to incomplete filling ( ntotal = 672 ) . the data of sample 1 ( n1 = 325 ) were used for item analysis and efa and those of sample 2 ( n2 = 347 ) for cfa . in order to increase generalizability , isfahan was divided into three regions with low , intermediate , and high socioeconomic levels , based on previous studies and expert opinions . then five high schools were selected randomly in each region , as clusters of sampling ( totally 15 high schools ) . after calculating the study sample size ( 750 ) , the allocated sample size to each high school inclusion criteria were parental consent and student assent , lack of health problem that prevented them from performing physical activities , and not being a member of a professional sport teams . data were gathered via a self - administrated questionnaire that consisted of three main parts : 
 some of main characteristics of participants , such as age and familial income ( demographic characteristics)physical activity was measured using the long - version of international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) . this questionnaire was designed in 1998 by a group of italian researchers and suggested as the international measurement of physical activity for the age range of 1569 by the world health organization ( who ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . ipaq is used to evaluate a subject 's estimated metabolic equivalent ( met ) on five domains of physical activity consisting of occupational , home and domestic , transportation , and leisure time physical activity ( ltpa ) . ipaq divides individuals into three groups of total pa : low activity ( less than 600 met - min / week ) , moderate activity ( between 600 and 3000 met - min / week ) , and severe activity ( more than 3000 met - min / week ) . the amount of ltpa is divided into three levels based on the leisure time that a person spends per week for pa : less than 60 min , 60180 min , and over 180 min assumed as low , medium , and high ltpa , respectively . reliability and validity of persian version of ipaq were verifiedthe questionnaire offered for se consisted of 13 items . content of the items and the process of selection and generation are described in the following sections . these items measured the degree of confidence of participants in their ability in overcoming barriers , goal setting , and implementation of programs about physical activity using a 5-point likert scale ( 1 = absolutely correct , 5 = absolutely incorrect ) . 
  some of main characteristics of participants , such as age and familial income ( demographic characteristics ) physical activity was measured using the long - version of international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) . this questionnaire was designed in 1998 by a group of italian researchers and suggested as the international measurement of physical activity for the age range of 1569 by the world health organization ( who ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . ipaq is used to evaluate a subject 's estimated metabolic equivalent ( met ) on five domains of physical activity consisting of occupational , home and domestic , transportation , and leisure time physical activity ( ltpa ) . ipaq divides individuals into three groups of total pa : low activity ( less than 600 met - min / week ) , moderate activity ( between 600 and 3000 met - min / week ) , and severe activity ( more than 3000 met - min / week ) . the amount of ltpa is divided into three levels based on the leisure time that a person spends per week for pa : less than 60 min , 60180 min , and over 180 min assumed as low , medium , and high ltpa , respectively . reliability and validity of persian version of ipaq were verified the questionnaire offered for se consisted of 13 items . content of the items and the process of selection and generation are described in the following sections . these items measured the degree of confidence of participants in their ability in overcoming barriers , goal setting , and implementation of programs about physical activity using a 5-point likert scale ( 1 = absolutely correct , 5 = absolutely incorrect ) . generation of the items and evaluation of psychometric properties of the questionnaire were done in a current and logical direction that included the following stages : creating the initial draft of the instrument and selection or generation of items , establishing a jury of experts for completing the qualitative review , and completing the quantitative review based on lawshe , venezizno , and hooper method . in this method , content validity ratio ( cva ) and content validity index ( cvi ) were estimated and then , reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated by efa and cfa . from the very moment of designing and/or item selection , the validity of the questionnaire was tried to be achieved . so , after review of the literature and some current questionnaires , the main aspects of se were extracted according to the characteristics of the target group . then 30 items for the evaluation of se were designed in persian on the three following domains :  overcoming barriers ,   program adjustment ,  and  implementation of programs . so , the process of translation and backward translation of these items from english into persian was performed by two independent health professionals who were fluent in both languages . to evaluate the we requested five independent health professionals to give their opinions about the  face validity  and  cultural adaptation  of the initial questionnaire . thirty items were evaluated based on criteria such as simplicity , intelligibility , relevance , and appropriateness to the target group and also absence of ambiguity . at this stage , content validity was primarily evaluated by an expert panel that consisted of 10 health educators . they were asked about some of the qualitative characteristics of items , such as compliance to principles of grammar , wording , item allocation , and scaling . according to lawshe 's method , the minimum acceptable cut - off for cvr was 0.62 . based on related equation , in addition to quantitative evaluation of cvr , propositions for reform were requested from experts for each item that was selected as an unnecessary item . cultural and linguistic characteristics of iranian population are the main criteria for item evaluation . according to lynn 's method , simplicity , clarity , and specificity were considered to calculate cvi . since 0.79 was selected as the criterion for acceptable cvi , all the 13 items had the efficient criterion for remaining in the questionnaire . prior to the pilot study , comprehensibility of the questionnaire was evaluated through the opinions of 35 adolescent boys , none of whom was a member of either sample 1 or sample 2 . they stated their opinions about each item via a likert scale that consisted of the options ,  quite understandable , the number of selected options of  quite understandable  and  understandable  was divided by 35 and comprehensibility coefficient of each item was calculated . acceptable criterion for comprehensibility of each item was equal to or greater than 0.79 and all items met this criterion . finally , for estimation of reliability of the questionnaire ,  internal consistency  and  test retest  methods were used . in a pilot study , the questionnaires were given to 73 members of the target group who were not from the study population . they completed the questionnaire 2 weeks prior to the study , and then cronbach 's alpha coefficient of the first survey and pearson correlation coefficient between both surveys were calculated . we considered cronbach 's alpha coefficient and correlation coefficient equal to or greater than 0.70 as satisfactory . a total of 62 students participated in the second survey and pearson correlation coefficient between test and retest showed a strong correlation between se score in the first and second steps ( r = 0.73 , n = 62 , p < 0.005 ) .  item analysis was performed for the evaluation of reliability of the questionnaire and its items on sample 1 ( n1 = 325 ) . so ,  inter - item correlation ,   item total correlation ,   variance , squared multiple correlation ,  and  cronbach 's alpha if item deleted  were evaluated for each item . if the mean score of an item greatly diverged from the total mean score of the questionnaire or its variance was near to zero , that item was deleted . in addition , we used efa to evaluate the  construct validity  of the questionnaire on sample 1 . since the suggested questionnaire consisted of three types of se , extraction step was performed by pre - assumption of  principle component analysis .  we also chose  direct oblimin  rotation because of the possibility of correlation between components . based on pre - assumption of statistical software , the amount of eigenvalue ( variance of the factor ) was determined to be equal to 1 and the number of items of rotation to establish an appropriate rotational factor was determined to be equal to 25 . recent procedure is suitable for the evaluation of some characteristics such as unidimensionality of items . so , cfa was performed on sample 2 ( n2 = 347 ) , for determination of construct validity , performed to test the fit of data to the model that was suggested by efa . in this stage , several alternative models were tested . we used amosgraphic version 20 software ( amos graphic ) with maximum likelihood estimation procedure assumption and evaluated absolute , comparative , and parsimonious fit indices . the model was considered acceptable if cmin / df was between 1 and 5 , cfi was greater than 0.8 , parsimonious comparative fit index ( pcfi ) was less than 0.6 , root mean squared error of approximation ( rmsea ) was less than 0.8 , and pclose was greater than 0.005 . fitness of model was confirmed if p value of cmin was greater than 0.05 , cmin / df was between 2 and 3 , cfi was greater than 0.9 , and pcfi was less than 0.5 . the study was started after it was approved by isfahan university of medical sciences and isfahan education organization . ethical approval was granted by the deputy of research and technology of isfahan university of medical sciences ( i d : 39147 , date : december 30 , 2012 ) . the purpose and procedures of the study were explained to the participants , and researcher emphasized on the confidentiality of the data and voluntary nature of participation . this study was cross - sectional in design and was conducted in isfahan in the central region of iran in 2013 . recommended sample size for confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) is at least 5 to 20 cases per parameter . comrey and lee recommended the sample sizes of 200 as fair , 300 as good , and 500 as very good for exploratory factor analysis ( efa ) . because cfa and efa were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire , the main sample was divided into two separate samples for each analysis . overall , 750 adolescents aged 1519 years were recruited , of whom 16 participants were excluded while completing the questionnaire . thus , 734 male adolescents aged 1519 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria remained and were randomly divided into sample 1 and 2 . while entering the data , it was found that the 62 questionnaires had to be excluded due to incomplete filling ( ntotal = 672 ) . the data of sample 1 ( n1 = 325 ) were used for item analysis and efa and those of sample 2 ( n2 = 347 ) for cfa . in order to increase generalizability , isfahan was divided into three regions with low , intermediate , and high socioeconomic levels , based on previous studies and expert opinions . then five high schools were selected randomly in each region , as clusters of sampling ( totally 15 high schools ) . after calculating the study sample size ( 750 ) , the allocated sample size to each high school inclusion criteria were parental consent and student assent , lack of health problem that prevented them from performing physical activities , and not being a member of a professional sport teams . data were gathered via a self -

  some of main characteristics of participants , such as age and familial income ( demographic characteristics ) physical activity was measured using the long - version of international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) . this questionnaire was designed in 1998 by a group of italian researchers and suggested as the international measurement of physical activity for the age range of 1569 by the world health organization ( who ) and the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . ipaq is used to evaluate a subject 's estimated metabolic equivalent ( met ) on five domains of physical activity consisting of occupational , home and domestic , transportation , and leisure time physical activity ( ltpa ) . ipaq divides individuals into three groups of total pa : low activity ( less than 600 met - min / week ) , moderate activity ( between 600 and 3000 met - min / week ) , and severe activity ( more than 3000 met - min / week ) . the amount of ltpa is divided into three levels based on the leisure time that a person spends per week for pa : less than 60 min , 60180 min , and over 180 min assumed as low , medium , and high ltpa , respectively . reliability and validity of persian version of ipaq were verified the questionnaire offered for se consisted of 13 items . content of the items and the process of selection and generation are described in the following sections . these items measured the degree of confidence of participants in their ability in overcoming barriers , goal setting , and implementation of programs about physical activity using a 5-point likert scale ( 1 = absolutely correct , 5 = absolutely incorrect ) . generation of the items and evaluation of psychometric properties of the questionnaire were done in a current and logical direction that included the following stages : creating the initial draft of the instrument and selection or generation of items , establishing a jury of experts for completing the qualitative review , and completing the quantitative review based on lawshe , venezizno , and hooper method . in this method , content validity ratio ( cva ) and content validity index ( cvi ) were estimated and then , reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated by efa and cfa . from the very moment of designing and/or item selection , so , after review of the literature and some current questionnaires , the main aspects of se were extracted according to the characteristics of the target group . then 30 items for the evaluation of se were designed in persian on the three following domains :  overcoming barriers , some of these items also had already and similarly been used in previous studies . so , the process of translation and backward translation of these items from english into persian was performed by two independent health professionals who were fluent in both languages . to evaluate the we requested five independent health professionals to give their opinions about the  face validity  and  cultural adaptation  of the initial questionnaire . thirty items were evaluated based on criteria such as simplicity , intelligibility , relevance , and appropriateness to the target group and also absence of ambiguity . at this stage , eight items were revised and changed in wordage and 10 items were deleted . content validity was primarily evaluated by an expert panel that consisted of 10 health educators . they were asked about some of the qualitative characteristics of items , such as compliance to principles of grammar , wording , item allocation , and scaling . according to lawshe 's method , the minimum acceptable cut - off for cvr was 0.62 . based on related equation , in addition to quantitative evaluation of cvr , propositions for reform were requested from experts for each item that was selected as an unnecessary item . cultural and linguistic characteristics of iranian population are the main criteria for item evaluation . according to lynn 's method , simplicity , clarity , and specificity were considered to calculate cvi . since 0.79 was selected as the criterion for acceptable cvi , all the 13 items had the efficient criterion for remaining in the questionnaire . prior to the pilot study , comprehensibility of the questionnaire was evaluated through the opinions of 35 adolescent boys , none of whom was a member of either sample 1 or sample 2 . they stated their opinions about each item via a likert scale that consisted of the options ,  quite understandable , the number of selected options of  quite understandable  and  understandable  was divided by 35 and comprehensibility coefficient of each item was calculated . acceptable criterion for comprehensibility of each item was equal to or greater than 0.79 and all items met this criterion . finally , for estimation of reliability of the questionnaire ,  internal consistency  and  test retest  methods were used . in a pilot study , the questionnaires were given to 73 members of the target group who were not from the study population . they completed the questionnaire 2 weeks prior to the study , and then cronbach 's alpha coefficient of the first survey and pearson correlation coefficient between both surveys were calculated . we considered cronbach 's alpha coefficient and correlation coefficient equal to or greater than 0.70 as satisfactory . a total of 62 students participated in the second survey and pearson correlation coefficient between test and retest showed a strong correlation between se score in the first and second steps ( r = 0.73 , n = 62 , p < 0.005 ) . item analysis  was performed for the evaluation of reliability of the questionnaire and its items on sample 1 ( n1 = 325 ) . so ,  inter - item correlation ,   item total correlation ,   variance , squared multiple correlation ,  and  cronbach 's alpha if item deleted  were evaluated for each item . if the mean score of an item greatly diverged from the total mean score of the questionnaire or its variance was near to zero , that item was deleted . in addition , we used efa to evaluate the  construct validity  of the questionnaire on sample 1 . since the suggested questionnaire consisted of three types of se , extraction step was performed by pre - assumption of  principle component analysis . we also chose  direct oblimin  rotation because of the possibility of correlation between components . based on pre - assumption of statistical software , the amount of eigenvalue ( variance of the factor ) was determined to be equal to 1 and the number of items of rotation to establish an appropriate rotational factor was determined to be equal to 25 . all these statistical tests were performed using spss version 20 software . today , use of cfa is common for semantic matching of questions with factors . recent procedure is suitable for the evaluation of some characteristics such as unidimensionality of items . so , cfa was performed on sample 2 ( n2 = 347 ) , for determination of construct validity , performed to test the fit of data to the model that was suggested by efa . in this stage , several alternative models were tested . we used amosgraphic version 20 software ( amos graphic ) with maximum likelihood estimation procedure assumption and evaluated absolute , comparative , and parsimonious fit indices . the model was considered acceptable if cmin / df was between 1 and 5 , cfi was greater than 0.8 , parsimonious comparative fit index ( pcfi ) was less than 0.6 , root mean squared error of approximation ( rmsea ) was less than 0.8 , and pclose was greater than 0.005 . fitness of model was confirmed if p value of cmin was greater than 0.05 , cmin / df was between 2 and 3 , cfi was greater than 0.9 , and pcfi was less than 0.5 . the study was started after it was approved by isfahan university of medical sciences and isfahan education organization . ethical approval was granted by the deputy of research and technology of isfahan university of medical sciences ( i d : 39147 , date : december 30 , 2012 ) . the purpose and procedures of the study were explained to the participants , and researcher emphasized on the confidentiality of the data and voluntary nature of participation . main characteristics of the participants including samples 1 and 2 are shown in table 1 . characteristics of male adolescents who participated in study after deletion of outliers and missing data , the average of physical activity and ltpa , based on met - min / week , was equal to 2421 ( sd = 1543 ) and 902 ( sd = 938 ) , respectively . based on the correlation matrix of sample 1 , each of the suggested items had a correlation coefficient higher than 0.4 at least with one of the other items ( p  0.005 ) . according to the results shown in table 2 , all items were suitable and there was no need to remove any item . statistics of self - efficacy questionnaire abut leisure time physical activity in iranian male adolescents the data of sample 1 were analyzed so as to extract the principal components with direct oblimin rotation . olkin ( kmo ) index was equal to 0.89 and the results of bartlett 's test of sphericity were significant at the confidence interval of 95% (  = 1544 , df = 78 , p  0.00 ) . according to the adequacy of sample volume and proportion of correlation matrix with factor analysis , the data were entered into the efa process . regarding the theoretical framework of the study and as the questionnaire consisted of three aspects of se however , principle component analysis showed two components with  eigenvalue  up to 1 . observing a point of failure after three components convinced us to examine other probable solutions . in addition , results of parallel analysis that were analyzed by monte carlo physical activity software also supported the two - component solution . based on these results performed with 13 variables , 325 participants , and 100 repeats and match assumption , only two components had eigenvalue higher than the criterion values that were appropriate with randomized data . these two components explain 51.6% of variance of se and the results of  rotated pattern matrix  are shown in table 3 . rotated component and pattern matrix with pca and direct oblimin rotation for items of self - efficacy questionnaire related to leisure time physical activity in iranian male adolescents in order to verify the construct validity of the questionnaire , fitness of several models , including 13 items , was specified and evaluated with the sample 2 using cfa . the second - order model demonstrated more acceptable indices compared to first - order model . however , only some fit indices supported the acceptable fitness of second - order model with data of sample 2 , so the model needed to be modified ( cmin = 212.50 , cmin / df = 3.32 , cfi = 0.92 , pcfi = 0.76 , rmsea = 0.082 , pclose = 0.000 ) . since all unstandardized estimated parameters were significantly different from zero at the 0.001 level ( two - tailed ) , no items were removable . it was found that addition of two parameters between error variables of items 2 and 4 and items 6 and 12 led to a decrease in chi - square . moreover , theoretical framework of the study supported the correlation between error variables of these items . so ,  corrected model  was designed via two rating reduction of degree of freedom . fitness indices approved the appropriateness of the corrected model totally ( cmin = 165.53 , cmin / df = 2.67 , cfi = 0.95 , pcfi = 0.75 , rmsea = 0.069 , pclose = 0.007 ) . results of descriptive and bivariate correlation test such as main score of se and its subconstructs are shown in table 4 . the mean , standard deviation , and reciprocal correlation between different aspects of self - efficacy and leisure time physical activity in adolescent boys based on the correlation matrix of sample 1 , each of the suggested items had a correlation coefficient higher than 0.4 at least with one of the other items ( p  0.005 ) . according to the results shown in table 2 , all items were suitable and there was no need to remove any item . the data of sample 1 were analyzed so as to extract the principal components with direct oblimin rotation . olkin ( kmo ) index was equal to 0.89 and the results of bartlett 's test of sphericity were significant at the confidence interval of

component and pattern matrix with pca and direct oblimin rotation for items of self - efficacy questionnaire related to leisure time physical activity in iranian male adolescents in order to verify the construct validity of the questionnaire , fitness of several models , including 13 items , was specified and evaluated with the sample 2 using cfa . the second - order model demonstrated more

level ( two - tailed ) , no items were removable . it was found that addition of two parameters between error variables of items 2 and 4 and items 6 and 12 led to a decrease in chi - square . adding these covariance parameters had methodological acceptance . moreover , theoretical framework of the study supported the correlation between error variables of these items . so ,  corrected model  was designed via two rating reduction of degree of freedom . fitness indices approved the appropriateness of the corrected model totally ( cmin = 165.53 , cmin / df = 2.67 , cfi = 0.95 , pcfi = 0.75 , rmsea = 0.069 , pclose = 0.007 ) . results of descriptive and bivariate correlation test such as main score of se and its subconstructs are shown in table 4 . the mean , standard deviation , and reciprocal correlation between different aspects of self - efficacy and leisure time physical activity in adolescent boys this article reports the development process and evaluation of psychometric properties of a questionnaire for the determination of se about leisure time physical activity ( selpa ) . selpa was developed to evaluate the main aspects of se among iranian male adolescents via 13 items . after item generation or translation ( first stage ) , comprehensibility of the items was evaluated ( second stage ) . the psychometric properties of selpa were evaluated in a current and logical direction , including face validity ( third stage ) , content validity ( fourth stage ) , item analysis ( fifth stage ) , and construct validity by efa ( sixth stage ) and cfa ( seventh stage ) . brons and gorow believe that review of literature , obtaining comments from experts , and targeted population are the most important steps to achieve content validity of the measurement tools . in the current study , after the literature review , recommendation of 10 health experts from the research group helped us to achieve content validity . cultural and linguistic characteristics of the target group were considered in modifying the remaining items in different aspects of se related to ltpa in all stages . in addition to expert panel , during the primary study , the members of the target group represented their recommendation about comprehensibility of the questionnaire . reliability was evaluated in three steps by internal consistency and test  retest method . in each stage , the results supported the reliability of the questionnaire . one of the main strengths of this study is that two different populations were employed for the evaluation and confirmation of construct validity of the questionnaire by efa and cfa . efa showed that two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 loaded on all 13 items significantly and explained 51.6% of the variance of se . the first factor loaded on items 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 , as we expected . these items addressed the current impediments and challenges of ltpa in iranian male adolescents that were derived from literature review and expert panel . this factor is called  barrier se  and its related items consist of obstacles such as fatigue , lack of money , lack of support , time conflict , bad weather , lack of facilities , and present other competitor entertainment . the highest correlation was related to item 12 ( 0.86 ) . this item was considered the participant 's ability in continuing physical activity even in the compacted curriculum . the lowest correlation rate was allocated to item number 11 ( 0.52 ) that is associated with lack of suitable place for physical activity . results of this study about the beliefs of adolescents about overcoming barriers may be different from those of other investigations . reported that the strongest and weakest factor loading belonged to feeling depressed and feeling physical discomfort after exercise , respectively . that investigation was conducted on iranian diabetic women and the difference in characteristics of the target groups justifies such results . the second factor loaded on items 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 . this can be attributed to the confidence of a person to his or her ability to design a program for physical activity . all the items on which factor 2 loaded were related to scheduling se . compared to other questionnaires that commonly focus on barrier se , selpa considers an important aspect of regulatory se , named  scheduling se  about physical activity in leisure time . rodgers et al . noted that considering scheduling se is essential for improving the effectiveness of interventions in physical activity . since using cfa is recommended to confirm the fitness of conceptual model suggested by efa , the research group operated this statistical analysis on a separate population . correction of the model was conducted based on modification indices by adding two covariance to the model , all fit indices shift into good fitness as noroozi 's study . results of descriptive and bivariate correlation test , such as main score of se and its subconstructs , can be considered as the evidence that target group members also perceive moderate confidence to overcome the barriers and design or operate program for physical activity [ table 4 ] . robbins et al . showed a similar result in american adolescents in 2004 and reported the perceived se score of adolescents as 34.262.5 . this result is consistent with previous researches , especially those that have posited the importance of social cognitive constructs on physical activity . for example , sriramatr et al . explained a moderate correlation between coping ( barrier ) ( r = 0.33 ) and scheduling se ( r = 0.35 ) with energy consumption via physical activity in 364 young students in thailand . kim et al . showed a moderate correlation between se and exercise in adolescents too ( r = 0.45 ) . taymoori et al . have reported the highest correlation coefficient ( r = 0.62 ) between barrier se and physical activity in iranian female adolescents . this difference can be justified by population characteristics , idiographic nature of barriers , or instruments specifications . finally , the correlation pattern supports the importance of barrier compared with scheduling se , similar to other investigations . since the availability of a specific questionnaire based on specific characteristics of the target groups is important and as all important subconstructs of se should be taken into consideration , selpa was developed for the assessment of important aspects of  self - regulatory efficacy ,  such as barrier and schedule se , in iranian male adolescents . findings support that barrier and scheduling se about physical activity can be conceptually and statistically distinguished from each other . this study supported the comprehensibility , face validity , content and construct validity , reliability , and internal consistency of selpa . however , further investigations are necessary to evaluate the reliability , concurrent validity , comprehensibility , and applicability of the questionnaire through supplementary descriptive and interventional studies . also , regression analysis is recommended to explore the predictive power of this questionnaire on physical activity . we thank those who helped us in conducting this investigation , including all involved students , teachers , and school managers . in addition , the expert panel is appreciated for revising and estimating the questionnaire 's validity and the research and technology deputy of isfahan university of medical sciences for funding this research .","background : attention to different aspects of self - efficacy leads to actual evaluation of self - efficacy about physical activity . 
 this study was carried out in order to design and determine psychometric characteristics of a questionnaire for evaluation of self - efficacy about leisure time physical activity ( selpa ) among iranian adolescent boys , with an emphasis on regulatory self-efficacy.materials and methods : this descriptive 
 analytic study was conducted in 734 male adolescents aged 1519 years in isfahan . 
 after item generation and item selection based on review of literature and other questionnaires , content validity index ( cvi ) and content validity ratio ( cvr ) were determined and items were modified employing the opinions of expert panel ( n = 10 ) . 
 comprehensibility of the questionnaire was determined by members of target group ( n = 35 ) . 
 exploratory factors analysis ( efa ) was operated on sample 1 ( n1 = 325 ) and confirmatory factors analysis ( cfa ) on sample 2 ( n2 = 347 ) . reliability of selpa was estimated via internal consistency method.results:according to efa , barrier self - efficacy and scheduling self - efficacy are the two main aspects of selpa with the total variance of 65% . 
 the suggested model was confirmed by cfa and all fitness indices of the corrected model were good . 
 cronbach 's alpha was totally estimated as 0.89 and for barrier and scheduling self - efficacy , it was 0.86 and 0.81 , respectively.conclusions:the results provide some evidence for acceptable validity and reliability of selpa in iranian adolescent boys 
 . however , further investigations , especially for evaluation of predictive power of the questionnaire , are necessary .",348
"turner syndrome ( ts ) is caused by partial or complete monosomy of the x chromosome . only a few cases of ts with ischemic stroke have been reported [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . in previously reported cases , various arteriopathies affecting the cerebral arteries such as fibromuscular dysplasia , hypoplasia , moyamoya syndrome , and , we report a case of ts with multiple embolic infarcts caused by a cryptogenic embolism . a 28-year - old woman with ts was referred to our hospital because of abnormal findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . she was diagnosed with ts [ karyotype : 45 , x/46 , x , + mar ] at the age of 16 years due to amenorrhea . she denied alcohol , tobacco , or drug use and had no family history of neurologic disorders . the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 180/130 mm hg and a heart rate of 89 beats / min . she was obese with a body mass index of 27.3 kg / m ( 160 cm height , 70 kg weight ) . she visited hospital due to sudden - onset severe headache with high blood pressure ( 240/140 mm hg ) . she underwent brain computed tomography and mri at the referring hospital for differential diagnosis of thunderclap headache including hypertensive intracranial hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage , arterial dissection , or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome . brain computed tomography was unremarkable , but diffusion - weighted imaging showed restricted diffusion in multiple lesions involving multiple vascular territories ( fig 1a ) . cerebral magnetic resonance angiography ( mra ) ( fig 1b ) and carotid sonography demonstrated no extracranial or intracranial arterial stenosis . laboratory tests revealed diabetes mellitus ( fasting plasma glucose 219 mg / dl , hemoglobin a1c 11.0% ) and hyperlipidemia ( low - density lipoprotein 189 mg / dl ) . transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal valvular structure and function with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction . patent foramen ovale , atrial septal aneurysm , or any aortic pathologies including aortic atheroma were not detected in transesophageal echocardiography . the results of the hypercoagulability panel , vasculitis panel , and cerebrospinal fluid examination were all negative . aspirin was administered , and medications for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and diabetes were also started . within few hours after blood pressure control , the patient was discharged from the hospital without any symptoms of stroke , and recurrence was not observed in the 2 years after discharge . cerebrovascular arteriopathies such as fibromuscular dysplasia , congenital hypoplasia , moyamoya syndrome , and premature atherosclerosis   have been shown to be causes of ischemic stroke in previous case reports . in this case furthermore , our patient showed multiple lesions in different vascular territories that were strongly suggestive of embolic stroke . atrial fibrillation ( af ) could also be considered a potential source of embolic stroke in ts , as p - wave dispersion , a potential substrate for af , is increased in ts . the classical risk factors for developing af include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and valvular disease , and these are more common in ts than in the general population . however , we could not completely exclude the possibility of paroxysmal af , as holter monitoring has a low yield for af detection ( 35% ) . other possible cardio - aortic sources of embolism include intracardiac shunts , thrombi , calcifications / vegetations in the mitral valve , or aortic atheroma plaque . we sought to identify possible cardio - aortic sources on transthoracic echocardiography , transesophageal echocardiography , and transcranial doppler shunt test ; however , all tests were negative . some case reports have described deep venous thrombosis and portal vein thrombosis in ts [ 11 , 12 ] . these factors include fibrinogen , d - dimer , factor viii , von willebrand factor , and proteins c and s . we also considered the possibility of hypercoagulability as a cause of stroke in this case ; however , levels of d - dimer , fibrinogen , protein c and s were normal . the embolic source of stroke in our patient remains unclear ; however , this is the first report of a ts patient with an embolic stroke pattern . our case suggests another possible mechanism of stroke in ts that is different from previous case reports . ischemic stroke in ts could be due to embolism as well as various cerebral arteriopathies . further investigation is needed to more fully understand the various mechanisms of ischemic stroke in ts . ischemic stroke in ts could be due to embolism as well as various cerebral arteriopathies , as documented in previous reports . further studies are needed to determine the extent of the underlying mechanisms of ischemic stroke in ts . this case report has been approved by the institutional review board of the inha university hospital .","only a few cases of turner syndrome ( ts ) with ischemic stroke have been reported . 
 various arteriopathies of the cerebral arteries , including fibromuscular dysplasia , congenital hypoplasia , moyamoya syndrome , and premature atherosclerosis have been assumed to be the cause of ischemic stroke in ts . 
 there has been no case report of a ts patient presenting with an embolic stroke pattern without any cerebral arteriopathy . a 28-year - old woman with ts 
 was referred to our hospital because of abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings . 
 she underwent brain mri at the referring hospital because she experienced sudden - onset diffuse headache . 
 diffusion - weighted imaging revealed multiple acute embolic infarcts in different vascular territories . 
 intracranial and extracranial arterial disease was not detected on cerebral magnetic resonance angiography and carotid sonography . 
 embolic source workups , including transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography , holter monitoring , and transcranial doppler shunt study , were all negative . 
 hypercoagulability and vasculitis panels were also negative .

 this is the first report of a ts patient with an embolic stroke pattern . 
 our case shows that ischemic stroke in ts could be due to embolism as well as the various cerebral arteriopathies documented in previous reports .",293
"nevertheless , they propagate the high tie technique since it allows better lymph node retrieval and therefore a more accurate tumour staging . in another review comparing the low tie with the high tie technique , lange et al . nevertheless , they favour the low tie technique since it is less invasive , also with regard to colonic innervation and motility , and it would be beneficial for anastomotic perfusion compared to the high tie technique . performing a high tie ( ht ) technique allows anastomotic perfusion only through the marginal artery , which may lead to a decrease in anastomotic perfusion [ 5 , 6 ] . when a low tie ( lt ) technique is performed , anastomotic perfusion is allowed not only through the marginal artery , but through the left colic artery and its ascending branch as well . this anatomical reality suggests that anastomotic perfusion is higher after low tie ; however , no evidence exists supporting this hypothesis . the aim of this study is to compare the high tie technique to the low tie technique with regard to anastomotic perfusion . patients planned for elective rectal resection for malignancy in four participating hospitals , with nine participating surgeons , were eligible for this non - randomized , prospective study . the o2c system (  oxygen to see  , lea medizin technik , giessen , germany ) is a laser doppler flowmetry system that has often been used to measure intestinal blood flow for research purposes [ 7 , 8 ] . blood flow , expressed in arbitrary units , is determined by analysing the doppler frequency shifts in laser light ( 820  nm ) reflected from moving red blood cells . the laser light is emitted into the tissue , and the backscattered light is detected with a flat probe with a measurement depth of 46  mm ( lea medizin technik , giessen , germany ) . the o2c measurement frequency is 30  hz . measurements were performed at two moments during the operation , being ( a ) right after median laparotomy and ( b ) just before construction of the anastomosis or colostomy , in case of abdominoperineal resection . the measurements were performed on the antimesenterial , serosal side of the colon segment that was to become , or was after resection ( at moment b ) , the proximal loop . for all measurements , after placement of the flat probe , the flow measurement was allowed to stabilize until a constant flow was measured . the mean of these 15 measurements was used to calculate the blood flow ratio ( bfr ) , b / a . during the measurements , the blood pressure was measured as well , and the mean arterial pressure ( map ) was calculated . the high tie technique was defined as ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery ( i m a ) at its origin . the low tie technique was defined as ligation of the superior rectal artery ( sra ) , just below the branching of the left colic artery ( fig .  1 ) . b the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in ht , leaving no flow in the inferior mesenteric artery and its branches . c the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in lt ; grey indicates the flow area of i m a after lt the vasculature of the colon . b the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in ht , leaving no flow in the inferior mesenteric artery and its branches . c the dashed line indicates the level of ligature in lt ; grey indicates the flow area of i m a after lt the bfr distribution was normalised by a logarithmic transformation and compared between the ht and lt groups by means of an unpaired t test . a ht was performed in 16 patients ( 48% ) of whom 12 ( 75% ) received a primary anastomosis . a lt was performed in 17 patients ( 52% ) of whom also 12 ( 71% ) received a primary anastomosis . in all patients receiving a primary anastomosis , nine patients ( 75% ) in the high tie group and ten patients ( 83% ) in the low tie group received a defunctioning stoma . the mean number of lymph nodes harvested in the high tie group was 11 ( range , 623 ) ; in the low tie group , 12 ( range , 633 ) ( p  =  0.35 ) . the mean number of positive lymph nodes harvested in the high tie group was 3 ( 15 ) ; in the low tie group , 4 ( 19 ) ( p  =  0.32 ) . two patients developed anastomotic leakage , one in the ht group and one in the lt group . in the ht group , no significant differences were found in the remaining baseline characteristics ( table  1 ) . table  1patient characteristics of included patientsbaseline characteristicshigh tielow tiep valuegender ( m / f)11/512/51.000age ( years)55    1761    130.363bmi ( kg / m)25    327    70.473operation1.000apr45lar1212neoadjuvant therapy0.024rt148no rt29asa score0.170i75ii86iii16cardiovascular comorbidity2 ( 13%)4 ( 24%)0.656operating time ( minutes)160 ( 100340)145 ( 45225)0.450tumour stage0.250010i44iia24iib10iiia23iiib13iiic01iv40m / f male / female , bmi body mass index ( kilograms per square meter ) , apr abdominoperineal resection , lar low anterior resection , rt radiotherapy , asa score american society of anaesthesiologists score patient characteristics of included patients m / f male / female , bmi body mass index ( kilograms per square meter ) , apr abdominoperineal resection , lar low anterior resection , rt radiotherapy , asa score american society of anaesthesiologists score the mean bfr was significantly higher in the lt group as depicted in table  2 , whereas the blood pressure during measurements was not significantly different as depicted in table  3 . table  2comparison of blood flow ratios between the ht and lt techniquesratioht / ltmean ratiostd . error of the meanp valueb / aht0.910.240.04lt1.480.32table  3map measured during the blood flow measurements at time points a and b , respectivelygroupmap a / bmeanstd . error of the meanp valuehta67.12.20.473b64.23.2lta69.84.40.075b75.72.0 comparison of blood flow ratios between the ht and lt techniques map measured during the blood flow measurements at time points a and b , respectively to date , the discussion on the matter of high tie versus low tie continues . this study focuses on the colorectal vasculature and the flow change after ht or lt . found the colonic blood flow to vastly decrease after ligation of i m a or sra , with the subsequent conclusion that this could be an unavoidable factor in the pathophysiology of colorectal anastomotic leakage . only a slightly decreased blood flow was observed at the end of the operation ( bfr 0 , 91 ) , whereas an increased blood flow was measured after lt ( bfr 1 , 48 ) . the blood flow changes occurred independently from the systemic blood pressure ( table  3 ) . these different findings may be explained by the time interval between arterial ligation and measurement . study the first measurement was performed immediately after laparotomy , and the second measurement , just before construction of the anastomosis or colostomy , i.e. at the end of the operation . therefore , the interval between ligation and measurement is much longer in this study compared to the aforementioned study . this suggests that over time , a recruitment of colonic arteries occurs , allowing recovery of blood flow . in order to study whether these blood flow changes are permanent or not , blood flow measurements in the postoperative period would be interesting . in addition , since anastomotic leakage is generally detected around the eighth postoperative day , it could provide important information on the pathophysiological processes concerning blood flow leading to al . the bfr was significantly higher after lt which means lt allows better perfusion of the proximal anastomotic loop at the end of the operation . most likely , this is due to the preservation of the left colic artery and its ascending branch . in addition to the marginal artery , these arteries allow a second pathway for blood supply and faster and/or a more extensive recruitment of colonic arteries . therefore , since good perfusion is essential for proper anastomotic healing , lt would be the preferred technique for this aspect of the high tie  low tie comparison . the average bfr after lt shows an increase in blood flow compared to the initial value at the end of the operation . this has been described before by karlicek et al .   and could be due to reactive hyperaemia as a result of colon manipulation . however , it could also be due to a variety of ischaemia reperfusion injuries ( iri ) . these injuries have been well described in animal models in which an iri leads to visible hyperaemia and decreased anastomotic strength . this response is probably also present after ht ; however , it is more outspoken after lt most likely due to preservation of the left colic artery . whether these findings have an impact on the incidence of anastomotic leakage should be evaluated by analysing the blood flow during the postoperative period or in a similar but larger study . the o2c allows non - invasive measurement of blood flow ; however , the measurements are sensitive to several variables . since it is virtually impossible to mark a spot on the colon without influencing the local blood flow or without hindering the progress of the operation , placement of the probe will be slightly variable . second , the measurements are sensitive to different pressures applied on the probe when holding it in the right position . higher pressures are likely to lead to more compressed arteries and a lower blood flow . in order to limit the influence of these variables on the outcome in addition , the blood flow ratio was calculated for which the first measurement served as a control . the use of a ratio also allowed standardizing intrinsic , patient - related differences like microangiopathy due to atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus . table  1 shows baseline characteristics to be comparable between ht and lt except for radiotherapy . this is , however , unlikely to have an effect on the blood flow in the proximal anastomotic loop since this loop is located outside the radiation field . in addition , the high tie group contained a higher number of patients with metastasized disease ( stage 4 present in 25% in the ht group vs. 0% in the low tie group ) . this difference most likely illustrates the participating surgeons having preferred to perform a high tie technique in patients with metastasized disease . when comparing high tie ligation to low tie ligation , this study shows the perfusion of the proximal loop of the anastomosis to be better after low tie ligation . considering neither of both techniques is favourable on the oncological or technical aspect , low tie ligation may be the technique of choice in patients undergoing rectum resection .","purposeboth  high tie  ( ht ) and  low tie  ( lt ) are well - known strategies in rectal surgery . 
 the aim of this study was to compare colonic perfusion after ht to colonic perfusion after lt.methodspatients undergoing rectal resection for malignancy were included . 
 colonic perfusion was measured with laser doppler flowmetry , immediately after laparotomy on the antimesenterial side of the colon segment that was to become the afferent loop ( measurement a ) . 
 this measurement was repeated after rectal resection ( measurement b ) . 
 the blood flow ratios ( b / a ) were compared between the ht group and the lt group.resultsblood flow was measured in 33 patients , 16 undergoing ht and 17 undergoing lt . 
 colonic blood flow slightly decreased in the ht group whereas the flow increased in the lt group . 
 the blood flow ratio was significantly higher in the lt group ( 1.48 vs. 0.91 ; p  =  0.04 ) , independent of the blood pressure.conclusionthis study shows the blood flow ratio to be higher in the lt group . 
 this suggests that anastomoses may benefit from better perfusion when lt is performed .",257
"positron emission tomography ( pet ) is a non - invasive imaging technique used to diagnose neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders . this method facilitates longitudinal studies of various animal models of alzheimer 's disease , cerebral ischemia , depression , epilepsy , parkinson 's disease , and schizophrenia . this compound is a radioactive analogue of glucose and altered fdg uptake indicates metabolic changes of neuronal activity in the brain . application of fdg - pet in rodents for neuroscience research may be limited by unwanted extracranial accumulation of fdg in the harderian gland . unlike humans , small laboratory rodents have harderian glands that show strong fdg uptake within the orbit near the frontal region of the brain . however , one major secretory product of the gland is porphyrin , which affects photoreception and lubrication of the eyeball . fdg uptake in the harderian gland varies greatly depending on study conditions prior to pet imaging such as the use of anesthesia during the uptake period . moreover , other radioactive tracers like c - pib and f - fallypride reportedly accumulate in the harderian gland as well . this characteristic of the harderian gland makes it difficult to obtain exact measurements of fdg uptake near the frontal brain region because it is impossible to account for the radioactive spillover coming from the adjacent harderian gland . to resolve these problems , surgical procedures for harderian adenectomy ( ha ) since the mouse brain is significantly smaller compared to rat brain , the additive effect of the harderian gland on fdg uptake measurement is much greater . the purposes of the present study were to develop a surgical procedure for ha in mice and to assess the effectiveness of this procedure for improving fdg - pet . adult balb / c mice ( 22.0  1.9 g ; orientbio , korea ) were used for all experiments . two mice were used for unilateral ha , and six mice underwent bilateral ha and control operations , respectively . the experimental procedure was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of konkuk university , korea . ha was performed in mice anesthetized intraperitoneally with zoletil ( 90 mg / kg ; virbac , france ) and xylazine ( 10 mg / kg ; bayer , germany ) . the whiskers were clipped , and then the conjunctival sac and periocular skin were disinfected with povidone - iodine diluted ( 1 : 50 ) in saline . mice were placed in a lateral recumbent position and the nictitating membrane was pulled toward the lateral canthus using serrated micro - dissecting forceps ( fig . at the base of the nictitating membrane , the medially protruding , cream - colored harderian gland could be seen under the thin conjunctival tissue ( fig . the conjunctival tissue that covered the gland was incised using the tip of a surgical blade . once removed , the space between the eye and orbital rim was examined for residual glandular tissue . during the resection procedure , a small amount of bleeding occurred but stopped once slight pressure was applied with a cotton swab . postoperative care was immediately provided and performed once a day for the next 3 days . ophthalmic antibiotic ointment ( terramycin ; pfizer , usa ) and solcoseryl eye gel ( solcorin ; hanlim pharm , korea ) were applied for protection against infection and to lubricate the eyes . an analgesic ( ketoprofen , 5 mg / kg ; unibiotech , korea ) was also administered subcutaneously daily for 3 days . the adenectomized mice were subjected to fdg - pet scans on postoperative days 5 , 10 , 15 , and 30 . fdg ( 300 ci ; korea institute of radiological and medical sciences , korea ) was injected via the lateral tail vein while the mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane ( jw pharmaceutical , korea ) . the mice were positioned on the scanning bed , and pet was performed for 20 min in an inveon pet / ct system ( siemens healthcare , usa ) . the acquired pet emission data were reconstructed using a fourier re - binning algorithm with three span and 31 ring difference , and ordered subsets expectation maximization 2d algorithm with 16 subsets and four iterations . in order to improve the anatomical localization of fdg uptake in the brain , computed tomography ( ct ) the ct images were acquired with 70 kvp , 500 a , and 200 msec exposure times for each step ( inveon ; siemens healthcare ) . cone - beam reconstruction was performed with four down - sample factors using bilinear interpolation and shepp.logan filters as previously described . in order to demonstrate the influence of the harderian gland on fdg uptake in specific brain regions , statistical parametric mapping ( spm5 ; wellcome trust centre for neuroimaging institute of neurology , uk ) pet images were realigned to a template image so that the static bounding box could be used to tightly crop the region of interest . the template image was created from the mean image , which was realigned and provided an average representation of all images . the normalize function determines the transformation that minimizes the differences between two images by minimizing the sum of squares of intensity differences . during normalization , 16 nonlinear warping iterations and trilinear interpolation of the images were performed . to improve normalization accuracy , we used a full affine transformation and nonlinear deformations , which facilitate the correction of subtle differences between subjects . global calculation was performed using standard mean voxel values . using this method , voxels with values less than 1/8 of the overall mean value were deemed extracranial . for the statistical analysis , we defined t contrast and p value adjustments to the control associated with significantly active regions and rest regions ( p < 0.005 ) . in order to compare regional standard uptake values ( suvs ) affected by ha , suv from brain regions including areas of removed harderian glands , frontal brain and the cerebellum were measured . then the changes of suvs of the regions in relation to postoperative time were statistically analyzed using one - way anova and post - hoc analysis ( prism ver . when the last pet / ct scan was completed on postoperative day 30 , a visual limb - placing test was performed to evaluate visual acuity and determine if any complication had arisen following the ha . the whisker - clipped mice were lifted by the tail over the wire bar lid of a mouse cage to a height of 20 cm and then lowered onto the lid within a second . mice with normal vision extended their forelimbs toward the lid before their noses reached it . the ha mice recovered from surgery without any postoperative complications and the incision site healed without suturing . all adenectomized mice were found to have normal visual acuity according to the visual placing test , indicating there were no surgical complications . strong fdg uptake of the harderian gland was observed in the intact side and radioactive spillover into the brain was also apparent ( fig . this result suggests that excess signals emitted from the harderian gland interfere with the net measurement of brain fdg uptake , especially in the frontal brain region . bilateral ha efficiently eliminated extracranial accumulation of fdg in the harderian gland and subsequent radioactive spillover into the brain ( fig . 3 ) . in particular , pet images of the ha mice showed more defined frontal regions of the brain than those of mice that did not undergo ha . analyses of suvs revealed significant reductions in the regions of harderian gland and frontal brain ( fig . after bilateral ha , fdg uptake in the regions of the removed harderian glands was significantly reduced starting on postoperative day 5 ( figs . the reduction in fdg uptake was approximately 55% , and the left and right harderian glands both showed similar levels of reduction . suvs for the frontal brain region decreased significantly from postoperative day 10 since harderian gland fdg accumulation was eliminated ( fig . we also measured suvs for the cerebellum and the entire brain region but no statistical differences were found ( fig . these results indicate that the effect of the harderian gland on fdg - pet analysis was limited to the frontal brain region . to localize the brain regions affected by harderian gland fdg uptake , we carried out a statistical analysis using the spm tool . we were able to obtain parametric maps for mice with intact harderian glands and the adenectomized animals . when parametric maps were overlaid on a pet template , regions that had significantly high fdg uptake ( fig . results of the spm analysis concur with those obtained for manually measured suvs ( figs . our study demonstrates that ha in mice is a simple and effective method which enables accurate measurement of fdg uptake in the frontal brain region . we found that the surgical procedure used for rat ha was equally effective in mice   although more caution is required for successful surgeries in the latter species . for instance , bleeding must be strictly controlled because blood obstructs views of the limited surgical area that is available in mice . the shape of the resected harderian glands should be carefully checked to avoid potential tearing during resection . this is because any residual harderian gland left behind may result in an inaccurate fdg uptake reading along with the additional concern that the gland will regenerate . moreover , the remaining tissue may cause inflammation that in turn could increase fdg uptake over a short - term period . the simple surgical procedure performed in our study can be carried out by non - veterinarians and should take no more than 5 min . if the surgery is successful , the animal should recover readily without any postsurgical complications including vision impairment . a limitation associated with fdg - pet scanning is known as the "" partial volume effect "" , which stems from the finite spatial resolution of the images during sampling and reconstruction . a partial volume effect can distort both the contour and signal intensity of images for an actual subject . due to the partial volume effect , small pieces of tissues that accumulate high level of fdg such as harderian glands could appear larger than the actual size and obscure images of the brain during pet imaging . interference attributed to harderian gland radioactive spillover in the rodent brain has previously been described in rats and mice . thus , the adverse effects of harderian gland fdg uptake are an unavoidable issue since anesthesia is essential for obtaining pet scans of rodents . we found that ha in mice was feasible and had the same effect as it did in rats . after ha , strong fdg uptake signals were excluded from the regions of the gland and distorted fdg - pet images were corrected . it should be pointed out that it took at least 10 days before significant differences in suvs were achieved . we were also interested in assessing the range of signal spillover in the brain due to harderian gland fdg uptake . using spm analysis , we were able to demonstrate the additive effect that the harderian gland has on measuring fdg uptake in the frontal brain region . our results support a previous finding that fdg uptake by the harderian gland results in a slight over - estimation of fdg uptake in the frontal lobe of rats . we found that the level of fdg uptake stabilized starting 10 days after the surgery and was maintained for the remainder of the study . this result suggests that the glandular tissue did not regenerate , which is important for long - term experiments . in conclusion when performed prior to pet scanning of mice brains , ha may be useful for visualizing the frontal lobe with 18f - fdg micro pet / ct imaging .","positron emission tomography ( pet ) using 2-deoxy-2-[18f ] fluoro - d - glucose ( fdg ) as a radioactive tracer is a useful technique for in vivo brain imaging . 
 however , the anatomical and physiological features of the harderian gland limit the use of fdg - pet imaging in the mouse brain . 
 the gland shows strong fdg uptake , which in turn results in distorted pet images of the frontal brain region . 
 the purpose of this study was to determine if a simple surgical procedure to remove the harderian gland prior to pet imaging of mouse brains could reduce or eliminate fdg uptake . 
 measurement of fdg uptake in unilaterally adenectomized mice showed that the radioactive signal emitted from the intact harderian gland distorts frontal brain region images . 
 spatial parametric measurement analysis demonstrated that the presence of the harderian gland could prevent accurate assessment of brain pet imaging . 
 bilateral harderian adenectomy efficiently eliminated unwanted radioactive signal spillover into the frontal brain region beginning on postoperative day 10 .

"this study was developed and approved by the steering committee of the translating research into action for diabetes ( triad ) study and conducted in one of triad 's six translational research centers , kpnc . kpnc is a group practice , prepaid health plan that provides comprehensive medical services through 17 hospitals and 23 outpatient clinics to > 3 million members located in a 14-county region in northern california ( 30% of the general population in the geographic areas covered ) . the kpnc membership closely approximates the population living in the same geographic area demographically except with respect to income : kpnc members underrepresent the very poor and the very wealthy ( 9,10 ) . upon comparison with regional birth certificates over a 14-year period , there were no meaningful differences between women who delivered at a kpnc hospital and women who delivered in the underlying region regarding age at delivery or race , except that women who delivered at a kpnc hospital were slightly less likely to be hispanic ( 25.8 vs. 32.0% ) . we used the kpnc gdm registry ( 11 ) to identify women with gdm who delivered between 1 january 1995 and 31 december 2006 . during this 12-year period , the proportion of women who had been screened for gdm with a 50-g , 1-h oral challenge test during the second trimester increased by 3% over time ( age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted proportions 92.5 [ 95% ci 92.392.7 ] in 19951997 vs. 95.7 [ 95.695.9 ] in 20042006 ) . if results were abnormal ( 1-h plasma glucose levels 7.8 mmol / l [ 140 mg / dl ] ) , this test was followed by a standard diagnostic 100-g , 3-h ogtt . we identified 14,448 pregnancies that had a diagnosis of gdm from a health provider and with plasma glucose results during the index pregnancy that met the national diabetes data group ( nddg ) criteria on the 3-h 100-g ogtt for gdm , i.e. , 2 glucose values at or exceeding the following thresholds : fasting , 105 mg / dl ; 1 h , 190 mg / dl ; 2 h , 165 mg / dl ; and 3 h , 145 mg / dl ( 12,13 ) without recognized preexisting diabetes ( 14 ) . we included only women who met the nddg criteria of gdm because , in this clinical setting , the nddg criteria were used for diagnosis of gdm until january 2007 . approximately 550 women had no diagnosis of gdm but met the nddg criteria ( equivalent to 4% of the size of our gdm cohort with a diagnosis ) ; women without a diagnosis of gdm were excluded from the analysis . for the first and second aims , the primary outcome was performance of postpartum screening for diabetes by either an fpg test alone or a 75-g , 2-h ogtt . because several weeks may elapse before glucose metabolism returns to normal in most women with gdm ( 15 ) , the american diabetes association ( 16 ) and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( 17 ) both recommend that postpartum glucose screening be performed at 6 weeks postpartum or later . we considered the postpartum screening performed only if it was done during the first year after delivery starting from 6 weeks and if the woman was not pregnant again . for the third aim , the outcome was the proportion of women identified with either ifg ( defined as an fpg 100 mg / dl but < 126 mg / dl ) or diabetes diagnosed by fpg 126 mg / dl ( 18 ) . among women who had postpartum screening , therefore , when we report on trends in postpartum conversion to diabetes , we report only on the fasting values detected by either an fpg or an ogtt . for the fourth aim , we examined the proportion of women who were identified as having pre - diabetes on the postpartum screen ( that included ifg as defined above and impaired glucose tolerance [ igt ] defined as a 2-h plasma glucose value 140 mg / dl ) or diabetes ( defined as an fpg > 126 mg / dl or a 2-h plasma glucose value 200 mg / dl ) ( 18 ) . age , gestational age at delivery , race / ethnicity , maternal body weight during the beginning of the second trimester , and gestational age at gdm diagnosis were ascertained from the computerized medical records at birth . use of insulin or glyburide during pregnancy was obtained from the pharmacy database . because we had data on body weight but not on height , a woman was considered obese if her weight was 90th percentile of the weight distribution of women of her race / ethnicity in this study population . macrosomia was defined as birth weight > 4,000 g. data on annual household income were based on census block data . education and parity were obtained by linkage with the state of california birth certificate database . because the lag time before state birth certificates became available is 3 years , we have these variables for women who delivered between 1995 and 2004 . the yearly age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted proportion of women with gdm who had postpartum glucose screening and 95% cis were calculated by the direct method , in which the age and race / ethnicity distribution of the entire study population was used as the standard . among women who had postpartum screening , the direct method was used to calculate the yearly age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates of ifg and diabetes diagnosed by fpg . predictors of postpartum screening were examined in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age , race / ethnicity , education , income , obesity , parity , gestational age at gdm diagnosis , glyburide and insulin use during pregnancy , a macrosomic infant at the index pregnancy , visits to an internal medicine or obstetrics / gynecology provider during the postpartum period , year of delivery , and medical facilities . sas ( version 9.1 ; sas institute , cary , nc ) was used for all analyses . this study was approved by the human subjects committee of the kaiser foundation research institute . the yearly age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted proportion of women with gdm who had postpartum glucose screening and 95% cis were calculated by the direct method , in which the age and race / ethnicity distribution of the entire study population was used as the standard . among women who had postpartum screening , the direct method was used to calculate the yearly age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates of ifg and diabetes diagnosed by fpg . predictors of postpartum screening were examined in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age , race / ethnicity , education , income , obesity , parity , gestational age at gdm diagnosis , glyburide and insulin use during pregnancy , a macrosomic infant at the index pregnancy , visits to an internal medicine or obstetrics / gynecology provider during the postpartum period , year of delivery , and medical facilities . sas ( version 9.1 ; sas institute , cary , nc ) was used for all analyses . this study was approved by the human subjects committee of the kaiser foundation research institute . we identified 14,448 pregnancies complicated by gdm occurring between 1995 and 2006 among kpnc members who were aged 1544 years and delivered live infants or had still births . these pregnancies occurred among 13,547 women , because 901 had more than one pregnancy during the 12-year study period . the percentage of women with gdm pregnancies who received a postpartum glucose screening test increased from 1995 ( 20.3% ) to 2006 ( 55.9% ) . between 1995 and 2006 , the age of women with gdm increased slightly ( 28.2  5.7 to 28.8  6.0 years ) and the proportion of women with gdm who were hispanic increased markedly . the race / ethnicity distributions in 1995 versus 2006 were as follows : 60.7 and 43.4% white , 14.5 and 15.4% asian , 14.1 and 24.9% hispanic , 6.7 and 6.7% african american , 2.0 and 4.4% other , and 2.0 and 5.2% unknown . changes in the demographics represent changes in the entire population with gdm , regardless of performance of diagnostic screening . after adjustment for age and race / ethnicity , the proportion of women with gdm who received a postpartum glucose screening increased steadily over time from 20.7% ( 95% ci 17.823.5 ) in women who delivered in 1995 to 53.8 ( 51.356.3 ) in women who delivered in 2006 ( fig . unadjusted characteristics of women by postpartum screening status are illustrated in table 1 . in a multiple - adjusted logistic regression model ( table 2 ) , older age , asian or hispanic race / ethnicity , higher education , at least two prior births , earlier gestational age at gdm diagnosis , use of insulin or glyburide during pregnancy , and visits to an internal medicine or obstetrics / gynecology provider during the postpartum period were independent and significant predictors of postpartum screening . obesity and higher parity were significantly associated with less frequent screening . on the basis of fpg ( either performed alone or as part of the ogtt ) , 3.5% ( n = 191 ) had diabetes and 22.0% ( n = 1,228 ) had ifg . the proportion of women with ifg postpartum remained similar over time , but the proportion of women with diabetes decreased from 19951997 to 19982000 and then leveled off ( fig . 564 were screened at postpartum , and 131 had ifg and 32 had diabetes by fpg ( age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates 24.2 [ 95% ci 20.27.8 ] and 6.1 [ 4.28.1 ] , respectively ) . among women who delivered in 20042006 , 2,381 women were screened , and 583 had ifg and 80 had diabetes by fpg ( age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates 24.3 [ 22.626.0 ] and 3.3 [ 2.64.0 ] , respectively ) . the proportion of women receiving an ogtt increased from 1995 ( 5.0% ) to 2005 ( 16.6% ) and markedly increased in 2006 ( 71.5% ) . in 2006 , kpnc instituted a nurse managed care program that included greater attention to postpartum screening guidelines . among the 600 women who underwent a 75-g ogtt in 2006 , 16 had diabetes at postpartum . diabetes was diagnosed in 4 ( 25% ) by fpg alone . of the remaining 12 women , of the 188 women who were found to have pre - diabetes ( i.e. , either ifg or igt according to the fasting or 2-h glucose values measured during the 75-g ogtt ) , only 114 ( 60% ) were diagnosed with ifg ; 74 ( 40% ) would have been classified as having normal glucose tolerance on the basis of fpg alone . therefore , 78 ( 38% ) of the 204 women with either diabetes or pre - diabetes were identified only by the 2-h glucose measurements . we identified 14,448 pregnancies complicated by gdm occurring between 1995 and 2006 among kpnc members who were aged 1544 years and delivered live infants or had still births . these pregnancies occurred among 13,547 women , because 901 had more than one pregnancy during the 12-year study period . the percentage of women with gdm pregnancies who received a postpartum glucose screening test increased from 1995 ( 20.3% ) to 2006 ( 55.9% ) . between 1995 and 2006 , the age of women with gdm increased slightly ( 28.2  5.7 to 28.8  6.0 years ) and the proportion of women with gdm who were hispanic increased markedly . the race / ethnicity distributions in 1995 versus 2006 were as follows : 60.7 and 43.4% white , 14.5 and 15.4% asian , 14.1 and 24.9% hispanic , 6.7 and 6.7% african american , 2.0 and 4.4% other , and 2.0 and 5.2% unknown . changes in the demographics represent changes in the entire population with gdm , regardless of performance of diagnostic screening . after adjustment for age and race / ethnicity , the proportion of women with gdm who received a postpartum glucose screening increased steadily over time from 20.7% ( 95% ci 17.823.5 ) in women who delivered in 1995 to 53.8 ( 51.356.3 ) in women who delivered in 2006 ( fig . unadjusted characteristics of women by postpartum screening status are illustrated in table 1 . in a multiple - adjusted logistic regression model ( table 2 ) , older age , asian or hispanic race / ethnicity , higher education , at least two prior births , earlier gestational age at gdm diagnosis , use of insulin or glyburide during pregnancy , and visits to an internal medicine or obstetrics / gynecology provider during the postpartum period were independent and significant predictors of postpartum screening . on the basis of fpg ( either performed alone or as part of the ogtt ) , 3.5% ( n = 191 ) had diabetes and 22.0% ( n = 1,228 ) had ifg . the proportion of women with ifg postpartum remained similar over time , but the proportion of women with diabetes decreased from 19951997 to 19982000 and then leveled off ( fig . 564 were screened at postpartum , and 131 had ifg and 32 had diabetes by fpg ( age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates 24.2 [ 95% ci 20.27.8 ] and 6.1 [ 4.28.1 ] , respectively ) . among women who delivered in 20042006 , 2,381 women were screened , and 583 had ifg and 80 had diabetes by fpg ( age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted rates 24.3 [ 22.626.0 ] and 3.3 [ 2.64.0 ] , respectively ) . the proportion of women receiving an ogtt increased from 1995 ( 5.0% ) to 2005 ( 16.6% ) and markedly increased in 2006 ( 71.5% ) . in 2006 , kpnc instituted a nurse managed care program that included greater attention to postpartum screening guidelines . among the 600 women who underwent a 75-g ogtt in 2006 , 16 had diabetes at postpartum . diabetes was diagnosed in 4 ( 25% ) by fpg alone . of the remaining 12 women , 8 ( 50% ) had ifg and 4 ( 25% ) had normal fpg . of the 188 women who were found to have pre - diabetes ( i.e. , either ifg or igt according to the fasting or 2-h glucose values measured during the 75-g ogtt ) , only 114 ( 60% ) were diagnosed with ifg ; 74 ( 40% ) would have been classified as having normal glucose tolerance on the basis of fpg alone . therefore , 78 ( 38% ) of the 204 women with either diabetes or pre - diabetes were identified only by the 2-h glucose measurements . in a managed care plan with a large number of women with gdm pregnancies , we found that between 1995 and 2006 , screening for postpartum diabetes increased from 20.7 to 53.8% . the increase in screening performance is not likely to be due to advancing maternal age or changes in the racial / ethnic composition of women with gdm , as this trend in screening performance was similar after adjustment for age and race / ethnicity , and almost the entire population of pregnant women was screened for gdm between 1995 and 2006 . although the proportion of women with ifg on their postpartum screen did not significantly change over time , the proportion of women with diabetes ( diagnosed by fpg levels ) at postpartum decreased by 50% . this observed decrease in diabetes among women with postpartum screening is not likely to be a consequence of the small increase ( 3% ) in gdm screening over time . the decrease is more likely because of better identification of diabetes before pregnancy , as suggested by the reported increase in postpartum screening among women with gdm and because of an increase in glucose screening in postpartum women without gdm ( 1.9% in 1995 vs. 8.2% in 2006 ) . as in other reports ( 58 ) , the majority of women in our cohort did not undergo postpartum diabetes screening in the early years of the study . it is possible that health care providers might have recommended more postpartum screening among these racial / ethnic groups , given their higher prevalence of diabetes ( 19 ) . it is also possible that asian women were more likely to have had a recent physical examination , giving the health care provider the opportunity to recommend screening , as suggested by racial / ethnic differences in access to care among gdm women ( 20 ) . similar to other reports , we found that greater contact with medical care , either through a postpartum visit or other contacts , was associated with greater postpartum screening and may have provided additional opportunities to perform screening ( 6,7 ) . women who were more likely to be screened also were older and had higher educational attainment . although reasons are speculative , these women may have had greater awareness of their diabetes risk and the recommendation for screening . in women who were screened postpartum , gdm was diagnosed earlier in their index pregnancy , and they were more likely to have been treated with medications , which may have increased their and their provider 's awareness of their diabetes risk . glucose levels on the diagnostic 3-h ogtt during pregnancy were similar in women who were and were not screened , suggesting that these were not used to guide testing . as shown by others ( 21 ) , there was a suggestion that some of the women with a history of gdm who might have had a higher risk of developing diabetes during the postpartum period , such as those who were obese or with higher parity , were less likely to perform postpartum screening . the american diabetes association ( 16 ) , the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( 17 ) , and the fifth international congress workshop for gestational diabetes ( 15 ) endorse the postpartum ogtt and fpg to different extents . if only fpg were used in postpartum screening , 74 ( 40% ) cases of igt and 16 ( 75% ) cases of diabetes would have been missed . kitzmiller et al . ( 19 ) reported that among 527 women with gdm , at postpartum 16.5% had isolated igt , only 16% of women in whom diabetes was diagnosed met the criteria for both elevated fpg and 2-h values , and 21 of 25 women met the criteria for diabetes according to their 2-h values alone . hunt and conway ( 21 ) also reported that one - third of their postpartum gdm cohort undergoing the ogtt and who had diabetes or pre - diabetes had isolated 2-h elevations . their results are very similar to those found in this study : 78 of 204 women compared with 41 of 117 ( or 38% vs. 35% ) . therefore , the greater convenience of the fpg needs to be weighed carefully against its decreased sensitivity , particularly among women with a history of gdm . we were not able to distinguish whether the lack of screening occurred because of a lack of provider order or other reasons . however , provider orders for screening might occur only after negotiation with the patient , and a lack of provider order may , at least in part , reflect women 's objections to the test . we defined obesity by using race / ethnicity - specific percentiles , rather than height - to - weight ratios , thus introducing the possibility for misclassification and artificially decreasing the association between obesity and screening to the null . information on other confounders , such as family history of diabetes , was not available from electronic records . because the population of women with gdm is of reproductive age , postpartum screening and subsequent diagnoses of diabetes affect not only the mothers but also future pregnancies . the risk of complications , particularly stillbirths and congenital abnormalities , may be reduced with optimal glycemic control before the subsequent pregnancy ( 1 ) . prepregnancy glycemic control might also reduce the risk of the infant to the in utero exposure to hyperglycemia that might lead to childhood obesity and diabetes ( 22 ) . a diagnosis of pre - diabetes would identify women at high risk of future maternal diabetes , but this risk could be reduced through the application of interventions such as thiazolidinediones , metformin , or intensive lifestyle modification ( 3,4 ) . we conclude that , among women with a gdm history , postpartum diabetes screening has increased , but screening is still suboptimal . performance of an fpg alone , as opposed to the ogtt , will miss a subpopulation of women at risk .","objective  the purpose of this study was to examine trends in postpartum glucose screening for women with gestational diabetes mellitus ( gdm ) , predictors of screening , trends in postpartum impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) and diabetes , and diabetes and pre - diabetes detected by postpartum fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) versus a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt).research design and methods  this was a cohort study of 14,448 gdm pregnancies delivered between 1995 and 2006 . 
 postpartum screening was defined as performance of either an fpg or ogtt at least 6 weeks after delivery and within 1 year of delivery.resultsbetween 1995 and 2006 , the age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted proportion of women who were screened postpartum rose from 20.7% ( 95% ci 17.823.5 ) to 53.8% ( 51.356.3 ) . 
 older age , asian or hispanic race / ethnicity , higher education , earlier gdm diagnosis , use of diabetes medications during pregnancy , and more provider contacts after delivery were independent predictors of postpartum screening . obesity and higher parity 
 were independently associated with lower screening performance . among women who had postpartum screening , 
 the age- and race / ethnicity - adjusted proportion of ifg did not change over time ( 24.2 [ 95% ci 20.027.8 ] in 19951997 to 24.3 [ 22.626.0 ] in 20042006 ) , but the proportion of women with diabetes decreased from 6.1 ( 95% ci 4.28.1 ) in 19951997 to 3.3 ( 2.64.0 ) in 20042006 . among women who received an ogtt in 2006 , 
 38% of the 204 women with either diabetes or pre - diabetes were identified only by the 2-h glucose measurements.conclusionspostpartum screening has increased over the last decade , but it is still suboptimal . 
 compared with fpgs alone , the 2-h values identify a higher proportion of women with diabetes or pre - diabetes amenable to intervention .",447
"physical activity during preschool age has significant effects on physical , social and psychological health of children . fundamental movement skills ( fms ) including locomotor ( e.g. run , gallop , hop , leap , horizontal jump and slid ) , object control ( e.g. catch , kick , overhand throw and dribble ) and body management ( e.g. balance , climb and forward roll ) provide a base for more advanced physical skills . fms develop during early childhood and are essential for complex activities at adulthood . some studies have shown that the level of locomotor skills of children is positively correlated with the levels of participation in physical activities at adulthood[34 ] . d'hondt et al reported that the levels of gross motor skills in obese children are lower than the levels of these skills in normal - weight children . therefore it seems likely that more proficient children in fms are more physically active , have more self confidence , are less obese and would be healthier in their adulthood . fms would not be developed naturally as a result of growth and maturation in all children . it has been suggested that the optimal ages for fms learning are between 2 to 7 years[2 , 6 ] . brian w et al have recommended that physical activity promotional programs for preschool children should be on base of children 's natural activities such as being spontaneous and intermittent . also preschool children activities should be enjoyable and contain gross motor plays and locomotor activities . therefore , it seems that an effective physical activity program for preschool children needs to be developmentally appropriate for children in the listed age range . furthermore , physical , emotional and psychosocial needs of children should be considered in development of appropriate physical activity program for these children . ideally physical activity programs in nursery schools also a well developed training course for these instructors is essential in efficient teaching of movement skills to children in nursery schools[1 , 9 ] . in addition to the role of fms in long - term health , fms play a cardinal role in physical development of preschool children . to our knowledge there is no national curriculum for preschool children physical activity education in iranian nursery schools . the objectives of this study were a ) to develop a physical activity program for nursery schools in iran , and b ) to evaluate the effects of this program on improvement of fundamental movement skills of preschool children in selected nursery schools in iran . this quasi - experimental study evaluated the effect of a 10 weeks physical activity program on fundamental movement skills levels of nursery children in iran . the participants were 147 children with age range between 4 to 6 years that were selected by convenience sampling . children selected form five available nursery schools in five different cities in iran . a manual for nursery physical activity instructors was developed by a panel of 20 experts in different related fields in iran including sports medicine specialist , pediatrician , expert nursery teachers , psychologist , nutritionist , physical education specialist , phd in sports physiology , and phd in movement and behavior . this manual contained two parts ; a ) instructions for nursery physical activity instructors about goals and structure of the program , and materials on children 's growth and development , children 's nutrition , physical education , psychology of children , and health and safety , b ) twenty four sections which cover different lessens containing physical activity and games aimed at developing locomotor and object control skills of children aged 4 to 6 years . some sections of this package were developed based on the iranian traditional games and plays that were appropriate for preschool ages . five nursery schools were selected in five different cities ( tehran , isfahan , shahrood , neishaboor and gorgan ) and volunteer nursery teachers of these nursery schools were enrolled in an educational course . this one week course was designed to train nursery physical activity instructors to be able to physically train children in nursery based on our designed physical activity program . the aim of this short - term educational program was to ensure that all physical activity instructors are alert to their duties about implementing of the developed physical activity manual . also physical activity instructors were educated to test children using the test of gross motor development - edition 2 ( tgmd-2 ) before and after intervention . persian version of this test has been employed by akbari h , et al . and bakhtiari s , et al . in iran[9 , the levels of gross motor development of all subjects were measured before intervention and after 10 weeks physical activity program employing tgmd-2 . tgmd-2 is a valid and reliable ( test - retest reliability = 0.88 - 0.96 ) criterion - referenced instrument designed to assess gross motor development among children . each subtest consists of 6 locomotor items ( run , hop , gallop , leap , horizontal jump , and slide ) , and 6 object control items ( throw , catch , kick , strike , dribble , and roll ) . subtest raw score was defined by sum of 6 items of each subtests of locomotor or object control ( scored between 0 - 48 ) . standard scores of each subtest ( scored between 0 - 20 ) and also gross motor quotient were calculated in accordance with tgmd-2 manual . ( gmq ) for each subject was reported as very superior ( gmq > 130 ) , superior ( gmq = 121130 ) , above average ( gmq = 111120 ) , average ( gmq = 90110 ) , below average ( gmq = 8089 ) , poor ( gmq = 7079 ) , and very poor ( gmq < 70 ) according to the suggestions of the tgmd-2 manual . according to developed physical activity manual , physical activity program was conducted 5 days a week for 10 weeks by trained nursery physical activity instructors . paired - samples t test was used to determine whether there were significant differences between the levels of locomotor and object control of participants before and after intervention . independent samples t - test was used to compare differences between boys and girls on variables . in this quasi - experimental study 147 children with mean ( sd ) age of 4.95 ( 0.8 ) ( range 3 - 6 ) year from five nursery schools in 5 cities in iran were included . of all subjects 49% ( 72 ) were girls and 51% ( 75 ) were boys . the base line and post intervention tgmd-2 scores of subjects are presented in tables 1 and 2 . in the baseline , there were no statistically significant differences between the locomotor and object control raw scores of boys and girls ( p=0.49 and p=0.9 ) respectively . base line and post intervention tgmd-2 scores of all subjects sd : standard deviation means ( sd ) of base line and after intervention tgmd-2 raw scores of all subjects by age and gender sd : standard deviation after intervention , differences between the locomotor raw scores of boys and girls were not statistically significant ( p=0.5 ) . however , there was a statistically significant difference between boys and girls in the object control raw scores ( p=0.048 ) . the gmq of all subjects which is the most reliable score of tgmd-2 was statistically significantly increased after 10 weeks of intervention . both subtests of tgmd-2 including  locomotor raw score  and  object control raw score  in both genders were statistically significantly increased after 10 weeks of intervention ( table 1 ) . descriptive rating of gmq for subjects before and after intervention is shown in table 3 . before intervention only 11.5% of all subjects were rated superior / very superior in gmq scores ( i.e. gmq > 120 ) , however this rate increased to 49.7% of all subjects after 10 weeks of intervention . before the intervention , 26.6% of all subjects were rated as poor / very poor , this rate decreased to 2% of subjects after 10 weeks intervention . age equivalents of subjects on the locomotor and object control subtests before and after intervention are shown in table 4 . age equivalents or developmental age defined as  developmental level or age that corresponds to a raw score made by an individual  . descriptive rating of the gross motor quotient of all subjects before and after intervention age equivalents for locomotor and object control raw scores according to age groups of all subjects before and after intervention the main finding of this study was that the developed physical activity intervention program that was focused on gross motor skills development had a significant positive effect on proficiency in fundamental movement skills in preschool children from selected nursery schools in five cities in iran . differences in tgmd-2 results before and after the intervention were significant in locomotor , object control , sum of standard cores and gross motor quotient in all subjects . to our knowledge there has been no published data on the levels of physical activity of iranian preschool children . however , base line tgmd-2 subtests scores of our subjects in this study were in the range of reported data from the united states ( table 5 ) . comparison of tgmd-2 standard scores of subjects in this study with reported data from the united states , mean ( sd ) sd : standard deviation our data suggested that a supervised physical activity program could increase these scores to be better than normative reported data . there was no significant difference in the base line mean of the locomotor and object control raw scores between girls and boys ( 30 vs 29.5 ) and ( 24.8 vs 26 ) , respectively . however after the intervention the mean of both object control raw scores ( p=0.048 ) and object control standard scores ( p=0.02 ) in girls were higher than these scores in boys . cliff et al have reported that locomotor raw score in preschool children was higher in girls compared with boys but there was no significant difference between girls and boys in the object control raw score . in this study , base line means of standard scores of the locomotor ( 9.3 vs 8.9 ) , object control ( 9.1 vs 8.1 ) and gmq ( 95.5 vs 91.2 ) were not significantly different between girls and boys . in contrast cliff et al have reported significant differences between girls and boys in the mean of locomotor standard scores ( 9.9 vs 7.9 ) , object control standard scores ( 10.1 vs 8.6 ) and gmq ( 99.7 vs 88.2 ) . one study has reported that locomotor skills proficiency is higher in girls and in contrast boys are more proficient in object control skills . some studies have suggested that the levels of moderate and vigorous physical activities in children with better motor performance are significantly higher than the levels of these activities in children with less developed skills[4 , 19 ] . therefore , conduction of a physical activity program such as the program used in this study may help children to improve their fms which may help to have a higher physical activity in their future . first , same person conducted both training sessions and outcomes measurement in each nursery school . furthermore , to our knowledge there was no normative data of tgmd-2 for iranian children to be used for comparison with our data . further studies are needed to evaluate the long - term effects of physical activity intervention on fms in iran . it seems that our developed physical activity program conducted by trained nursery physical activity instructors could be an effective and practical way of improving gross motor skills of preschool children in short term in iran . conduction of this program in nursery schools could indirectly help with increasing health levels and levels of physical activities in the society . we recommend using of this kind of physical activity programs in all nursery schools in iran and similar counties .","objectivethe objectives of this study were a ) to develop a physical activity program for nursery schools , and b ) to evaluate the effects of this program on fundamental movement skills of preschool age children in iran.methodsin this quasi - experimental study 147 children from five nursery schools in five different cities in iran were enrolled . 
 a physical activity program was developed for nursery children . 
 trained nursery physical activity instructors conducted the program for 10 weeks for all subjects . 
 the levels of gross motor development of all subjects were measured before intervention and after 10 weeks physical activity program employing the test of gross motor development - edition 2 ( tgmd-2).findingsthe participants in this study had a mean ( sd ) age of 4.95 ( 0.83 ) years . at the end of the study , scores of subjects at all components of tgmd-2 ( including locomotor , object control , sum of standard scores and gross motor quotient ) 
 were significantly improved compared to the baseline scores ( p<0.001 ) . 
 based on descriptive rating of the "" gross motor quotient "" in the base line , 11.5% of subjects were superior / very superior ( gmq > 120 ) and after 10 weeks intervention this rate was increased to 49.7% of all subjects.conclusionit seems that the developed physical activity program conducted by trained nursery physical activity instructors could be an effective and practical way of increasing levels of fundamental movement skills of preschool children in iran .",301
"hypophosphatemic rickets ( hr ) is a metabolic bone disorders manifested by musculoskeletal disorders specially in the lower extremities , growth retardation and dental problems[1 , 2 ] . this disorder affects all ages and both sexes and is characterized by a low concentration of serum phosphate , elevated alkaline phosphatase , normal or decreased serum calcium and inappropriate levels of 1,25-dihydroxy - vitamin d [ 1,25 ( oh)2 vit d][1 , 3 ] . musculoskeletal disorders are due to mineralization impairment of the bone matrix and teeth with different etiologies . x - linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( xlhr ) is the most common form of the genetic disorders causing rickets due to hypophosphatemia . this disorder results from mutation in the phex gene and the product of this gene has a role in phosphatonin inactivation . hr is more common in females with positive family history observed in 35.3% patients , nevertheless , it seems this disorder is more frequently and more severe among males in xlh form . common features are a short stature , backache , body deformities , joint pain , and fractures . dental abnormalities include dental taurodontism with increasing mean crown - body to root ratio , ectopic permanent canines , dental abcesses[2 , 5 ] and enamel hypoplasia . treatment of rickets with vitamin d ( vit d ) and phosphate supplements has been shown to prevent and cure the dental anomalies in some but not all patients . from 1970 , dental problems were reported in 23 - 67% xlhr patients[3 , 6 , 7 ] , but these problems have not been described well in previous studies . this study was a cross sectional investigation that was conducted in a referral pediatrics endocrinology clinic in iran during 3 years ( 2008 - 2010 ) . the diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets was made on the basis of clinical and radiological findings of rickets in a patient with low level of serum phosphate , normal or low level of serum calcium ( < 8.2 mg / dl ) and normal levels of 25(oh)2-vit d ( < 15 pg / ml ) , and normal or mildly elevated pth with high level of serum alkaline phosphatase ( > 55 pg / ml ) . patients who did not have a clear diagnosis or refused to participate in the study were excluded . after taking a dental history , all subjects had a dental examination ( including dental caries , enamel hypoplasia , taurodontism , dental abscesses and gingivitis ) ; opg was performed if necessary . clinical examination was performed to look for dental deformities by a trained dentist for all patients . information about dental problem including : dental abscess , enamel hypoplasia , dental caries , gingivitis , taurodontism , and delay in the primary or permanent dentition was obtained . for permanent teeth , decay , missing , or filled teeth ( dmft ) index and for primary teeth , decay or filled teeth ( dft ) delay in eruption of teeth was based on times of eruption of the primary and permanent teeth from logan and kronfeld . taurodontism was suggested if there was any change in tooth shape and was confirmed by orthopantomography ( opg ) . in this study we enrolled 19 patients with hypophosphatemic rickets . mean age of these patients was 104.23 years ( range 3 - 17 ) . eleven ( 57.9% ) patients were female and 8 patients ( 42.1% ) male ( female to male ratio : 2/1.3 ) . fifteen ( 79% ) patients had regular follow - up after diagnosis of background disease and 17 ( 89.5% ) patients had at least one dental problem . the most common dental problems were dental caries and delay in eruption of the dentition in 9 ( 47.7% ) patients . enamel hypoplasia was found in 8 ( 42.1% ) patients and 3 ( 15.8% ) patients had taurodontism and all last group were male . both dental abscesses and gingivitis were found in 2 ( 10.5% ) patients . six ( 54.5% ) female and 3 ( 37.5% ) male patients had dental caries . the prevalence of dental caries was significantly more frequent in case group ( p=0.04 ) that was 10.5% in healthy control matched group . this study showed that hr has a variable age of presentation and it was more common in females[2 , 3 ] . dental caries was the most common finding in this study ( 47.7% ) that was similar to chaussain - miller 's study . dental caries is one of the most common factors for pulp infection , so oral hygiene has an important role for caries prevention . dental abscesses were found in 10.5% of the patients compared to 25 - 65% in other studies[4 , 6 , 12 ] . in patients with hr the dentition is highly susceptible to dental caries and bacteria can invade easily from the oral cavity to the dental pulp by means of structural defects in the enamel . difference of prevalence of dental abscess may be due to early diagnostic and treatment of these patients , although shroff et al believe that prophylactic pulpotomy therapy may have been no benefit in preserving the primary dentition in xlhr patients . in our study , enamel hyperplasia has been reported in 16.6% patients with permanent teeth by bender and naidorf , however they said the incidence of this disorder is 36.8% ( 14/38 ) in cases reported in the literature , this is similar to our study . although this phenomena is expectable in hr patients , no significant differences was reported in dental age compared with the respective chronological age in a study . genetic mechanisms have a main role causing defective dentition and dentine mineralization . in this study taurodontism had a significantly increased tendency in male xlhr subjects . similar findings were reported by seow et al . in a controlled , longitudinal study , they showed taurodontism had a significantly higher tendency in male xlhr patients . patients respond well to a combination of oral phosphate and 1,25(oh)2-vitd ( calcitriol)[4 , 6 ] . the beneficial dental effect of phosphate supplements after birth and the possible influence of maternal phosphate homeostasis suggest that most abnormal dental features are linked to hypophosphatemia and deficient renal production of 1,25(oh)2-d . some effects of 1,25(oh)2-d on dentin may be indirect , through an increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus . 1,25(oh)2-d may also exert some direct effect on dental cells , as odontoblasts and ameloblasts express the vitamin d receptor and respond in vitro to this vitamin . it seems , the best results were achieved when medication started during early childhood[4 , 18 ] . dental care of these patients should consist of periodic examination , topical fluoride application , pit and fissure sealants and maintenance of good oral hygiene . dental caries as common as delay in dentition were the most prevalent problems in xlhr patients that could be reduced by proper dental care and good oral hygiene . so the dentist as well as pediatrician should be made aware of the features of disorder and early intervention .","objectivehypophosphatemic rickets is an uncommon metabolic bone disorder which affects all ages and both sexes . 
 it is characterized by low concentration of serum phosphate levels , impairment of mineralization of bone matrix and teeth with variable etiology . 
 dental problems in this disorder have not been described well in previous studies.methodsall hypophosphatemic rickets patients who came to a referral clinic during 2008 - 2010 enrolled in this study . 
 all patients had low phosphorous and high alp , normal pth and 25-hydroxy - vitamin d and normal or low level of serum calcium . 
 after diagnosis all patients were examined by a dentist for enamel hypoplasia , taurodontism , dental abscess , gingivitis , dental caries , and dentition delay.findingsnineteen patients were enrolled in this study . 
 the average age of the patients was 10 ( 4.23 ) years ( range 3 - 17 ) . 
 seventy - nine percent of patients had regular follow - up after diagnosis of background disease . 
 dental caries and delay in the dentition were most prevalent ( each one 47.7% ) followed by enamel hypoplasia in 42.1% of the patients . 
 other problems were taurodontism in 15.8% patients , dental abscess and gingivitis in 10.9%.conclusionhypophosphatemic rickets is a disease with different clinical features ; one of them is dental problem , dental caries is the most common problem .",314
"cf patients at the um cf center are routinely seen at quarterly intervals , and their clinical and laboratory data are recorded in the cf database . annual ogtt screening starts at 6 years of age for pancreatic - insufficient patients not already on insulin treatment for diabetes . clinical data were retrieved from patients who had an ogtt performed between january 1 , 1996 , and december 31 , 2005 , to identify individuals who had ifg as defined by fasting glucose 100125 mg / dl ( 5.66.9 mmol / l ) . all patients and their parents gave informed consent , permitting their records to be reviewed for research purposes . subjects who had at least one ogtt performed during the study period were identified as having normal glucose tolerance ( ngt ) , igt , cystic fibrosis related diabetes without fasting hyperglycemia ( cfrd fh ) or cfrd with fasting hyperglycemia ( cfrd fh+ ) by standard definitions ( table 1 ) . additionally , the presence of ifg was noted within each of the first three categories . as cf patients may have fluctuations in the ogtt category from year to year , baseline for subjects with ifg was considered the ogtt within the study period when they first demonstrated fasting glucose elevation . for all other subjects , classification of glucose tolerance abnormalities in cf because ogtt results can vary from year to year , patients are categorized based on the first ogtt with ifg during the test period , or for those who never developed ifg , the first ogtt during the test period . following the initial population assessment of ifg prevalence , subjects with ifg were matched by age , sex , and ogtt category to cf patients with normal fasting glucose ( nfg ) levels . patients were evaluated for subsequent progression to cfrd fh+ , changes in lung function and nutritional status , and death during the study period . lung function was determined by change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( fev1 ) and forced vital capacity ( fvc ) . subjects were determined to be pancreatic insufficient based on their need for enzyme replacement therapy . only patients with diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia , and thus none of the patients included in the current analysis , were treated with insulin . ogtts occurred during yearly screening visits when patients were determined to be in a state of stable baseline health . blood was sampled through an indwelling catheter for glucose and insulin levels at time 0 and every 30 min for 2 h. plasma insulin levels were measured in the um fairview laboratory by radioimmunoassay using a double -

control cohort study was performed . subjects with ifg were matched by age , sex , and ogtt category to cf patients with normal fasting glucose ( nfg ) levels . patients were evaluated for subsequent progression to cfrd fh+ , changes in lung function and nutritional status , and death during the study period . lung function was determined by change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( fev1 ) and forced vital capacity ( fvc ) . subjects were determined to be pancreatic insufficient based on their need for enzyme replacement therapy . only patients with diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia , and thus none of the patients included in the current analysis , were treated with insulin . ogtts occurred during yearly screening visits when patients were determined to be in a state of stable baseline health . blood was sampled through an indwelling catheter for glucose and insulin levels at time 0 and every 30 min for 2 h. plasma insulin levels were measured in the um fairview laboratory by radioimmunoassay using a double -

control cohort study : demographic summary for pairs matched on age and sex values are mean  sd or n ( % ) . table 3 shows the clinical characteristics of subjects and control subjects by glucose tolerance category for the total cohort and broken down by pediatric and adult age - groups . ifg subjects were matched for sex in all three categories and were matched as closely as possible for age to control subjects ; however , adult ifg subjects in the igt group were on average 2.4 years older than the control subjects ( p = 0.03 ) ( table 3 ) . the proportion of children 18 years of age was higher in ngt ( 38% ) than in igt ( 33% ) and cfrd fh ( 28% ) , but these differences were not significant . case - control cohort study : clinical characteristics of all patients with ifg and their matched nfg cf control subjects values are n ( % ) or mean  se . follow - up % predicted fev1 and fvc measured > 60 days before death . at baseline , ifg case subjects within the igt category had significantly better measures of lung function compared with their control subjects with an 20% higher fev1 and a 10% higher fvc ( p = 0.005 and 0.033 , respectively ) . this was primarily related to better lung function in pediatric patients with igt who had 30% higher fev1 at baseline ( p = 0.008 ) . while adults with ifg had a 28% higher fev1 at baseline than their nfg control subjects , it did not achieve statistical significance ( p = 0.081 ) . lung function for both children and adults did not significantly differ between subjects with ifg and their nfg control subjects in the ngt or cfrd fh categories . overall there was a slightly longer duration of follow - up for the ifg subjects ( 7.6 vs. 6.2 years ) . within glucose tolerance categories , this difference was significant only in the cfrd fh group ( p = 0.003 ) where it was related to the death rate of five deaths in subjects with nfg versus one death in an ifg subject . across all three glucose tolerance categories , the number of subjects who died among the ifg case subjects was less than or equal to the number of deaths in the control subjects for that group . only two subjects with ifg died during the follow - up period , compared with nine in the nfg control group . the overall odds of death was eight times higher for control subjects than ifg case subjects ( 95% ci 1.00164 , p = 0.0499 , based on nine informative pairs where paired participants had different outcomes ) . at follow - up , analysis of lung function showed that within the igt category , fev1 continued to be about 20% higher and fvc about 15% higher in ifg than in control subjects with igt and nfg ( p = 0.008 and 0.023 , respectively ) . when children and adults with igt were evaluated separately , the difference in pulmonary function was only significant for children . mean follow - up fev1 and fvc in the ifg groups were lower in both the ngt and cfrd fh categories . thus , ifg was not associated with different pulmonary outcomes in the ngt and cfrd fh categories , and it was associated with improved pulmonary status in the igt category , especially in children . in the ifg group , 57% of subjects progressed to cfrd fh+ compared with 50% of the control case subjects . overall , the odds of progressing to cfrd fh+ was not significantly higher in ifg ( or 1.6 [ 95% ci 0.73.6 ] , p = 0.301 , based on 23 informative pairs where paired participants had different progression outcomes ) . of the 310 subjects in the total study population , ifg was found in 22% ( table 1 ) . the prevalence of ifg increased with the severity of the ogtt glucose category , from 14% of those with ngt , 31% of igt , and 53% of cfrd fh ( p < 0.0001 ) . when only patients with fasting glucose levels 110125 mg / dl ( 6.16.9 mmol / l ) were considered ifg ( who criteria ) , the overall prevalence of ifg was 19% and by ogtt class was ngt 12.5% , igt 25% , and cfrd fh 46% . for the cohort study , subjects with ifg and their matched nfg control subjects showed no difference in sex , race , or baseline age ( table 2 ) . pancreatic insufficiency status was not significantly different ( 93% control subjects vs. 99% ifg case subjects , p = 0.73 ) . cf mutations were similar between case subjects and control subjects with half of patients homozygous and 40% heterozygous for f508 . the year of study entry was earlier for ifg case subjects than for control subjects but when looked at by ogtt group , this was only significant for cfrd fh ( ngt = 9 months , p = 0.25 ; igt = 15 months , p = 0.10 ; cfrd fh = 24 months , p = 0.02 ) . the frequency of ogtt evaluation was similar between groups ( 3.6 vs. 3.7 per patient , p = 0.75 ) . case -

control cohort study : clinical characteristics of all patients with ifg and their matched nfg cf control subjects values are n ( % ) or mean  se . follow - up % predicted fev1 and fvc measured > 60 days before death . at baseline , ifg case subjects within the igt category had significantly better measures of lung function compared with their control subjects with an 20% higher fev1 and a 10% higher fvc ( p = 0.005 and 0.033 , respectively ) . this was primarily related to better lung function in pediatric patients with igt who had 30% higher fev1 at baseline ( p = 0.008 ) . while adults with ifg had a 28% higher fev1 at baseline than their nfg control subjects , it did not achieve statistical significance ( p = 0.081 ) . lung function for both children and adults did not significantly differ between subjects with ifg and their nfg control subjects in the ngt or cfrd fh categories . overall there was a slightly longer duration of follow -

up fev1 and fvc in the ifg groups were lower in both the ngt and cfrd fh categories . thus , ifg was not associated with different pulmonary outcomes in the ngt and cfrd fh categories , and it was associated with improved pulmonary status in the igt category , especially in children . in the ifg group , 57% of subjects progressed to cfrd fh+ compared with 50% of the control case subjects . overall , the odds of progressing to cfrd fh+ was not significantly higher in ifg ( or 1.6 [ 95% ci 0.73.6 ] , p = 0.301 , based on 23 informative pairs where paired participants had different progression outcomes ) . a german review of 1,128 ogtts performed on cf patients 1064 years of age found 32% with ifg , but the data were not separated by ogtt category , and many subjects had diabetes ( 4 ) . in an u.s . report of 73 children and adolescents with cf , 18% with ngt and 33% with igt had ifg ( 5 ) . in the present study of 310 children and adults , ifg was found in 14% of those with ngt , 31% of those with igt , and 53% of those with cfrd fh , with an overall prevalence of 22% . nutritional status and pulmonary function begin to decline several years before the diagnosis of cfrd , in the pre - diabetic period ( 8,9 ) , where clinical deterioration correlates with the degree of insulin insufficiency ( 10 ) . insulin insufficiency allows a catabolic state , negatively impacting nutrition and lung function ( 9,11 ) . we hypothesized that ifg , as part of the spectrum of glucose tolerance abnormalities in cf , would be associated with worse outcomes . mortality was significantly reduced in patients with ifg , and lung function was better in pediatric patients with ifg in the igt group and not significantly worse in adults with ifg and igt or in children and adults with ifg in the ngt and cfrd fh groups . an explanation for the unexpected association of ifg with improved or no worse clinical outcomes may lie in the etiology of ifg . in the general population , epidemiologic studies suggest that ifg and igt are two distinct categories with only partial overlap ( 1215 ) . both ifg and igt identify individuals at risk for future diabetes , involve impairment of early ( first - phase ) insulin secretion , and are associated with insulin resistance ( 16 ) . , it occurs primarily in the liver , which results in excessive hepatic glucose production ( hgp ) and fasting hyperglycemia despite normal fasting insulin levels . fasting hyperglycemia may also be related to impaired glucose  mediated glucose uptake ( glucose uptake not related to insulin , which predominates in the fasting state ) ( 14 ) . because peripheral muscle insulin sensitivity and late ( second - phase ) insulin secretion are normal in patients with ifg , glucose levels normalize after a glucose load . in contrast , insulin resistance in igt occurs primarily in skeletal muscle ; this , combined with defective second  phase insulin secretion , results in postload hyperglycemia ( 12,15 ) . in cf , euglycemic clamp studies demonstrate normal peripheral insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic cf patients and only mild peripheral insulin resistance in those with diabetes ( 17 ) . for reasons that are unclear , in contrast to peripheral skeletal muscle , hepatic insulin resistance with increased hgp is found even in nondiabetic cf patients with completely nfg levels ( 1720 ) . glucose - mediated glucose uptake is normal ( 17 ) . because elevated hgp correlates with resting energy expenditure ( 18 ) , we and others ( 17,18 ) have hypothesized that nfg levels are seen in the face of increased hgp because of an adaptive physiologic balance between high glucose utilization and elevated glucose production . the current study supports this hypothesis since healthier , better nourished cf patients would be expected to have lower resting energy needs in the fasting state , thus less ability to metabolize extra glucose produced by the liver and leading to ifg ( fig . a : in the normal population , fasting hgp is balanced by total body glucose utilization ( gu ) . b : inflammation , undernutrition , and perhaps the cf gene defect increase gu in cf patients . hgp is elevated for reasons that are not understood very well , but fasting glucose levels are normal when hgp and gu are in balance . c : in healthier cf patients , hgp is similarly elevated but gu is reduced , leading to ifg . the relation between ifg and better pulmonary status was only seen in the patients with igt . this relation was not seen in the ngt patients , who were healthier as a group . in the cfrd fh group , the relation between ifg and clinical status may have been obscured by the greater degree of inflammation and peripheral insulin resistance that characterizes cf patients with diabetes . nonetheless , the greatest impact on survival was seen in the cfrd fh group ( the study group at the highest risk for imminent death ) . within the igt group , children with ifg and their control subjects were the same age , while adults with ifg were 2.4 years older than their control subjects . although the difference in lung function compared with control subjects was only significant in children , the observation that adults with igt and ifg were no worse than their younger control subjects may be clinically important since lung function declines with age in cf . unlike the general population where ifg is a pre - diabetic state , the current study demonstrates that ifg does not appear to be an independent risk factor for the progression to diabetes in cf , although there is a nonstatistically significant suggestion that it may confer increased risk in those with ngt . the extraordinarily high rate of progressive glucose tolerance abnormalities leading to diabetes in cf may overwhelm any relation between ifg and the future risk of diabetes . while igt is well known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population , it was initially reported that no such association existed for ifg ( 21 ) . in the framingham heart study , however , ifg was found to be associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease in women but not men ( 22 ) . this is interesting given that a sex difference in mortality has also been reported in cfrd . the added diagnosis of diabetes has been associated with reduced survival in women but not men with cf , albeit from inflammatory lung rather than inflammatory cardiovascular disease ( 23,24 ) . recently gender differences in mortality have disappeared at um , perhaps because of more aggressive diabetes screening and treatment ( 25 ) . no sex differences were apparent in the current study , but the sample size may have been too small for meaningful conclusions . greater variability in lung function was seen in adults with ngt , and it can not be ruled out that the sample was too small to detect clinically significant differences . longitudinal assessment of this cohort will be important to determine whether current findings persist . ifg subjects and control subjects were matched by age at ogtt rather than year of entry so that the ifg case subjects were enrolled on average 16 months earlier than the nfg control subjects ( significant only in the cfrd fh group ) . at um and elsewhere , the cf population has shown a trend toward improvement in outcomes over the years , implying later enrollment would confer improved clinical outcome . thus , the earlier enrollment would be expected to result in a bias toward worse clinical outcomes , rather than the better results that were found in the ifg group . in summary , ifg is relatively common in the cf population . it does not signify increased risk of progression to diabetes . in our study , it is associated with improved survival , and it appears to be associated with improved pulmonary status in pediatric patients with igt .","objectivewhile glucose tolerance abnormalities are common in cystic fibrosis ( cf ) , impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) has scarcely been explored . 
 no studies have examined the relation between ifg and clinical status.research design and methodsdata were retrieved from the university of minnesota cf database on oral glucose tolerance tests ( ogtts ) performed in 19962005 . 
 subjects were identified as normal glucose tolerance ( ngt ) , impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) , or cf  related diabetes without fasting hyperglycemia ( cfrd fh ) . 
 patients with fasting hyperglycemia were excluded . 
 the presence of ifg was assessed within each category . in a separate case - control cohort study , 
 subjects with ifg were matched to cf control subjects by age , sex , and ogtt class to explore outcomes.resultsfor the total population ( n = 310 ) , the prevalence of ifg was 22% , and by ogtt class was ngt 14% , igt 31% , cfrd fh 53% . within the cohort study , 
 mortality was significantly reduced in ifg ( two vs. nine deaths , odds ratio [ or ] = 0.2 [ 95% ci 0.040.9 ] ) .

 here we identify 33 enhancers in 9p21 ; the interval is the second densest gene - desert for predicted enhancers and 6 times denser than the whole genome ( p<6.55 1033 ) . 
 the cad risk alleles of snps rs10811656/rs10757278 are located in one of these enhancers and disrupt a binding site for stat1 . 
 lymphoblastoid cell lines ( lcl ) homozygous for the cad risk haplotype exhibit no binding of stat1 , and in lcl homozygous for the cad non - risk haplotype binding of stat1 inhibits cdkn2bas expression , which is reversed by sirna knock - down of stat1 . using a new , open - ended approach to detect long - distance interactions ( 3d - dsl ) , we find that in human vascular endothelium cells ( huvec ) the enhancer interval containing the cad locus physically interacts with the cdkn2a / b locus , the mtap gene and an interval downstream of infa21 . in huvec 
 , ifn activation strongly affects the structure of the chromatin and the transcriptional regulation in the 9p21 locus , including stat1 binding , long - range enhancer interactions and altered expression of neighboring genes . 
 our findings establish a link between cad genetic susceptibility and the response to inflammatory signaling in a vascular cell type and thus demonstrate the utility of gwas findings to direct studies to novel genomic loci and biological processes important for disease etiology .",390
"in this issue of critical care , protti and colleagues   report the effects of metformin on human platelets both in vitro and ex vivo . in vitro experiments were performed on healthy platelets incubated with increasing doses of metformin , whereas ex vivo experiments were done on platelets from patients presenting accidental metformin - induced lactic acidosis . in both situations , platelets ' lactate production and mitochondrial functions were measured . in vitro , a dose - dependent relationship between metformin con centration and lactate production was found . in both conditions , high levels of metformin decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i activity , mitochondria polarization , and oxygen consumption . metformin is a biguanide that has been used as a first - line drug for type 2 diabetes treatment since 1957 in europe and 1995 in the us . metformin was reputed to induce lactic acidosis , partly because phenformin , another biguanide , was withdrawn from the market because of an unacceptable rate of this complication . however , numerous clinical studies reported a similar incidence of lactic acidosis in diabetic patients with or without metformin , leading some authors to deny the existence of metformin - associated lactic acidosis . however , in usual clinical practice , metformin contraindications are not often respected . moreover , physicians do not really monitor adequately their prescription . as a result , numerous publications reported the association between metformin and lactic acidosis . when a cause of lactic acidosis such as shock state or acute renal failure is present , the responsibility of metformin could be questioned . but when healthy patients without risk factors develop metformin poisoning leading to lactic acidosis , there is no doubt about this link . however , metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis in different animal species and decreases mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i activity in different organs . the clinical research on metformin - associated lactic acidosis was limited to retrospective studies describing incidence , risk factors , and supportive treatments . a big step forward was made when the gattinoni group   reported a decrease in oxygen consumption after metformin poisoning in humans , strongly suggesting that metformin was able to induce mitochondrial dysfunction in humans . the study by protti and colleagues elegantly confirms the implication of mitochondria in the pathophysiology of this disease . of course , the importance of platelet mitochondrial dysfunction per se has to be put in perspective . however , as demonstrated previously in the pig , platelet mitochondrial dysfunction mirrors the mitochondrial dysfunction in other vital organs . platelets are more easily accessible than vital organs like the liver or kidney . for research purposes in humans now that serious research on this rare disease has started , we can also imagine improving its care . currently , the treatment is only supportive : increasing blood pressure with fluid infusion and catecholamines and promoting metformin elimination by renal replacement therapy . restoring atp production during energy failure due to mitochondria dysfunction is still challenging . another condition associated with mitochondrial dysfunction , succinate can bypass respiratory chain complex i inhibition and restore oxygen consumption . in isolated cells , succinate is reputed not to cross the plasma membrane , but methyl succinate ( a cellpermeant succinate ) has been used to bypass metformin blockade of respiratory chain complex i .","does metformin - associated lactic acidosis really exist ? despite an old controversy , there is no doubt about it . but 
 do we understand what is going on ? 
 laboratory findings raised several hypotheses explaining the pathophysiology of this disease . 
 the main cause could be an inhibition of either gluconeogenesis or mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i. from bench to bedside , one hypothesis is now confirmed in humans . 
 metformin poisoning involves , at least partially , a mitochondrial dysfunction .",97
"at present , selecting a type of prosthetic heart valve for surgical correction of acquired cardiac failure represents a topical issue for modern medicine . biological or mechanical prosthetic heart valve are available options . in particular , xenogeneic tissue treated by fixatives and preserving solutions is applied in the former , whereas in the latter various synthetic materials were applied ( plastic , polymers , etc . ) . perhaps one of the criteria for selecting type of prosthesis might be a response of immune system to implanted xenogeneic material . indeed , a foreign body is literally placed into the blood flow , which constantly contacts with blood cells and surrounding tissues and could eventually cause inflammatory and , perhaps , autoimmune reactions . character and intensity of such reactions are subject to thorough investigation in order to , on one hand , select proper prosthetic heart valve and , on the other hand , develop approaches for improving prostheses and preventing complications and their dysfunctions . previously , it was found that biological compared to mechanical prostheses may cause inflammatory complications . despite this , other data from long - term studies revealed no significant differences between biological and mechanical prostheses in terms of subsequent complications . previously , types of immune response developed to implanted prosthesis were discussed as well . for this , a range of cells infiltrating prosthesis was examined . it was demonstrated that t cells infiltrate pannus while investigating removed biological and mechanical prostheses . upon that , quantity of the cells found inside infiltrate differed and varied depending on intensity of local inflammatory response . examination of the removed mechanical prostheses demonstrated that they contained more cd15 , cd68 , cd3 , factor viii cells upon verified infectious etiology of prosthetic failure compared to infection - free samples . in case of lacking infection accompanied by a marked fibrosis similar comparative examination of the removed biological prosthetic heart valves demonstrated that profound infiltration of prosthetic tissues with macrophages ( cd68 ) and t cells ( cd3 ) occurs in case of any prosthetic dysfunction . by analyzing 17 removed medtronic freestyle bioprostheses with average implant duration of 71.1  35.2 months it was found that signs of chronic inflammatory reaction affecting the xenograft arterial wall were observed in 15 cases . infiltrates consisted of macrophages and lymphocytes including b and t cells . during the study , it was concluded that t cells responded to implanted foreign porcine tissues with development of significant damage of host aortic wall . it is assumed that inadequately fixed tissues of porcine aorta resulting in subsequently retained antigenicity might be one of potential causes of developing inflammation . a hypothesis is confirmed regarding causes underlying development of immune reactions against implanted biological tissue related to residual antigens of animal origin retained despite special treatments and decellularization [ 7 , 8 ] . it becomes evident that both mechanical and biological prosthetic heart valves are associated with tissue reactions developing against implanted foreign materials . upon that , macrophages , neutrophils , and t cells are the major players of cellular immunity in this process . however , dynamic changes of their quantities in systemic blood flow , participation in pathogenesis of responses against foreign materials , and potential diagnostic importance were poorly investigated . in connection with this , our study was aimed at assessing t cell subsets of peripheral blood from recipients of long - term functioning biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses . all patients underwent replacement of mitral valve including 25 persons with biological and 7 with mechanical prosthesis . characteristics of patients , etiology of heart defect , comorbidities , and duration of prosthesis functioning are presented in table 1 . surgical treatment and follow - up were done at the research institute for complex issues of cardiovascular diseases ( kemerovo , russia ) . all patients underwent follow - up examination every six months after surgical correction . in comparison group 48 samples of peripheral blood from ulnar vein were collected from patients and healthy volunteers into test tubes containing 3edta . to characterize t cell phenotypes the following combinations of monoclonal antibodies ( beckman coulter , usa ) were used : ( 1 ) anti - human cd45ra - fitc ( cat . im2467 , clone ucht1 ) ; ( 2 ) anti - human cd45ra - fitc ( cat . briefly , 100  l of peripheral blood cells was stained with each combination of antibodies according to the manufacturer 's instructions for 15 minutes in the dark , at room temperature , followed by lysing red blood cells with versalyse lysing solution ( cat . the absolute number of leukocytes , lymphocytes , granulocytes , and monocytes was counted by using hematology analyzer mek-6400 ( nihon kohden , japan ) . stained samples were analyzed by running a four - color flow cytometry with facscalibur ( becton - dickinson , usa ) and navios ( beckman coulter , usa ) . mathematical processing of the flow cytometry data was performed by using kaluza v.1.2 ( beckman coulter , usa ) software . a threshold was set to a forward - scatter ( fsc ) parameter to exclude cell debris . the ssc and fsc settings were done with linear amplification and the logarithmic amplification scale was used for the fluorescence channels and dot plot analysis . fluorescence - minus - one  gating techniques were used to evaluate thresholds for positivity of individual antibodies . the following cd4 and cd8 t cell subsets were analyzed : nave ( n , cd45racd62l ) , central memory ( cm , cd45racd62l ) , effector memory ( em , cd45racd62l ) , and terminally differentiated cd45ra - positive effector memory ( temra , cd45racd62l ) according to cd45ra and cd62l expression . lymphocytic cells were gated according to forward - scatter ( fsc ) and side - scatter ( ssc ) properties . representative bivariate dot plots of the isolated lymphocyte populations from human peripheral blood samples are presented . cd3cd4 t helper and cd3cd8 cytotoxic t cells are shown on dot plots , respectively . immunophenotyping was done by analyzing flow cytometry data after costaining with cd3 and cd4 or cd3 and cd8 cell surface markers on fsc / ssc gated lymphocytes , respectively ( figure 1 ) . 
 statistical analysis of the data was done by using statistica 7.0 and graphpad prism software . the data are presented as median (  ) values and interquartile range ( 25 ; 75% ) . significance of differences between data was evaluated by applying nonparametric mann - whitney u test and w - wilcoxon test . a stepwise analysis enumerating steps , p value significance level , and f - test were performed . significance of an identifying criterion was determined after drawing scatterplots of canonical values and calculating classification value and mahalanobis squared distance . parameters of hemogram ( wbc total , count of neutrophils , lymphocytes , and monocytes ) were shown to lack differences between patients with biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses as well as healthy volunteers ( table 2 ) . while examining t cell arm of immunity it was found that recipients with biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses did not differ in terms of both relative and absolute counts of all examined t cell subsets . at the same time , these parameters were shown to differ when compared with healthy volunteers ( table 3 ) . recipients of both mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses were found to have reduced counts of cd3 cells compared to healthy volunteers . patients with biological prostheses had significantly lower relative and absolute amounts of cm tcyt and nave tcyt compared to healthy volunteers ; conversely , amount of temra tcyt and temra th cells was elevated . patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses were documented to have increased relative and absolute amount of temra tcyt compared to healthy volunteers . in addition , relative amount of th ( cd3cd4 ) cells was also found to decline compared to healthy volunteers . in contrast , no significant differences were found in examined parameters of t cell subsets from patients with biological heart valve prostheses versus healthy volunteers . moreover , no correlation between hemogram parameters and duration of prosthesis functioning was revealed as well . representative distribution of t cell subsets among patients with mechanical versus biological heart valve prostheses is shown in figures 2 and 3 . a discriminant analysis done using a forward stepwise model consisting of 7 steps demonstrated the highest significance level while verifying counts of temra tcyt relative , cd3 relative , nave th relative , em tcyt relative , cd3cd8 relative , nave tcyt abs , and partition of the examined groups based on the results of discriminant analysis is depicted in figure 4 . only in group of biological prosthesis recipients it was possible to analyze the effect of comorbidities to the changes in t cell subpopulations . there were no significant changes in patients with or without chronic ischemic heart disease , diseases of the urinary system , pulmonary , and thyroid diseases . all significant differences between biological prosthesis recipients with comorbidities ( diabetes , hypertonic disease , acute cerebrovascular accident , and gi - tract diseases ) are presented in the tables 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 . among all surface markers used in our study , various cd45 isoforms had the longest history of practical application . as early as in 1988 it was demonstrated that cd45r ( now known as cd45ra ) protein may be considered as a marker for nave or unprimed t cells , whereas uchl1 antibody recognizing cd45r0 binds to memory t cells . currently , it is known that nave t cells express cd45 molecules containing all domains within its sequence ; however , starting from antigen - specific differentiation maturing t cells begin to express their isoforms resulting from mrna splicing within exon a followed by exons b and c. gene product containing all these domains is known as cd45ra ( molecular weight 220  kda ) , whereas the product derived after final rna modification and lacking all such domains is denoted as cd45r0 ( 180  kda ) . currently , functional significance of various cd45 isoforms remains poorly investigated , which is not true for the rest of surface markers used for phenotyping main stages of maturing t cells . first described cd62l ( l - selectin ) as a molecule determining direction of migrating nave t cells trafficking into peripheral lymphoid tissues . moreover , they also demonstrated that nave t cells ( cd45ra / r0 ) mainly expressed cd62l , whereas more mature cd45ra / r0 might be separated as a cell population being both cd62l and cd62l . the latter subset bears adhesion molecules responsible for cell migration into body peripheral tissues . currently , it is considered that both cd62l and ccr7 markers determine migration of cd3cd4 and cd3cd8 t cells from peripheral blood . by staining for ccr7 and cd62l molecules on the cell surface it allows to denote nave and central memory t cells within the pool of circulatory t lymphocytes . effector memory and terminally differentiated effector t cells ( temra)is accounted for by the fact that these cell subsets function within nonlymphoid tissues . central memory t cells are characterized by surface expression of cd45r0 instead of cd45ra as well as cd62l , cd27 , cd28 , and so forth . the main difference of this t cell subset from nave t cells is that they have already passed through antigen - specific differentiation that occurred within the secondary lymphoid tissues . presence of cd62l on the surface of these cells allows to distinguish them from effector memory t cells with phenotype cd45racd62l . this feature of tcm allows them to circulate around the body for a long period of time and determines their preferential location inside the secondary lymphoid tissues . upon antigenic stimulation , antigen presenting cells possessing cognate surface ligands allow to rapidly activate t cells with high expression level of cd27 and cd28 followed by successful formation of antigen - specific t cell clones . moreover , central memory t cells better secrete il-2 , whereas effector memory t cells are more effective in synthesizing effector cytokines . in particular , 47 out of 185 patients with morphologically verified acute rejection reaction of transplanted kidney also compared with healthy volunteers were found to possess more differentiated t cells at terminal stage of chronic renal failure . in addition , patients with acute rejection reaction were noted to have signs of dysregulated t cell profile and bear elevated amount of total t cells including nave t cells but lowered count of terminally differentiated memory t cells . however , functional assays demonstrated that the latter subset had upregulated proinflammatory and cytotoxic capacity . in another study , 131 patients with normally functioning transplanted kidney were examined . among them , increased amount of terminally differentiated memory t cells in 45 patients was associated with restricted tcr v repertoire ( cd45raccr7cd27cd28cd8 ) . in 47 patients graft dysfunction ( median age = 15 years ) was documented . a 2-fold increased risk of developing graft dysfunction was observed in patients with elevated amount of temra cd8 t cells . it was found that patients at reactive stage of kidney graft rejection had elevated relative count of memory cd4 ( tem ) and terminally differentiated cd8 ( temra ) t cells compared to patients at quiescence stage and healthy volunteers . in case of acute rejection , a significant decrease in count of cd8 temra high diagnostic significance of increased level of d8 temra and reciprocally decreased nave t cells was observed in patients after bone marrow transplantation and development of chronic graft versus host disease . investigation of t cell subset repertoire in peripheral blood from patients with implanted biological or mechanical heart valve prostheses demonstrated that t cells strongly responded to foreign material . at that , despite the fact that no significant differences between all examined parameters of t cell immunity were found in recipients of different types of prostheses , some of them , however , significantly differed when compared to healthy volunteers . we assume that altered composition of t cell subsets , namely , decreased counts of cm tcyt , nave tcyt paralleled with elevated amount of emra tcyt , and emra th , points at development of xenograft rejection reaction against both mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses . it seems that despite special treatment of biological material in graft tissues , quite a large amount of xenogeneic tissue antigens still remains ( swine valve apparatus ) . t cells and monocytes become stimulated by foreign antigens that also provoke their migration into donor tissues and in situ activation resulting in release of huge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines . in particular , a whole set of such biologically active molecules may display proosteogenic activity not only supporting local inflammatory reaction , but also leading to collagen degradation and deposition of hydroxyapatites . altogether , local inflammatory and degenerative changes within prosthetic tissues may result in prosthesis dysfunction . despite the fact that no correlation between changes in t cell subset repertoire and signs of prosthesis dysfunctioning as well as duration of prosthesis functioning was found , however , it may be assumed that immune cells are involved in developing local changes within prosthetic tissues . at the same time , results of discriminant analysis suggest that t cell subsets from recipients both of biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses display distinguishing signs of response against graft tissues . moreover , in the future it might be possible to determine diagnostically relevant parameters of t cell subset properties to be used for early diagnostics of host - versus - graft reaction . unfortunately there are only few articles describing peripheral t cell subset changes in heart disease as well as in other comorbidities . nevertheless we tried to find out their impact on t cell subset compositions . studying patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention has found that cytomegalovirus - seropositive patients demonstrated a greater fall in the concentration of terminally differentiated cd8 effector memory t cells in peripheral blood during the first 30 minutes of reperfusion compared with cytomegalovirus - seronegative patients . moreover a significant proportion of temra cells remained depleted for 3 months in cytomegalovirus - seropositive patients . hereby myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in cytomegalovirus - seropositive patients lead to acute loss of antigen - specific , terminally differentiated cd8 t cells . type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune process and has other pathogeneses pathways compared to type 2 . nevertheless while studying 55 patients with type 1 diabetes it was found that percentages and absolute numbers of cm and n cells were reduced , whereas those of temra cells were markedly increased . the indices of intermediate- and long - term glycaemic control were associated negatively with the number of cm and n cells while positively with the number of temra cells . authors conclude that considerable accumulation of temra t cells suggests lifelong stimulation by protracted antigen exposure ( viruses , other agents , or residual self - antigens ) or a homeostatic defect in the regulation / contraction of immune responses . studying t - lymphocyte subsets in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) investigators found that cell count of nave cd4 ( cd4cd45racd62l ) remarkably decreased during the 1st week after the infection . during the 8th12th weeks , the cell counts of nave cd4 subset were still less than those of normal controls , while comparing with those of the 1st week . authors conclude that it will take more than 812 weeks for cd4 cell and nave cd4 subset to reach to normal levels after sars . in our research all founded significant differences in patients with and without comorbidities ( diabetes , hypertonic disease , acute cerebrovascular accidents , and gi - tract diseases ) had the common trend . we hypothesize that any chronic diseases could lead to changes in t cell populations because of the participation of immune system . meanwhile decreased relative and absolute number of central memory and nave cd3cd8 and increased number of cd45racd62lcd3cd8 and cd3cd4 in patients with biological prosthesis were in the common trend regardless of the presence of any comorbidities . that is why we assume that these changes are related to the development of xenograft rejection reaction . current study contains the following limitations : the number of examined patients with implanted mechanical prostheses was low ( 7 persons ) ; duration of prosthesis functioning was significantly shorter in this group compared to patients with biological heart valve prostheses . taking together these limitations may lead to the loss of the significant differences of the patients with mechanical prosthesis comparing with recipients of biological prosthesis and healthy volunteers .","the study was aimed at assessing t cell subsets of peripheral blood from recipients of long - term functioning ( more than 60 months ) biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses . 
 the absolute and relative number of cd4 and cd8 t cell subsets was analyzed : nave ( n , cd45ra+cd62l+ ) , central memory ( cm , cd45racd62l+ ) , effector memory ( em , cd45racd62l ) , and terminally differentiated cd45ra - positive effector memory ( temra , cd45ra+cd62l ) in 25 persons with biological and 7 with mechanical prosthesis compared with 48 apparently healthy volunteers . 
 the relative and absolute number of central memory and nave cd3+cd8 + in patients with biological prosthesis was decreased ( p < 0.001 ) . meanwhile 
 the number of cd45ra+cd62lcd3+cd8 + and cd3+cd4 + was increased ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 patients with mechanical prosthesis had increased absolute and relative number of cd45ra+cd62lcd3+cd8 + cells ( p = 0.006 ) . also the relative number of cd3+cd4 + cells was reduced ( p = 0.04 ) . 
 we assume that altered composition of t cell subsets points at development of xenograft rejection reaction against both mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses .",295
"sea ice seasons have shortened by at least 5 days / decade over most of the arctic across 1.9  million km ice seasons have shortened by at least 25 days / decade counter to most of the arctic ice seasons have lengthened in the bering sea arctic sea ice has received considerable attention in recent years because of the downward trend in both the areal extent [ e.g. , parkinson et al . , 1999 ; stroeve et al . , 2012 ] and the thickness [ e.g. , rothrock et al . , 1999 ; kwok and rothrock , 2009 ] of the ice cover . the decreasing ice cover coincides with significant arctic warming [ e.g. , jeffries et al . , 2013 ; ding et al . , 2014 ] , and indeed the positive feedback between the ice and the temperature  with warming leading to ice reductions that in turn lead to more warming because of the resulting decreased surface albedo  is thought to be a principal reason why the arctic region has warmed more than the global average [ e.g. , screen and simmonds , 2010 ] . passive - microwave satellite data have provided the primary data source for the quantification of the decreasing areal extent of the ice . these data have important advantages for sea ice monitoring . among them : the microwave signature of ice is quite different from the signature of liquid water , allowing a clear identification of the ice edge and an estimation of ice concentration ; the microwaves are coming from within the earth system , and thus the data can be collected during periods of darkness as well as sunlight ; and at selected microwave frequencies , the microwave radiation can pass through clouds nearly unaffected . these advantages allow a monitoring of the ice cover under all lighting and most weather conditions . this has enabled a robust determination of the areal coverage of the arctic sea ice since the beginning of the multi - channel satellite passive - microwave record in late 1978 . decreases in the areal extent of the arctic sea ice as determined from the multi - channel satellite record were pointed out in the late 1980s , although with due cautions in view of the brevity of the record and the minor nature of the decreases up to that point [ parkinson and cavalieri , 1989 ] . , 1995 ; parkinson et al . , 1999 ] and have accelerated in the 21st century [ e.g. , meier et al . , 2007 ; cavalieri and parkinson , 2012 ; stroeve et al . , 2012 ] , although with continuing interannual variability [ e.g. , screen et al . , important as the quantification of the ice extent decreases are , they fail to tell the full story of what the satellite passive - microwave data can reveal about the changing arctic sea ice cover . they allow quite thorough temporal detail , even down to showing changes on a daily timescale , but much less spatial detail . in this paper , instead of looking at the extent changes , the focus is on changes in the length of the sea ice season , defined ( for each pixel and each year ) as the number of days with sea ice coverage . the season - length calculations can not show the temporal detail of the ice - extent calculations , as they aggregate to yearly values , but they show much greater spatial detail , down to the pixel level . the length of the sea ice season was first defined and mapped from satellite data in the early 1990s . at that time , it was found that trends in the length of the sea ice season over the 19791986 period showed coherent patterns of shortening sea ice seasons in most of the eastern hemisphere of the arctic seasonal ice zone and in the greenland sea and lengthening sea ice seasons in most of the remainder of the seasonal ice zone , particularly in baffin bay , the labrador sea , hudson bay , the beaufort sea , and portions of the bering sea [ parkinson , 1992 ] . ( a location map appears in the supporting information , as figure s1 . ) with an additional 27  years of data , the results in this paper show the area with lengthening sea ice seasons to be vastly reduced , as by now shortening sea ice seasons dominate almost the entire seasonal ice zone . in view of the high albedo of sea ice relative to liquid water , the shortened length of the sea ice season in much of the seasonal sea ice zone results in less reflection of solar radiation back to space and more absorption of solar radiation into the ocean , providing a forcing toward further warming the system . this forcing , well known as the ice - albedo feedback [ e.g. , kellogg , 1975 ; perovich et al . 2012 ] , is so impactful that calculations with the global model of the nasa goddard institute for space studies ( giss ) show that , at least in that model , a full 37% of the global warming calculated for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( co2 ) is due to the inclusion of sea ice in the calculations [ rind et al . , 1995 ] . the sea ice reductions also result in increased transfer of energy between the ocean and atmosphere , a decreased strength of the arctic atmospheric temperature inversion , and increased evaporation , with consequences to atmospheric moisture , atmospheric circulation , and precipitation [ e.g. , screen et al . , 2013 ; vihma , 2014 ] . impacts of ice losses on the arctic ecosystem extend all the way through the polar food web , from helping to control algal production to impacting such large animals as walruses , seals , arctic foxes , and the iconic polar bears , whose primary hunting season shortens or lengthens in line with the sea ice season [ post et al . sea ice reductions affect species interactions , disease transmission , and a wealth of other aspects of the ecological system [ post et al . humans are affected by the ice reductions through the climate and ecosystem impacts and also through such economically relevant impacts as the anticipated opening of new trans - arctic shipping routes [ smith and stephenson , 2013 ] and effects on proposed offshore oil and gas exploration in the arctic [ galley et al . , the data used for this study are from satellite multi - channel passive - microwave instruments from the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the united states department of defense ( dod ) . the earliest of these instruments was nasa 's scanning multichannel microwave radiometer ( smmr ) , launched on the nimbus 7 satellite in october 1978 . fortunately , by the end of life of the smmr instrument , the first of the dod special sensor microwave imager ( ssmi ) instruments had been launched on the defense meteorological satellite program 's ( dmsp 's ) f8 satellite , in june 1987 . since june 1987 , the dod has maintained at least one ssmi or its follow - on ssmi sounder ( ssmis ) in orbit at all times . the results in this paper are from the nimbus 7 smmr , the f8 , f11 , and f13 ssmis , and the f17 ssmis . the smmr , ssmi , and ssmis instruments are also the instruments used in many studies of the decreasing arctic sea ice extents [ e.g. , johannessen et al . , 1995 ; parkinson et al . , 1999 ; meier et al . , 2007 ; cavalieri and parkinson , 2012 ; stroeve et al . , 2012 ] . for those studies as for this one , the data have been mapped onto a rectangular grid overlaid on a north polar stereographic projection with grid squares ( or pixels ) representing earth areas of 25    25  km [ nsidc , 1992 ] , and the results are based on the fundamental sea ice variable derived from the satellite data , the sea ice concentration . the ice concentration data were generated at nasa goddard space flight center using the nasa team algorithm [ gloersen et al . rigorous intercalibration was done between the smmr and three ssmi sensors [ cavalieri et al . , 1999 ] and between the ssmi and ssmis sensors [ cavalieri et al . , the data are archived and available at the national snow and ice data center ( nsidc ) in boulder , colorado . the length of the sea ice season is calculated for each year at each pixel by counting the number of days the pixel had at least 15% sea ice concentration . the 15% cutoff is also commonly used in the ice extent studies [ e.g. , parkinson et al . , 1999 ; trends in the length of the sea ice season are then calculated for each pixel by obtaining the slope of the line of least squares fit through the data for the time period of interest . trends are mapped in the results section for the first 10 , 20 , and 30  years of the record and for the full 35  years 19792013 . due to the orbits of the satellites and the characteristics of the instruments , the data sets do not include the area in the immediate vicinity of the north pole . the smmr data extend northward to 84.6n , and the ssmi and ssmis data extend northward to 87.6n . hence , results for the smmr years ( 19791987 ) and for the trends extend only to 84.6n , whereas results for individual years within the ssmi and ssmis time frame ( 1988 and beyond ) extend to 87.6n . examining maps of the length of the sea ice season for each of the 35  years 19792013 , it is clear that many fundamentals have remained the same throughout the record . for instance , comparing the starting and ending years ( figure  1 ) , which are typical of the early and late portions of the record : the area of year - round ( or at least 360  days ) ice coverage continues to include much of the central arctic and a portion of the canadian archipelago ; the overall outer edge of the ice area continues to reflect the strong influence of the gulf stream and north atlantic current , with year - round ice - free areas extending well into the polar region to the west and north of scandinavia ; and for any longitude , the general ( although not universal ) tendency is for the season length to decrease southward ( figure  1 ) . there are also , however , some clear differences in the 2013 versus 1979 conditions , among those being the reduction in the area of year - round ice coverage and the shifting of substantial areas of the sea of okhotsk and the barents sea from being within the seasonal ice zone to being ice - free year round ( figure  1b versus 1a ) . length of the sea ice season for ( a ) 1979 and ( b ) 2013 . mapping the trends in the length of the sea ice season for the first 10 , 20 , and 30  years of the record and for the full 35  years ( figure  2 ) dramatically illustrates the transition in the arctic sea ice cover . specifically : for the first 10  years , 19791988 , the trends show substantial regions with marked shortening of the ice season and substantial regions of lengthening sea ice seasons ( figure  2a ) ; with an additional 10  years , the 19791998 trends have a noticeably larger area of shortening versus lengthening seasons ( figure  2b ) ; and with the 30 and 35  year records , the seasonal ice zone has shortening sea ice seasons almost everywhere , the main exceptions being in the bering sea and portions of the canadian archipelago ( figures  2c and 2d ) . this complements well the aforementioned acceleration of the decrease in ice extents since the 1990s . trends in the length of the sea ice season for the following periods : ( a ) 19791988 , ( b ) 19791998 , ( c ) 19792008 , and ( d ) 19792013 . the statistical significance of the trends has increased markedly as the data set has lengthened . trends for the first 10  years of the record are generally not statistically significant even at the 95% confidence level , with the exception of a sizeable portion of the sea of okhotsk and smaller portions of the northeastern greenland sea and the eastern barents sea ( figures s2a and s3a for 95% and 99% confidence levels , respectively ) . however , the area of statistical significance is larger for the 20  year trends , 19791998 ( figures s2b and s3b ) and much larger for the 30  year ( figures s2c and s3c ) and 35  year ( figures s2d and s3d ) trends . the 30  year trends , 19792008 , show statistical significance at the 95% level over most of the seasonal sea ice zone ( figure s2c ) and at the 99% level over a lesser but still substantial portion of it ( figure s3c ) . the 35  year trends , 19792013 , show statistical significance at the 95% level over almost the entire seasonal sea ice zone ( figure s2d ) and at the 99% level over most of it ( figure s3d ) . figure  3 presents histograms quantifying the area of shortening and lengthening sea ice seasons . summing the relevant values in the histograms , for the 10  year 19791988 record , the area with ice seasons that lengthened by at least 5  days / decade is 5.7    10  km , and the area with ice seasons shortened by at least 5  days / decade is only 14% greater than that , at 6.5    10  km ( table  1 ) . adding another 10  years , the 20  year record has a far greater difference , with values of 2.5    10  km and 9.1    10  km , respectively . the difference is even greater for the 30  year and 35  year records ; and the contrast in areas of shortened versus lengthened sea ice seasons over the full 35  year record increases even further , percentage - wise , when considering some of the higher rates . for instance , for the 35  year record , 1.9    10  km had ice seasons shortened by at least 25  days / decade while only 78,000  km had ice seasons lengthened by at least 25  days / decade ( table  1 ) . histograms of the area of the arctic region with trends in the length of the sea ice season    75  days / decade , between 75 and 65  days / decade , between 65 and 55  days / decade , and on up to between 35 and 45  days / decade , and    45  days / decade . histograms are shown for the 10  year , 20  year , 30  year , and 35  year periods , corresponding to figures  2a , 2b , 2c , and 2d , respectively . ( in constructing the histograms , only pixels with an average of at least 1  day of    15% sea ice coverage per year are included . ) areal extent of arctic sea ice coverage in different trend categories , presented for the 10  year , 20  year , 30  year , and 35  year trends in the length of the sea ice season the season - length trends are affected very little by the selection of 15% for the ice concentration cutoff used in the calculations . a higher ice concentration cutoff would require more ice to be present before including a given day in the ice season and hence would mean shorter ice season lengths overall in each year of the record . however , sensitivity studies on the ice concentration cutoff yield very little effect on the trends . this is illustrated in figure  4 with results for a 50% ice concentration cutoff . with a 50% cutoff , the season length throughout the seasonal sea ice zone is naturally shorter than with a 15% cutoff ( figure  4a versus figure  1b , illustrating for the 2013 case ) , but when trends are calculated , results with a 50% cutoff are very similar to those with a 15% cutoff , retaining the basic pattern of the trends and confirming the primary conclusion of the dominance of shortening sea ice seasons ( figure  4b versus figure  2d ) . ( a ) length of the 2013 sea ice season when considering a location to have ice only when the ice concentration is at least 50% ( versus the 15% ice - concentration cutoff used in figures  1 and 2 ) . ( b ) trends in the length of the sea ice season over the period 19792013 when using a 50% ice - concentration cutoff . this paper examines changes in the length of the sea ice season over the period 19792013 , showing a large predominance of shortening versus lengthening ice seasons ( figure  2 ) . these results complement the more frequently discussed decreases in ice extent , showing much greater spatial detail although not nearly as much temporal detail as is shown in the ice - extent results . the season lengths show , on a pixel - by - pixel basis , at 25    25  km resolution , how much of the year has an ice cover ( figure  1 ) and how that ice - season length has changed over time ( figure  2 ) . defining the length of the ice season simply as the number of days of ice coverage avoids the considerable complication of establishing start and end dates of ice coverage . throughout the seasonal ice zone , both the autumn onset of ice coverage and the spring / summer disappearance of ice can involve multiple appearances and disappearances , some quite transitory . simply counting the days of ice coverage gives a pure accounting of the portion of the year with a reflective , insulating ice cover present and has resulted in trend maps that show a high degree of spatial coherence , with almost no speckling . throughout the entire grid , adjacent pixels show very similar results ( figure  2 ) . furthermore , the 35  year trends are statistically significant over almost the entire seasonal sea ice zone ( figures s2 and s3 ) . several studies have examined the related issue of the length of the melt season and in doing so have tackled the problem of determining dates of melt onset and freezeup [ smith , 1998 ; belchansky et al . in particular define the melt season as extending either from early melt onset to continuous freezeup ( the outer melt season ) or from continuous melt onset to early freezeup ( the inner melt season ) . the mapped 19792013 trends in the length of the melt season [ stroeve et al . , 2014 ] show considerably more speckling than appears in figure  2 , but the overall pattern of trends corresponds well , with the melt season having lengthened over much of the arctic region except for the bering sea [ stroeve et al . , 2014 ] , in line with the opposite trends for the length of the sea ice season ( figure  2 ) . the shortened sea ice seasons throughout much of the arctic provide opportunities for shipping and increased air - sea exchanges , increase the region 's absorption of solar radiation , force polar bears in some locales onto land for a longer portion of the year , and necessitate many additional adjustments within the polar ecosystem . furthermore , the impacts of sea ice decreases are not confined to the polar regions , as illustrated by the aforementioned rind et al . study in which 37% of the global warming simulated from a doubling of atmospheric co2 was due explicitly to the inclusion of sea ice in the calculations . the highly interconnected nature of the earth system ensures that major changes in one region will have at least some impact on adjacent regions . in fact , considerable evidence has been compiled to link changes in the arctic to consequent changes in weather conditions at lower latitudes [ e.g. , francis and vavrus , 2012 ; vihma , 2014 ] , and conversely , changes in lower latitudes have been viewed as forcings on recent arctic warming [ ding et al . , although there are different approaches , at times leading to different conclusions on the specifics [ e.g. , barnes , 2013 ; screen and simmonds , 2013 ] , there is no controversy that the earth system is interconnected and that major changes in one region are likely to propagate beyond .","satellite data are used to determine the number of days having sea ice coverage in each year 19792013 and to map the trends in these ice - season lengths . over the majority of the arctic seasonal sea ice zone , the ice season shortened at an average rate of at least 5  days / decade between 1979 and 2013 , and in a small area in the northeastern barents sea the rate of shortening reached over 65  days / decade . 
 the only substantial non - coastal area with lengthening sea ice seasons is the bering sea , where the ice season lengthened by 515 days / decade . over the arctic as a whole , the area with ice seasons shortened by 
 at least 5  days / decade is 12.4    106  km2 , while the area with ice seasons lengthened by at least 5  days / decade is only 1.1    106  km2 . 
 the contrast is even greater , percentage - wise , for higher rates.key pointssea ice seasons have shortened by at least 5 days / decade over most of the arcticacross 1.9  million km2 ice seasons have shortened by at least 25 days / decadecounter to most of the arctic ice seasons have lengthened in the bering sea",269
"the mammalian order primate that includes humans , apes , and monkeys in addition to several other organisms can be traced to the late cretaceous period . the rhesus macaque is in many ways an ideal model organism , being closely related to humans ( sharing a common ancestor about 25 million years ago ) and also sharing similar physiology , neurobiology , and susceptibility to infectious and metabolic diseases . since both the m. mulatta and h. sapiens genomes have been sequenced , it is known that the evolutionary distance between them is small , with local fluctuations and low divergence , particularly in chromosome x. on average , orthologs have about 97% identity between the genomes both at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels . approximately 50% of the rhesus macaque genome consists of various repetitive sequences , similar to the human genome . the phenomenon of retrotransposition that occurs in eukaryotic genomes of diverse taxonomic groups is implicated in various human genetic diseases . insertion sites of many non - long - terminal repeat ( ltr ) retrotransposons play an important role in genome evolution and are distributed throughout the genome . the phenomenon behind the selection of the insertion sites of these elements has been shown to be correlated with patterns found at pre - insertion loci . it is well known that mobile elements insertions are capable of altering gene expression , generating genomic deletions , and they can even create new genes and gene families . existing repetitive elements can also cause ectopic recombinations . despite the overall similarity in retrotransposon mobilization activity in the old world monkeys and hominid lineages , the retroelements that are presumed to have had the most dramatic impact in shaping primate genomes are the l1 family of line elements and the alu elements , their partner sines . besides contributing large amounts of dna to many genomes ( including at least 40% of the human genome ) they have also provided new genes , exons and other motifs involved in the physical and sequence structure of chromosomes . there are instances in which a previous element is now a part of the machinery that regulates gene expression . repetitive elements account for about 50% of the genome among all of the presently sequenced primate species ( table 1 ) . in m. mulatta , two classes of mobile elements are present , class i dna transposons and class ii retrotransposons . the transposons can also be categorized into different families and subfamilies , based on the relationships between their sequences . the rhesus family consists of about 320,000 copies of many families of dna transposons and about half a million copies of endogenous retroviruses . the l1s and alu elements account for most of the lineage specific insertions and these have been playing an important role in shaping the complete genome . elan was developed earlier as a suite of tools for genome - wide retrotransposon element analysis . the application of modules of this bioinformatics pipeline is described as follows : ( 1 ) elefinder performs a whole genome distribution analysis of the mges through a blastn search by making the use of perl / bioperl scripts by which the output files are parsed . it also extracts sequence 100 bp up and downstream at each mge site identified as a preinsertion locus . ( 2 ) dnascanner scans dna sequences such as preinsertion loci and analyses insertion hotspots of elements in detail so as to provide a set of signals or characteristics that are potentially recognized by an element for its insertion . the m. mulatta genome has a total of 22 chromosomes including x and y ( although the sequencing project did not sequence y ) . the only y chromosome that has been completely sequenced is of humans , and sequencing of the chimpanzee and mouse y chromosomes is in progress . the sequencing of the mammalian y chromosomes , of the organisms like rhesus macaque ( macaca mulatta ) , the white - tufted - ear marmoset ( callithrix jacchus ) , the rat ( rattus novergicus ) , the bull ( bos taurus ) and the opossum ( monodelphis domestica ) , is proposed and still under process . we present here a study of the primate macaca mulatta genome to identify and characterize insertion sites of the two representative retroelements present , and further , comparison with similar features of the human genome ( excluding the y chromosome ) . the structural and thermodynamic features as well as protein interaction measures are computed in preinsertion loci using the tool dna scanner . in the human genome , a full - length l1 element is around 6 kb long , and is reported to be the most successful tes in human genome by mass while alu elements , typically ~300 bp long are most successful in terms of copy number . currently , there are three macaque consensus sequences for alu : alumacya3 , alumacyb2 , and alumacyb4 and five of that for l1 : l1p4a , l1p4b , l1p4c , l1p4d , l1p4e in repbase ( version 13.5 ) . we first compute the nucleotide sequence divergence of l1 ( human ) with respect to the corresponding l1 ( macaca genome ) ( table 2(a ) ) . as can be seen , pairwise alignment shows a low percentage identity , with the major areas of dissimilarity in the 3 region . the macaca lineages show higher percentage similarity with each other ; with regard to the human genome , the l1 nearest to its human analog is l1p4d , while that which has diverged the most is l1p4e . macaca lineages show high similarity with each other and human alu seems to be most closely related to the macaca specific alumcaya3 ( table 2(b ) ) . tables 3 and 4 give details of the numbers of alu and l1 elements in each chromosome . the four groups constructed for the pre insertion loci were : intact on both ends , intact on 5 , intact on 3 and intact on neither end . about 1077410 copies of alus were found uniformly distributed on each chromosome . of these approximately 13.49% ( 145428 ) are truncated on the 5 end , 456752 copies ( 42.39% ) are truncated at both the ends , 30.29% are the truncated at 3 end ( 326447 ) . a negligible fraction ( 1.6% ) of l1 elements was intact on both sides : of the 94616 elements identified 22% ( 21044 ) were truncated at the 5 end and 1.38% ( 1314 ) were truncated at the 3 end and about 75% at both ends . as in the human genome , there are few functional alu copies in m. mulatta , and their distribution on the various chromosomes follows similar patterns ( fig . the x chromosome is known to have an exceptionally high number of the l1 elements ( fig . 1b ) , which also contained the largest number of truncated elements ( at both the ends ) . the y - axis represents the frequency of elements found on the different chromosomes ( marked along the x - axis ) . the y - axis represents the frequency of elements found on the different chromosomes ( marked along the x - axis ) . the pre - insertion loci were extracted and evaluated for various physicochemical properties as described in our earlier paper . the positions of the extrema were similar to those seen in other cases in the physicochemical profiles generated by dnascanner . similar tables were calculated for each m. mulatta chromosome and for all the 14 characteristics extrema were seen in the range of -9 to -11 bp for alu element and that for the l1 element was between -2 to -19 for the majority of the cases . for l1 elements , results are similar and table 5 gives the complete information about the values and the extrema for each of the properties . figures  2 and 3 show the graphs obtained for 4 physicochemical properties for alu and l1 elements insertion sites in macaca genome . control sequences were generated by scrambling the positive data set of pre - insertion sequences ; all these above properties gave a featureless distribution ( namely no extrema ) . another independent set of control sequences that were obtained by randomly selecting genomic sequences of 100 bp also gave similar featureless results . various signals upstream of the insertion sites of alu in chromosome 1 , for ( a ) stacking energy , ( b ) at content , ( c ) propeller twist and ( d ) protein induced deformability . the y axis represents value of the property and the x - axis gives the relative position with respect to the insertion site ( taken to be 0 ) . various signals upstream of the insertion sites of l1 in chromosome 1 , for ( a ) a rule , ( b ) nucleosomal bending , ( c ) nucleosomal positioning,(d ) protein induced deformability . the y axis represents value of the property and the x - axis gives the relative position with respect to the insertion site ( taken to be 0 ) . our rationale for the choice of the various parameters 1 ) regions with alternating purines / pyrimidines steps and at rich regions melt more readily . we found regions of low gc and high at content , indicating that a relatively less energy is required to melt dna near insertion sites , which in turn favors retrotransposition ( figs . ( 2 ) propeller twist is a property , involved in the distortion of the hydrogen bonds that hold two bases together . regions with specific dinucleotides with large propeller twist , followed by a lower propeller twist were obtained ( fig .  2c ) , which shows that latter regions may be easily distorted and are suitable for insertion . ( 3 ) nucleosomes are involved in dna compacting and providing transcription factors access to the respective regulatory regions . two different nucleosomal related features , the bending energy / persistence length and the position profiles of the nucleosomes , were studied . regions with comparatively low energies were obtained , within the upstream areas of the insertion sites . ( 4 ) stacking energy profiles showed a maximum near -10 , indicating that this region is unstable , leading to easy de - stacking of dna sequence , which would thereby enable an easy insertion of alu . ( 5 ) duplex stability is a measure of the relative stability of the dna - duplex structure , which is directly dependent on sequence . we obtained the region around the -10 position for alu and at -19 for l1 , with a peak , representing a region which would de - stack or melt easily . ( 6 ) dna deformability is an important property , dependent on the sequence and required for interaction with proteins . the dna deformability was calculated and a region ( at -10 for alu and -18 for l1 ) of low deformability was seen ; this facilitates retrotransposon insertion . the results of elefinder as well as the information curated in the inside database were used to find the distribution of truncation sites in the whole m. mulatta genome . the x - axis represents the length of element divided in bins of 25 , i.e.,125 , 2550 , and so on . the criteria used for the plotting was the occurrence of 5truncated and 3 intact ends and 3 truncated and 5 intact ends in the macaca genome . the basic aim was to identify the positions in the element sequence , where most of the times truncation occurs for the macaca genome as a whole . the graph plotted for the 3 truncated ends , the maximum number of hits were obtained in the last bin , i.e. , the 276300 bin has the maximum number of truncations in the macaca genome ( fig . similarly , for the 5 truncated category , the maximum number of truncations was found to be in the first bin , i.e. , the 125 bin ( fig . ( a ) the truncation distribution of alu element in macaca mulatta for bin size 25 and the graph is plotted for 3 end of alu truncated and its 5 end being intact . ( b ) the truncation distribution of alu element in macaca mulatta for bin size 25 and the graph is plotted for 5 end of alu truncated and its 3 end being intact . previously , we analyzed several genomes for distribution of mges as well as their insertion sites along with the signals facilitating their insertion . in the present study of alus ( sine ) and l1s ( line ) in the macaca genome we found that the insertion sites had physicochemical characteristics that were similar to those observed in other organisms , suggesting that these are generally important . the present study confirmed that the region 100 bp upstream from alu and l1 insertion sites show statistically significant distinctive properties both in the physical and structural characteristics , as well as in the energetics . these properties seem to play an important role in the insertion of mge . during insertion , a mge causes the target site to distort in a number of ways and requires the co - operative action of a number of proteins to break bonds , unwind the dna , and to nick the target site strand . it is due to this series of requirements , that the insertion sites for all the chromosomes , show a characteristic set of physicochemical properties , signified by the extremum peaks in each case . each of the peaks for the several properties carry biological significance and may be used further for the identification of potential new insertion sites . in each case , that the nature of the extremum that has a role in defining the trend of each property was identical for both alu and l1 ( table 5 ) , explaining that the signals that are needed for the insertion of the element is same , and are probably necessary for the insertion to actually occur , although also probably are not sufficient . detection of the most probable truncation sites for alu elements within the complete macaca genome revealed that during insertion the truncation distribution of alu peaks toward the starting positions in the case of the trailing edge truncation and is reversed for leading edge truncations . we have found that lines are present in large number in all the primate genomes which includes the recently studied gorilla genome as well as callithrix jaqqus , pan troglodytes , orangutan ( fig . there could be an evolutionary link in primate genomes through the spread of lines and sines ; alternately , there may have been a  master  l1 or retrotransposon copy in the genome of last common ancestor of all primates . the present work adds insight into primate genome architecture , showing the common structural features that promote mge insertion and genome expansion . in future work , we aim to compare the insertion sites across species- a task that will be facilitated as the diversity of sequenced genomes increases further . the genome sequence of macaca mulatta was retrieved from the ncbi ( ftp server : ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/ ) . the element sequence ( for alu and l1 ) were obtained from repbase and pairwise alignment was performed for the l1 for the human and macaca specific l1s and its lineages using standard procedures . elefinder was used to find the insertion site of alu and l1 in the macaca genome . this tool finds the nature , distribution , genomic location , and the site of truncation for each of the insertion sites and performs comparative genome analysis and also generates several set of sequences . since we have previously shown that intact copies show the presence of signal as compared with the truncated groups , the analysis of the full - length elements , i.e. , of those capable of transposition was also performed . the tool dna scanner analyses the dna for many physico - chemical properties by using various thermodynamic , protein interactions and sequence - based features , which are beyond the t density and at density . in accordance to the choice of input parameters , the program evaluates a number of properties , using windows that move along the length of the query dna sequence . since downstream sequences tend to show signals that are not sufficiently statistically significant only upstream sequences were investigated for both alu and l1 elements . the controls were selected by scrambling sequences , randomly picking sequences from genome as well as gene sequences .","mobile genetic elements ( mges ) are fragments of dna that can move around within the genome through retrotransposition . 
 these are responsible for various important events such as gene inactivation , transduction , regulation of gene expression and genome expansion . 
 the present work involves the identification and study of the distribution of alu and l1 retrotransposons in the genome of macaca mulatta , an extensively used organism in biomedical studies . 
 we also make comparisons with mge distributions in other primate genomes and study the physicochemical properties of the local dna structure around the transposon insertion site using elan . 
 the present work also includes computational testing of the pre - insertion loci in order to detect unique features based on dna structure , thermodynamic considerations and protein interaction measures . 
 although there is significant sequence divergence between the elements of m. mulatta and h. sapiens , their genome wide distribution is very similar ; comparing the distribution of l1 s in all available x chromosome sequences suggests a common mechanism behind the spread of mge s in primate genomes .",212
"although herpes simplex virus ( hsv ) infections are very common worldwide , herpes simplex encephalitis ( hse ) is a rare disease with an incidence of one case per 250,000500,000 individuals per year . approximately 50% of patients with hse are older than 50 years.1 cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , another member of the herpesvirus family , is the most common cause of congenital infection , with a prevalence rate of 0.2%2.5% in all live newborns.2,3 in adults , most reported cmv infections are seen in immunocompromised patients such as those with hiv ( human immunodeficiency virus)4,5 and after chemoradiotherapy.6 in these cases , the patients were also co - infected with hsv . here , we present a patient with coinfection of cmv and hsv type ii ( hsv - ii ) , who was admitted to the hospital for acute psychotic symptoms , but never treated with immunosuppressants before this admission . for acute psychotic symptoms of delirium , delusion of persecution , fidget , over - alertness , and aggressive behaviors , a 67-year - old chinese man was sent to the outpatient department of the shantou central hospital , guangdong province , people s republic of china , on october 15 , 2013 . on october 14 , he became suspicious , had delusion of persecution , and ran around . on the same day , he was sent to the local hospital where a magnetic resonance imaging was performed showing multiple hyperintensities in the left occipital lobe and temporal lobes in the t2-weighted images ( figure 1a ) . in addition , multiple hyperintensity lesions were seen in the temporal and parietal lobes and demyelination lesions in the white matter surrounding the lateral ventricles in the fluid - attenuated inversion recovery images ( figure 1b ) . then , the patient was referred to the shantou central hospital , affiliated shantou hospital of sun yat - sen university on october 15 . on examination , but , physical examinations showed no abnormalities ( normal blood pressure and there was no fever ) . the positive and negative syndrome scale score was 109 ( positive syndrome score of 36 , negative of 14 , and general of 59 ) . the patient had no history of head trauma and hospitalization for mental disorders or any tumors , according to the family members . emergency treatment was started with the administration of the tranquilizer sodium phenobarbital ( 100 mg ) to reduce dysphoria and aggressive behaviors , the mood stabilizer sodium valproate ( 100 mg , administered in two fractions ) to stabilize the mental state of the patient , and the antipsychotic olanzapine ( 10 mg , administered in four fractions ) for the delusion of persecution . in addition , along with supportive treatments ( piracetam 20 grams in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride ) , empirical administration of antiviral treatment ( ganciclovir 250 mg in 0.9% sodium chloride ) was instituted under suspicion of viral encephalitis . on october 16 , a blood examination was performed which showed no anemia and leukocytosis , but presented a higher percentage of neutrophil number ( 80.60% ;

39 u / l , reference range 024 u / l ) . in addition , a higher level of c - reactive protein ( crp , 113 mg / l ; 08 chest radiographs ( october 17 ) showed stale tuberculous lesions in the upper lobe of right lung . on october 18 , while the psychotic symptoms were improved , rough breath sounds were heard in the lungs , suggesting the presence of an infection there . therefore , the antibiotic treatment with piperacillin - tazobactam ( 4,500 mg in 0.9% sodium chloride ) was initiated while the other treatments continued . on the same day , an electroencephalogram was performed showing slow waves characterized by strong peaks of delta and theta frequencies in the frontal lobe of the right hemisphere ( figure 2 ) . on october 19 , a susceptibility - weighted imaging was performed , which more clearly showed the stale hemorrhages in the frontal lobe of the right hemisphere ( figure 1c ) , in addition to those seen in the left occipital lobe and temporal lobes of both sides . the outcomes of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) examination came out on october 20 , 21 , and 22 , respectively , showing blood cells in normal ranges , mild lower levels of chloride ( 117 mmol / l ; reference range 120132 mmol / l ) , and glucose ( 2.41 mmol / l ; reference range 2.84.5 mmol / l ) . no bacteria were found . but both anti - cmv igg and anti - hsv - ii igm were positive , supporting a diagnosis of coinfection with hsv - ii and cmv in the brain . on october 28 , as required by the family members , the patient was discharged . his psychotic symptoms were significantly improved as evidenced by the reduction of positive and negative syndrome scale from 109 to 71 ( positive syndrome score of 14 , negative of 13 , and general of 44 ) . the patient continued the antiviral and antipsychotic treatments at home after the discharge from the hospital . he died of progressive cachexia 4 months after the discharge ( february 26 , 2014 ) , although his psychotic symptoms did not relapse . the ethics committee of the shantou central hospital did not require approval for this case study . except for one early case report,7 all other double infections of the central nervous system ( cns ) with cmv and hsv were reported in immunocompromised patients.46,8 the patient reported here had no history of being treated with immunosuppressants . his blood examination showed normal cell count despite of the presence of anti - cmv igg and anti - hsv - ii igm in csf , which is in accordance with the reported evidence for increased production of antibodies against several neurotropic infectious pathogens including hsv - i , hsv - ii , and cmv , in the csf of individuals with bipolar disorder9 or autism spectrum disorders.10,11 the mild signs of cns inflammation in this patient may account for the absence of seizures and focal neurological signs although he presented primarily acute psychotic symptoms and mental status changes . in line with this patient with hsv - ii infection , neurological sequelae were more frequent among patients with hsv - i compared with those infected with hsv - ii.12 in addition , cmv encephalitis in immunocompetent individuals has been associated with mild signs of cns inflammation , including absent to moderate pleocytosis.1315 in contrast , cmv in immunocompromised patients was featured with more severe clinical manifestations.5,6,16 the pathological hallmark of hse is hemorrhagic necrosis in the medial part of the temporal lobes . in addition , adjacent areas such as the orbital surface of the frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus may be involved . in line with these , magnetic resonance imaging of this patient showed hemorrhages in multiple regions of the brain , including the right frontal lobe , left occipital lobe , and the temporal lobes of both sides . the hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe may be related to the peaks of delta and theta frequencies seen in electroencephalogram of this brain region . in addition , this patient showed multiple small infarctions and demyelination in the white matter surrounding the lateral ventricles . the multiple small infarctions may be the consequence of cmv infection . in line with this speculation , animal , and human studies1720 have shown the cmv - induced damage of microvascular endothelium , vasculitis , thrombotic occlusions , and hemorrhages . another feature of this patient is a very high level of crp in his blood . the co - existence of high crp level and the antibodies to cmv and hsv - ii reminded us of a recent human study , in which the crp level was strongly associated with viral detection rate and mixed viral / bacterial detection rate ; whereas the rate of bacterial detection was not associated with the crp level.21 more significantly , plasma crp was an independent predictor of mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by virus infections.21,22 in summary , we present a case of a 67-year - old male with coinfection of cmv and hsv - ii and without history of being treated with immunosuppressants . the presence of his psychosis symptoms and absence of neurological manifestations may represent the clinical features of coinfection of cmv and hsv - ii .","herpes simplex encephalitis is a rare disease . in adults , most of the reported cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) 
 infections are seen in immunocompromised patients . 
 we present a case of 67-year - old chinese male with the coinfection of cmv and herpes simplex virus type ii ( hsv - ii ) . 
 he had no history of being treated with immunosuppressants , showed symptoms of psychosis and was scored 109 on the positive and negative syndrome scale . 
 this patient presented with a rare case of coinfection of cmv and herpes simplex virus type ii with psychotic symptoms .",126
"to the surprise and deep disappointment of all involved in the treatment of lung cancer , several large trials did not demonstrate any benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) as an addition to chemotherapy [ 13 ] . basic and clinical research then focused on mutations of the gene for epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) as a predictive factor for response to monotherapy with tkis and to development of new compounds with broader and/or irreversible inhibition .   the biological basis for the negative experience with combined treatment gefitinib and erlotinib met all three standard criteria for inclusion in a combination with chemotherapy : activity as monotherapy , different mechanism of action , and different toxicity . why , then , did the combination not work ? as explained in a recent editorial , we believe that the cells of tumors sensitive to tkis are pushed into the g-0 phase of the cell cycle and therefore become resistant to cytotoxic drugs . if antagonism between the two classes of drugs is really the biological basis for the aforementioned negative experience , then an optimal combination of tkis and chemotherapy should be in an intermittent , rather than a continuous schedule . this brief report presents a single - institution experience on intermittent chemotherapy and tki in a small series of patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung . our hypothesis was that intermittent treatment would lead to superior time to progression , when compared to experience with chemotherapy alone . if confirmed , such a result would be a solid basis for a randomised clinical trial . patients eligible for the trial were chemonave with microscopically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung , had stage iii b ( wet ) or iv according to uicc - tnm classification ( 6th edition ) , had smoking history of less than 10 packs in years , had an ecog performance status 0 or 1 , and had adequate parameters of hematological , liver , and renal function to receive cisplatin - based chemotherapy . in the absence of neurological symptoms , patients with brain metastases were eligible and were treated with brain irradiation only in case of intracranial progression . all patients had their diagnosis confirmed by biopsy or cytology . at the time when the trial was initiated , testing for egfr mutations was not available . within three weeks prior to treatment , the precise extent of the disease was determined by chest x - ray and ct scanning of the chest , upper abdomen , and brain . since 2008 , pet - ct scanning has been available and included in the initial diagnostics and in followup . the treatment started with four cycles of intermittent chemotherapy and erlotinib according to the following schedule : day 1 : gemcitabine 1250  mg / m in 30-minute infusion , day 2 : cisplatin 75  mg / m , with appropriate hydration and antiemetics , day 4 : gemcitabine 1250  mg / m in 30-minute infusion , days 515 : erlotinib 150  mg daily p.o . the number of cycles depended on tolerance to cisplatin - based chemotherapy and was determined individually . immediately after the last cycle , patients continued with erlotinib 150  mg / m daily continuously until progression or unacceptable toxicity . definition of complete response ( cr ) , partial response ( pr ) , stable disease ( sd ) , and progression followed the recist criteria . the first evaluation of response was done during the third cycle of intermittent therapy , with confirmation of response during the fifth cycle . control radiological examinations were repeated every 2 months for chest x - ray , every 4 months for ct , and at 6 and 12 months for pet - ct ( only patients who had this examination during their initial diagnostics ) . in october 2010 , all biopsy samples were reviewed , and specimens with more than 10% of tumour tissue were analyzed . genomic dna was extracted from formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tissue sections using qiaamp dna ffpe tissue kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . quantification of extracted dna was done on qubit fluorometer ( invitrogen , carlsbad , usa ) . to detect egfr gene - activating mutations , we used therascreen egfr29 mutation kit ( dxs diagnostics , qiagen , manchester , uk ) . all realtime pcr reactions were performed in a 25  l final volume on abi 7500 instrument ( applied biosystems , carlsbad , usa ) . after standard chemotherapy for metastatic nonsmall cell carcinoma , the expected ttp is 5 months . the size of this single - arm nonrandomised trial of intermittent therapy was based on the assumption of 9 months as the median time to progression ( ttp ) . to obtain such a result with a confidence interval of 612 months , we planned to recruit 40 patients . the investigators strictly followed recommendations of the helsinki declaration ( 1964 , with later amendments ) and of the european council convention on protection of human rights in bio - medicine , as accepted in oviedo in 1997 . the protocol was approved by the institutional review board ( institute of oncology , ljubljana ) and by the national committee for medical ethics , ministry of health , republic of slovenia . one patient was later found to have metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas rather than primary lung cancer and was excluded from all further analyses .   with 12 patients each , twelve patients were never - smokers , and most were in good general condition ( ps 0 - 1 for 21 patients ) . with the exception of a single patient with  wet bone metastases were the most common site of metastatic disease , followed by pleura / pericardium , contralateral lung metastases , and liver . two or more sites of metastatic disease were documented in 4 and 12 patients , respectively ( table 1 ) . three patients had only cytological diagnosis , and an additional 3 had biopsy samples too small to allow for analysis of egfr mutations in tumor cells . of the 18 adequate samples , 8 were positive for egfr gene - activating mutations . the actual number of cycles of intermittent therapy was from 1 to 6 cycles ( median : 4 cycles ) . due to early progression , 7 patients were still on maintenance treatment with erlotinib , and an additional patient stopped treatment with erlotinib after 12 months in pet - ct confirmed complete remission ( figures 1 and 2 ) . for the remaining patients , median total duration of treatment was 10 months . during the initial phase , side effects of maintenance with erlotinib were skin toxicity ( grade 3 : 1  pt ; grade 2 : 11  pts ) and diarrhea ( grade 2 in 1  pt ) . all patients are evaluable for response , and no patient has been lost to followup . for the whole group of 24 patients , complete remission ( cr ) was seen in 5 pts ; partial remission ( pr ) in 9  pts ( response rate 58% ) , minimal response or stable disease ( sd ) in 8  pts , and progression in 2  pts . a clear and statistically significant ( p < .05 ) correlation was seen between the presence of activating egfr mutations and response . among the 8 patients who were positive for egfr gene - activating mutations , 4 complete and no cr and only 2 pr were seen among the 10 patients negative for mutations ( table 2 ) . for the whole group , median time to progression ( ttp ) was 13.4 months , and median overall survival ( os ) was 23 months . median ttp and os for this group was 21.5 months and 24.2 months , respectively . for patients without egfr mutations , ttp was 5 months , and os was 7 months ( table 2 and figures 3 and 4 ) . this clinical trial was launched at a time when routine testing for egfr gene - activating mutations was not yet available . selection of patients for a combination of chemotherapy and erlotinib was made on the basis of classical histopathology ( adenocarcinoma ) and smoking status . since testing for egfr gene mutations is now available , it is clear that patients with activating mutations are those who really benefit from tkis . in addition , standard first - line treatment for patients with activating egfr mutations is now monotherapy with a tki [ 6 , 7 ] . since continuing a trial with the same selection criteria and without considering the status of egfr gene activating mutations was not justified , the research group made a decision to close the trial and analyse the experience . in order to get a longer interval for intermittent erlotinib , gemcitabine was given on days 1 and 4 of the cycle . when compared to the standard day 1 and day 8 schedule , this minor modification in timing of cytotoxic drugs did not have any adverse effect on the tolerance to treatment . clearly , other platin - based schedules which apply chemotherapy on a 3-weekly basis ( such as pemetrexed - cisplatin or paclitaxel - carboplatin ) can offer an even longer interval for tkis and might be considered for future trials of intermittent treatment . two other groups recently reported promising experience with intermittent chemotherapy and tkis . in a trial from the usa , two schedules of intermittent treatment were tested . in combination with pemetrexed ( 500  mg / m on day 1 ) , erlotinib was given either as a pulse application in a high dose ( range : 800 to 1400  mg ) given on days 2 , 9 and 16 , or in lower doses ( 150250  mg daily ) on days 2 to 16 . while tolerance to this treatment was good , the small number and heterogeneity of patients recruited into this trial do not allow for any clear conclusion regarding the effectiveness of intermittent treatment . of more importance this study from asia compared gemcitabine and either cisplatin or carboplatin to a schedule with addition of intermittent application of erlotinib ( 150  mg on days 14 to 28 of the cycle ) and reported significantly superior ttp with the intermittent schedule . their experience is most valuable but may not be of direct relevance for the rest of the world , due to the well - known differences in sensitivity of lung cancer to tkis between asian and caucasian patients .   despite its small size , our trial can offer valuable experience for further research on optimisation of treatment with combinations of chemotherapy and tkis . looking at the whole series of patients , we can conclude that intermittent chemotherapy and erlotinib is a treatment of very low toxicity . it is also clear that the efficacy of treatment is closely related to the presence or absence of egfr gene - activating mutations . the most important finding is the excellent response rate with a substantial proportion of complete responses and prolonged ttp and os for patients positive for egfr gene - activating mutations . for many years , the maximal expectation of a patient with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer was a partial remission of relatively short duration in the range of 5 to 9 months . with intermittent treatment , while the number of patients in our trial is small and any definitive conclusion would be premature , we nevertheless believe that further research of intermittent therapy for patients positive for egfr gene - activating mutations is warranted . a randomised trial comparing first - line tki as monotherapy to the intermittent schedule should clarify the real value of this new approach .","background . intermittent application of chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors may avoid antagonism between the two classes of drugs .

 , this treatment offers excellent response rate , time to progression and survival .",322
"compounds 14 , 7 , 8 , and 11 were 
 synthesized following our previously reported synthetic routes . saturated derivatives 5 and 6 , unique to this work , were synthesized via the hydrogenation 
 of diastereomers 1 and 2 , respectively . 
 palmyrolide alcohol ( 9 ) and acid ( 10 ) were 
 prepared exploiting the known acid - catalyzed ring opening of 1 , followed by treating the resultant 
 aldehyde with either nabh4 ( for 9 ) or naclo2 ( for 10 ) . alcohol 12 could be accessed 
 in a similar manner from 14-epi - palmyrolide ( 2 ) . in order to detect an interaction of ( )-palmyrolide 
 a and 
 its analogues with voltage - gated sodium channels ( vgscs ) , we examined 
 the ability of these compounds to antagonize veratridine - stimulated 
 na influx in murine primary cerebrocortical neurons . we 
 previously demonstrated that veratridine is a partial agonist at neurotoxin 
 site 2 on the vgsc  subunit . murine 
 cerebrocortical neurons were loaded with the na - binding 
 benzofuran isophthalate ( sbfi ) , and the ability of palmyrolide analogues 
 to block veratridine - induced elevation of neuronal [ na]i was determined . sodium influx was monitored with sbfi ( 340/380 ) responses to veratridine 
 in the absence and presence of ( )-palmyrolide a and its analogues . the compounds shown are ( a ) ( )-palmyrolide a ( 1 ) ; ( b ) 17,18-dihydropalmyrolide a ( 5 ) ; ( c ) ( + ) -palmyrolide 
 a ( 3 ) ; ( d ) 17,18-dihydro-14-epi - palmyrolide 
 a ( 6 ) ; ( e ) [ c-5(r),c-7(s),c-14(r)]-palmyrolide ( 8) ; and ( f ) 
 [ c-5(r),c-7(s),c-14(s)]-palmyrolide ( 7 ) . data shown are from a representative 
 experiment performed in 2 or 3 replicates for each concentration . 
 in total 47 experiments nonlinear regression analysis of concentration  response 
 data for active analogues of ( )-palmyrolide a. a three - parameter 
 logistic fit of the palmyrolide a analogue inhibition of the response 
 to veratridine is shown for each active compound . the compounds shown 
 are ( a ) ( )-palmyrolide a ( 1 ) ; ( b ) 17,18-dihydropalmyrolide 
 a ( 5 ) ; ( c ) ( + ) -palmyrolide a ( 3 ) ; ( d ) 17,18-dihydro-14-epi - palmyrolide a ( 6 ) ; ( e ) [ c-5(r),c-7(s),c-14(r)]-palmyrolide ( 8) ; and ( f ) [ c-5(r),c-7(s),c-14(s)]-palmyrolide ( 7 ) . data points 
 shown represent the mean  sem of 25 experiments performed 
 with 210 replicates each ( a  f ) . values represent mean  sem 
 of 25 experiments each performed with 210 replicates . naturally occurring ( )-palmyrolide a is a neuroactive macrolide 
 that was previously shown to block veratridine - induced sodium influx 
 in neuro-2a cells ( ic50 = 5.2 m ) and to display significant inhibition of ca oscillation in murine cerebrocortical neurons , with an ic50 value of 3.70 m ( 2.295.98 m , 95% ci ) . we have confirmed and extended these original 
 findings by demonstrating that synthetic ( )-palmyrolide a 
 ( 1 , figures 2a and 3a ) and its enantiomer ( 3 , figures 2c and 3c ) produced concentration - dependent 
 antagonism of veratridine - induced increase in neuronal [ na]i . the concentration  response curves for these 
 compounds were best fit by a three - parameter logistic equation . this 
 analysis yielded an ic50 value ( 95% confidence interval ) 
 of 2.1 m ( 1.23.1 , 95% ci ) , which was in good agreement 
 with the ic50 value reported earlier for natural ( )-palmyrolide 
 a. we found that ( )-palmyrolide 
 a ( 1 ) and macrolide analogues 5 and 3 were approximately 39-fold more potent than the 
 other analogues tested ( figures 2a the observation that saturated 
 congener 5 showed a comparable ic50 to synthetic 
 ( )-palmyrolide a suggests that the enamide double bond is 
 not essential for activity . it is moreover noteworthy that acyclic 
 analogues of ( )-palmyrolide a with the natural absolute configuration 
 were inactive as blockers of veratridine - stimulated na influx . these data indicate that the three - dimensional molecular 
 shape of ( )-palmyrolide a was crucial for the interaction 
 with vgscs . in order to support these observations and to better understand 
 how structure relates to biological function , an exhaustive nmr and 
 computational analysis was next conducted on 1 and three 
 diastereomers ( i.e. , 2 , 7 , and 8) . saturated derivatives 5 and 6 exist 
 as a mixture of rotational isomers and precluded precise nmr assignments 
 from being made . chemical shift assignments of ( )-palmyrolide 
 a ( 1 ) and synthetic diastereomers 2 , 7 , and 8 were made using dqf - cosy , hsqc , hmbc , 
 and h2bc spectra . the chemical shifts of these four diastereomeric compounds follow 
 the same general trends but differ slightly , indicating that the conformations 
 of the macrolide ring are different . for example , in each diastereomer 
 a different methylene group exhibited degenerate chemical shifts for 
 its two protons . stereospecific assignments were made for most of 
 the prochiral atoms that possessed nondegenerate shifts . the noesy 
 spectra provided 74 nonredundant distance restraints for 1 , 83 for 2 , 84 for 7 , and 77 for 8 . h coupling in the h nmr spectra 
 and from the heteronuclear couplings measured by the hetloc experiments 
 ( see supporting information for all restraints ) . 
 applying the distance and torsion restraints during simulated annealing 
 calculations produced fairly well - defined ensembles of structures . table 2 summarizes the inputs 
 and results of the structure calculations . to test the specificity 
 of the restraints and their ability to discriminate between the four 
 diastereomers , restrained simulated annealing calculations were performed 
 for all 16 combinations of starting structure and restraint set . if 
 the restraints correctly discriminated between conformations , then 
 the correct combination should have the least restraint violations 
 and the lowest energy . for all four structures we found the best restraint 
 set for each starting structure was the correct one , namely , the restraints 
 derived from nmr spectra of that compound ( table 3 ) . this confirms that the restraint sets were able to correctly 
 discriminate between the diastereomers . the four ensembles generally 
 have the same overall conformation , 
 with the major differences being due to the orientations of the substitutents . all four diastereomers have a cisoid configuration 
 of the n - methyl group ( n - ch3 ) and the 
 adjacent carbonyl despite the starting structures having a transoid configuration . examining the trajectories reveals 
 that the configuration converts early in the simulated annealing as 
 the restraints take effect . the driving force in these simulations 
 appears to be noes between h-18 and the h-2 methylene group . to quantify differences between the ensembles , we calculated root - mean - square 
 deviations ( rmsd s ) between the representative structures of 
 each ensemble ( table 4 ) . the rmsd s 
 were calculated using the differences in the positions of the carbon , 
 nitrogen , and oxygen atoms of the macrolide ring after aligning the 
 structures to minimize these differences . representative structures 
 were selected as the structure having the smallest rmsd among all 
 other structures in its ensemble . the rmsd s between all four 
 representative structures were similar ( table 4 ) , with 2 having the lowest values overall , suggesting 
 that this ensemble is the most  central  in comparison 
 to the other diastereomers . visual inspection of the ensembles 
 shows that the macrolide ring 
 is relatively flat , but the orientation of the tert - butyl and methyl groups alters the global shape ( figure 4 ) . in 1 the tert - butyl 
 and methyl groups lie close to the plane of the ring , but in 7 the tert - butyl group projects almost perpendicular 
 to the plane of the ring , and in 8 the two methyl groups 
 project in opposite directions above and below the ring . examining 
 the surface electrostatic potential of the representative structures 
 ( figure 5 ) we find that 8 is the 
 most similar to the active compound 1 . however , the c-14 
 methyl group in 1 projects to the side , whereas in 8 it is situated above the macrolide ring . taken together , 
 these differences between diastereomers may account , at least in part , 
 for the observed differences in biological activity . in addition , 
 due to the highly flexible nature of the macrolide , as evidenced through 
 computational modeling , the minimized ligand ensembles reported here 
 may not necessarily reflect the structure these molecules adopt when 
 bound to their molecular target . further consideration and investigations 
 into structure  activity relationships are ongoing and will 
 be reported in due course . number of diastereotopic hydrogens 
 for which stereospecific assignments were obtained , and total number 
 of protons with nondegenerate chemical shifts . the three numbers reported for each 
 combination of starting structure and restraint set are number of 
 selected structures , average amber energy , and average violation energy . the italic cells indicate the best set of restraints for each starting 
 structure , with respect to amber energy and violation energy , and 
 also correspond to the correct pairing . the final row is the sum of the 
 three rmsd s above , a measure of the total difference from 
 the other structures . the four structures in the top row are shown in 
 a similar orientation to figure 4 . in the lower 
 row the structures have been rotated 180 about the horizontal 
 axis to show the rear face . the electrostatic potential ranges from 
 red ( 2 kcal / mole ) through white ( 0 ) to blue ( + 2 kcal / mole ) . these 
 findings suggest that both synthetic ( )-palmyrolide 
 a and its enantiomer function with equal potency as vgsc antagonists 
 to block veratridine - induced sodium influx . with regard to identification 
 of the pharmacophore of this natural product , it appears that the 
 intact macrolide is required since acyclic versions were inactive 
 as inhibitors of vgscs . moreover , analogues lacking the enamide double 
 bond were of high potency in this assay , and thus this functionality 
 appears unnecessary for blocking vgscs . finally , using detailed nmr 
 and computational approaches with the natural product and three diastereomeric 
 analogues , it was found that the c-5c-7 anti / c-7c14 syn arrangement of stereocenters 
 produces a unique combination of three - dimensional shape and electrostatic 
 potential that is responsible for the potent biological activity of 
 the natural product . in an effort to understand the similar biological 
 activity found for the natural stereoisomer and its enantiomer , continued 
 investigations in this area will focus on uncovering the specific 
 molecular target and associated binding site , which may also assist 
 in future analogue development of novel sodium channel blocking analgesics 
 derived from palmyrolide a. unless otherwise noted ,

 using an automated microplate washer ( biotek instruments ) . after measuring

 10 m sbfi - am ( invitrogen ) and 0.02% pluronic f-127 ( invitrogen ) . cells were washed five times with locke s buffer , leaving a 
 final volume of 100 l in each well . the plate was then transferred 
 back to the incubator for 15 min to allow the cells to equilibrate 
 after washing and placed in a flexstation ii ( molecular devices ) chamber 
 to detect na - bound sbfi emission at 505 nm ( cells were 
 excited at 340 and 380 nm ) . fluorescence readings were taken once 
 every 5 s for 60 s to establish the baseline , and then 50 l 
 of different concentrations of ( )-palmyrolide a and/or veratridine 
 was added to each well from the compound plate at a rate of 26 l / s , 
 yielding a final volume of 200 l / well . after correcting for 
 background fluorescence , sbfi fluorescence ratios ( 340/380 ) and concentration each palmyrolide a analogue was dissolved in 
 dmso at a stock concentration of 50 mm and stored at 20 c 
 until used . on the day of an experiment , this dilution in locke s 
 buffer resulted in palmyrolide a analogue solutions that were 4 times 
 the desired final concentration . ( )-palmyrolide 
 a ( 1 ) and analogues ( 2 , 7 , 
 and 8) were dissolved in cdcl3 at a concentration 
 of 2.5 mg in 50 l and transferred to a 1.7 mm nmr tube . the noesy mixing time was 500 ms , the hmbc delay was set to 6.25 ms 
 ( 8 hz ) , and the hetloc used a dispi-2 spinlock of 60 ms duration . chemical shift assignments were based on analysis of the dqf - cosy , 
 hsqc , and hmbc 2d experiments using ucsf sparky . topspin ( bruker biospin ) was used to analyze coupling constants 
 in the h nmr and hetloc spectra . noesy peak heights were 
 converted to upper distance restraints of 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6  using 
 in - house perl scripts . where restraints involved a group of atoms , 
 pseudoatom corrections were applied by the amber restraint generation 
 tools . force field parameters were estimated using 
 the gaff force field and the antechamber 
 program in the amber 14 package . molecular 
 dynamics simulations were nonperiodic , vacuum simulations with a distance - dependent 
 dielectric term . using sander in the amber 14 package each starting 
 structure was energy minimized , then subjected to 20 ps of simulated 
 annealing with the nmr - derived restraints in which the temperature 
 was raised from 10 k to 600 k then cooled to near 0 k. the simulated 
 annealing was run 20 times for each structure with a different random 
 number seed each time . each collection of 20 structures was sorted 
 by restraint violation energy , and outliers were discarded . to align 
 structures , the selected ensemble was superimposed on c17 , 
 o12 , c1318 , and n19 using cpptraj . to stereospecifically assign pairs of diastereotopic hydrogens , 
 pairs of noes that involved the diastereotopic atoms and had differential 
 intensities were identified , then compared with the distances between 
 these atoms in the ensemble of selected structures . if the ensemble 
 mean of one distance was more than one standard deviation from the 
 alternative , then the diastereotopic hydrogens were stereospecifically 
 assigned .","a small library of synthetic ( )-palmyrolide 
 a diastereomers , 
 analogues , and acyclic precursors have been examined with respect 
 to their interaction with voltage - gated sodium channels ( vgscs ) . toward 
 this goal , 
 the ability of ( )-palmyrolide a and analogues to 
 antagonize veratridine - stimulated na+ influx in primary 
 cultures of mouse cerebrocortical neurons was assessed . 
 we found that 
 synthetic ( )-palmyrolide a and its enantiomer functioned as 
 vgsc antagonists to block veratridine - induced sodium influx . a detailed 
 nmr and computational analysis of four diastereomers revealed that 
 none had the same combination of shape and electrostatic potential 
 as exhibited by natural ( )-palmyrolide a. these data indicate 
 that the relative configuration about the tert - butyl 
 and methyl substituents appears to be a prerequisite for biological 
 function . additional testing revealed that the enamide double bond 
 was not necessary for blocking veratridine - induced sodium influx , 
 whereas the acyclic analogues and other macrolide diastereomers tested 
 were inactive as inhibitors of vgscs , suggesting that the intact macrolide 
 was required .",265
"in 1996 , deleuze et al .   initially suspected the role of defects in the multidrug resistance 3 p - glycoprotein ( mdr3 ) in a subtype of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( pfic ) . this refers to a heterogeneous group of familial cholestatic conditions caused by defects in biliary epithelial transporters . the disease usually occurs first in childhood with progressive cholestasis leading to death from liver failure at ages ranging from infancy to adolescence . the underlying genetic and molecular abnormalities related to pfic have led to the identification of three subtypes and the description of several mutations in hepatocellular transport system genes involved in bile formation . only pfic 3 phosphatidylcholine solubilises cholesterol in mixed micelles and prevents damage to the biliary epithelium from unbound bile acids . unchaperoned bile acids in the bile of patients with mdr3 deficiency may cause chronic cholangitis . several other biliary disorders have been associated with abcb4/mdr3 mutations : low phospholipid - associated cholelithiasis ( lpac ) syndrome , intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ( icp ) , drug - induced liver injury , transient neonatal cholestasis [ tnc ] , adult biliary fibrosis or cirrhosis , and very recently intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ihcc ) [ 49 ] . in young adults , abcb4/mdr3 alterations are mostly associated with lpac syndrome and icp . in the latter case , patients typically present with pruritus that can lead to complications for both mother and fetus . in the former case , the diagnosis of lpac syndrome is often delayed and relies on clinical and biological elements . this review will focus on imaging features of hepatobiliary anomalies associated with abcb4/mdr3 deficiency in adults , with special attention to mr characteristics . intrahepatic lithiasis is considered to be very uncommon in europe and much more frequent in asia . since the description of mdr3 deficiencies , an increasing number of patients are diagnosed with lpac syndrome - related intrahepatic lithiasis . the diagnosis is frequently performed several years after the beginning of the symptoms due to their lack of specificity . the three most important are : ( 1 ) biliary symptoms in a young adult ( < 40  years old ) ; ( 2 ) symptom recurrence after cholecystectomy ; ( 3 ) presence of hyperechoic material in the biliary ducts . other minor criteria have been described , such as mild chronic cholestasis , at least one episode of cholangitis , acute pancreatitis or biliary colic , efficiency of ursodesoxycholic acid ( udca ) and similar symptoms in first - degree relatives . gene mutations have been described in patients with lpac syndrome in 2556  % of cases [ 1113 ] . at imaging , lpac syndrome is associated with various mr presentations : normal mr cholangiography , isolated intrahepatic lithiasis and , rarely , bile duct dilatations . no imaging differences can be found between patients with or without abcb4 mutation and no specific mutation can be associated with the different presentations [ 12 , 14 ] . the most common presentation of lpac syndrome is isolated intrahepatic lithiasis . in lpac patients , most stones cholesterol stones may vary in colour from light - yellow to dark - green or brown . to be classified as such , they must be at least 50  % cholesterol by weight   ( or 70  % , according to the japanese classification system ) [ 16 , 17 ] brown  stones ( pigment stones ) . those are traditionally favoured by bile infection , frequent in the asiatic population but much rarer in western countries . ultrasound examination is very accurate in detecting intrahepatic stones , since they appear as heterogeneous and echoic foci centred on the intrahepatic ducts , or as a  comet -

invasive alternative technique that has been shown to be equivalent to ercp in choledocholithiasis diagnosis and superior to ercp in intrahepatic lithiasis diagnosis [ 2123 ] . the diagnosis of biliary stone is based on the presence of round or oval shape signal voids in the lumen of the bile ducts on heavily t2-weighted sequences ( figs .  2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 ) . however , it is occasionally difficult to diagnose stones when the surrounding liquid is not present . on t1-weighted sequences , stones present with a spontaneous hyperintensity and , recently , studies have shown the superiority of these sequences over the t2-weighted sequences for the detection of biliary stones . discrepancies between mr and ultrasound have been reported as mr is not able to detect very small stones ( fig  1 ) , while ultrasound may be suboptimal in case of massive intraluminal stones ( fig  7 ) . 2unifocal mild biliary dilatation with biliary stone in a 40-year -

cystic large spindle - shaped bile duct dilatations   ( figs .  2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 ) . however , ductal plate malformations , particularly the caroli disease , have to be ruled out by the absence of specific features , such as the  central dot sign  , dilated bile ducts associated with focal area of cystic ectasia , or the fact that no biliary dilatation can be found in lpac syndrome without underlying biliary stones [ 14 , 25 ] . other possible differential diagnosis is bile duct dilatations related to focal obstacle on the biliary ducts . traditionally , downstream - acquired stenosis ( iatrogenic , biliodigestive anastomosis , sclerosing cholangitis , cholangiocarcinoma ) may lead to obstructive dilatations that appear more central without intrahepatic lithiasis . in mice , the multidrug resistance ( mdr ) glycoproteins that mediate the translocation of phosphatidylcholine across the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte are called mdr2 . whereas the main feature in mdr2 knock - out mice , which corresponds to the equivalent animal model of human mdr3 deficiency [ 26 , 27 ] , is sclerosing cholangitis , controversies exist whether a genetically determined dysfunction of mdr3 plays a pathogenic role in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis ( psc ) in humans . .   found no genetic argument supporting the role of mdr3 in psc . since then , concepts in psc understanding have evolved and many authors consider that psc may represent a mixed bag of diseases of different aetiologies in which several genes such as abcb4/mdr3 may play a disease modifier role . to support this conceptual view , our group recently reported for the first time , in a series of 13 patients with mdr3 deficiency , imaging presentations mimicking sclerosing cholangitis in two patients at mr imaging   ( figs . they corresponded to small duct fibro - obliterative lesions at pathology , and may be due to the direct toxic effect of biliary acids on epithelium . to our knowledge , this is the only report of such association of mdr3 deficiency and secondary sclerosing cholangitis but the two patients presented with recurrent cholangitis and not lpac syndrome per se.fig . three -

"the gothenburg osteoporosis and obesity determinants ( good ) study was initiated with the aim to determine both environmental and genetic factors involved in the regulation of fat mass as previously described ( 23 ) . to be included in the good study , subjects had to be male , 18 to 20 years of age , and willing to participate in the study a total of 1,068 subjects , representative of the general young male population of gothenburg ( 23 ) ( data not shown ) , were enrolled in the study . of the 1,068 subjects , complete growth and weight charts for determination of bmi between 1 and 10 years of age were available for 612 subjects ( growth chart subsample ) . dual -

mounted stadiometer and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg as previously described ( 16,23 ) . total body fat mass , percentage body fat , total body lean mass , and fat mass of the trunk were assessed using the lunar prodigy dxa ( ge lunar , madison , wi ) . a previously described ct technique was used to measure the cross -

adjusted adult body composition variables were analyzed . the variance ( r ) in adult total body lean mass explained by bmi as well as the corresponding  coefficients for the correlations increased during early childhood , leveled off during late childhood , and increased again during adolescence ( figs . the variance in adult bmi and the variance in adult lean mass explained by childhood bmi and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlations were similar until 4 years of age , when they separated distinctly ( fig . 1c and e ) . the  coefficient for the correlation between change in bmi and adult lean mass was higher during adolescence than during late childhood ( fig . 2 ) . thus , bmi changes during early childhood and adolescence but not during late childhood were major determinants of young adult lean mass . the prediction of young - adult total body fat mass from bmi and bmi changes during different developmental periods followed a different pattern from that of lean mass . the variances in total body fat mass and percentage total body fat explained by childhood bmi and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlation were low before 4 years of age , but after 4 years of age , the plotted cumulated variance ( r ) and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlation for young- adult total body fat mass and percentage body fat tightly followed the curve displaying the variance of adult bmi explained ( fig . the predictive value of childhood bmi for young - adult percentage total body fat increased substantially during late childhood years , as demonstrated by the fact that the variance in percentage total body fat explained by bmi at 4 years of age was only 1.7% , whereas it was 20.8% at 10 years of age ( fig . to analyze fat distribution in detail , we performed abdominal ct scans ( on a subset of the present good sample [ ct subsample ] , n = 201 ) for measurements of abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue areas . the abdominal ct measurements revealed that the contribution of bmi during development for the explanation of the variance in young - adult subcutaneous adipose tissue area and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlations followed a pattern similar to that of total body fat mass and percentage total body fat , with a distinct increase after 4 years of age ( fig . 1d and f ) . for both young - adult percentage fat mass and subcutaneous adipose tissue area , the  coefficients for the correlations were of similar magnitude during late childhood and adolescence but clearly higher than seen during early childhood ( fig . bmi changes during late childhood and adolescence , but not during early childhood , clearly predicted young - adult total fat mass and the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue . the contribution of bmi during the different developmental periods for the explanation of the variance in amount of young - adult visceral adipose tissue ( intraperitoneal + retroperitoneal adipose tissue areas ) and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlations followed a pattern different and clearly distinct from that of total body fat mass and subcutaneous adipose tissue area . bmi and bmi changes during early and late childhood contributed only marginally to the explanation of the variance in intraperitoneal adipose tissue area , and the corresponding  coefficient for the correlation between change in bmi and amount of young - adult intraperitoneal adipose tissue was low ( figs . 1d and f and 2 ) . instead , adolescence was the developmental period when bmi changes started to contribute substantially to the explanation of the variance in amount of adult intraperitoneal adipose tissue , and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlations between change in bmi and amount of young - adult intraperitoneal adipose tissue were then higher than seen during early and late childhood ( fig . the results for retroperitoneal adipose tissue were similar as seen for intraperitoneal adipose tissue ( data not shown ) . analyses using weight for age during childhood and adolescence showed , in a manner similar to that seen for bmi for age , clear age -

adult subcutaneous adipose tissue area and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlations followed a pattern similar to that of total body fat mass and percentage total body fat , with a distinct increase after 4 years of age ( fig . 1d and f ) . for both young -

adult total fat mass and the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue . the contribution of bmi during the different developmental periods for the explanation of the variance in amount of young - adult visceral adipose tissue ( intraperitoneal + retroperitoneal adipose tissue areas ) and the corresponding  coefficients for the correlations followed a pattern different and clearly distinct from that of total body fat mass and subcutaneous adipose tissue area . bmi and bmi changes during early and late childhood contributed only marginally to the explanation of the variance in intraperitoneal adipose tissue area , and the corresponding  coefficient for the correlation between change in bmi and amount of young -

adult fat distribution in a well - characterized cohort of young - adult men . we demonstrate that the amount of adult subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue was associated with bmi changes during distinct developmental periods . we also identified the childhood age after which bmi increases had a clear impact on adult total body fat mass . our main finding was that the amount of adult visceral adipose tissue was associated with bmi changes specifically during adolescence , whereas the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue was associated with bmi changes during both late childhood and adolescence . subjects with more than 1 sd increase in bmi z score during adolescence had > 90% greater visceral adipose tissue areas than subjects with average change in bmi z score . these data , hence , demonstrate that bmi increases during adolescence were associated with a larger amount of visceral adipose tissue at young adult age . a large amount of visceral fat is a well - known risk factor for cardiovascular disease . a recent study demonstrated that although the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated with the metabolic syndrome , the amount of visceral adipose tissue remains more strongly related and is therefore regarded as an independent risk factor ( 5 ) . increased understanding of how and when subcutaneous and visceral fat compartments are predicted might , therefore , add important knowledge for the prevention of cardiovascular disease . in the present study , bmi increases during adolescence in subjects with a low prepubertal bmi had a similar impact on the amount of adult visceral adipose tissue as in subjects with a high prepubertal bmi . bmi increases during adolescence predicted the amount of adult visceral adipose tissue independently of prepubertal bmi . an increase by more than 1 sd in standardized bmi both during late childhood and during adolescence was , in the present study , associated with 50% more adult percentage total body fat . the new delhi birth cohort study also demonstrated that bmi changes during late childhood were associated with anthropometric measures of adult fat mass ( 13 ) . the new delhi study represents a large longitudinally followed cohort , but indicators of fat mass and lean mass were only derived from anthropometric measurements and , consequently , the visceral fat could not be determined in that study . the differences both in height and weight for age and in nutritional status between the indian children in the new delhi birth cohort and children in the western world ( 13,3234 ) might also limit the interpretations of the data from the new delhi birth cohort into the western world . a major strength of the present study is that both the subcutaneous and the visceral adipose tissue areas were measured using abdominal ct scans , giving us the opportunity to determine the predictive value of developmental bmi changes for these two fat depots separately . in a danish study , including men born between 1930 and 1956 , it was shown that subjects with both increases and decreases in bmi between 7 and 13 years of age had a higher risk of obesity in adulthood compared with those who maintained their bmi level ( 35 ) . in contrast , in the present cohort of boys born between 1983 and 1985 , increases but not decreases in bmi during growth were associated with increased adult fat mass and bmi . because the subjects in the danish study were born between 1930 and 1956 , it is possible that the decline in bmi during growth is related to environmental factors such as temporary undernourishment among certain subjects during this period ( including world war ii ) . although we in the present study have characterized the associations between childhood bmi and adult obesity , it is clear that a substantial part of adult obesity can not be explained by childhood obesity ( 6 ) . bmi changes during early childhood and adolescence were , in the present study , predicting adult lean mass , whereas bmi changes during late childhood and adolescence were predicting adult total body fat mass . these findings are in accordance with the findings in the new delhi birth cohort study , demonstrating that bmi during early childhood predicts anthropometric measures of adult lean mass more strongly than anthropometric measures of adult fat mass in indian children ( 13 ) . both the present study and the new delhi birth cohort study thus support the notion that bmi changes during early childhood are indicators of adult lean mass , whereas bmi changes during late childhood and adolescence are indicators of adult total body fat mass . our data demonstrate that 4 years of age was the threshold age for swedish boys after which bmi increases were clearly associated with increased adult total body fat mass . it should be emphasized that the present findings are based on association studies and , therefore , should be interpreted with caution . the present study demonstrates that the amount of young - adult subcutaneous adipose tissue was associated with bmi changes both during late childhood and adolescence , although young - adult visceral adipose tissue areas were associated with bmi changes specifically during adolescence . these findings suggest that avoiding substantial bmi increases during adolescence might , independent of prepubertal bmi , result in lower adult visceral fat mass .","objectivethe amount of visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for the metabolic syndrome . 
 it is unclear how bmi changes during childhood and adolescence predict adult fat distribution . 
 we hypothesized that there are critical periods during development for the prediction of adult subcutaneous and visceral fat mass by bmi changes during childhood and adolescence.research design and methodsdetailed growth charts were retrieved for the men participating in the population - based gothenburg osteoporosis and obesity determinants ( good ) study ( n = 612 ) . 
 body composition was analyzed using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry and adipose tissue areas using abdominal computed tomography at 18 to 20 years of age.resultsthe main finding in the present study was that subjects with increases in bmi z score of more than 1 sd during adolescence had , independent of prepubertal bmi , both larger subcutaneous ( + 138% ; p < 0.001 ) and visceral adipose tissue areas ( + 91% ; p < 0.001 ) than subjects with unchanged bmi z - score . 
 in contrast , subjects with increases in bmi z score of more than 1 sd during late childhood had a larger amount of adult subcutaneous adipose tissue ( + 83% ; p < 0.001 ) than subjects with unchanged bmi z score but an unaffected amount of visceral adipose tissue . 
 bmi changes during adolescence predict both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of the abdomen , whereas bmi changes during late childhood predict only the subcutaneous adipose tissue.conclusionsthe amount of visceral adipose tissue in young adult men was associated with bmi changes specifically during adolescence , whereas the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue was associated with bmi changes during both late childhood and adolescence .",350

ercp complications . anova testing was constructed by including independent variables that had significant univariate associations with success rate . the study group included 220 patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy ( 77 women and 143 men ; mean age , 72.2 y ; range , 11 to 93 y ) . the indications for ercp included cbd stones ( 152 patients ) and cbd stricture because of tumor recurrence ( 68 patients ) . the overall enterography success rate was 90.5% ( 199/220 ) , and the diagnostic success and ercp success rates were both 88.6% ( 195/220 ) . among patients who underwent billroth i gastroenterostomy and proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy , endoscopic success rate was 100% ( 42/42 ) , and the diagnostic success and ercp success rates were both 100% ( 42/42 ) . for billroth ii gastroenterostomy , the endoscopic success rates without or with braun anastomosis were 88.9% ( 120/135 ) and 88.0% ( 22/25 ) , respectively . the diagnostic success and ercp success rates for billroth ii gastroenterostomy with the duodenoscope without or with braun anastomosis were 86.7% ( 117/135 ) and 84.0% ( 21/25 ) , respectively . for patients who underwent total gastrectomy with roux - en - y reconstruction , the endoscopic success rate was 62.5% ( 5/8 ) , and the diagnostic success and ercp success rates were both 62.5% ( 5/8 ) . endoscopy was unsuccessful in 21 patients with a billroth ii gastroenterostomy and roux - en - y reconstruction because of failure to access the papilla due to the presence of a long afferent loop and tumor infiltration of the afferent loop . unsuccessful diagnostic and ercp outcomes after endoscopic success occurred only in patients with billroth ii gastroenterostomy without or with braun anastomosis because of cannulation failure in 4 patients due to tumor infiltration . factors that increased the rates of enterography success , diagnostic success , and ercp success were cbd stone , proximal gastrectomy , esophagogastrostomy , and billroth i reconstruction ( table 2).the procedure - related complication rate was 5.5% ( 12/220 ) , including hemorrhage ( 0.9% , 2/220 ) , pancreatitis ( 4.1% , 9/220 ) , and perforation ( 0.5% , 1/220 ) ( table 3 ) . one patient with a billroth ii gastroenterostomy developed afferent loop perforation , underwent laparotomy , and was discharged 2 weeks later . two patients experienced hemorrhage at the time of ercp , which was successfully treated by the local injection of epinephrine and clipping . factor that increased the risk of any procedure - related complication was type of previous surgery ( table 4 ) . factors that affected the rates of enterography success , diagnostic success , and ercp success details of the ercp treatment procedures risk factors for post - ercp complication in 220 patients who had previously undergone gastrectomy ercp in patients after gastrectomy remains a challenging technique for ercp endoscopists . as in patients with normal anatomy , anterior oblique - viewing endoscopes , side - viewing endoscopes , forward - viewing gastroscopes , and multibending endoscopes have been reported in previous studies of ercp for postgastrectomy patients.1822 however , there are 3 major obstacles to overcome to successfully perform ercp when using these enteroscope variants : ( 1 ) the approach to the ampulla of vater , ( 2 ) selective bile duct cannulation , and ( 3 ) procedural reliability , including skillful technique and dedicated devices . the forward - viewing endoscope has a long - working length and permits the operator to enter the afferent loop easily and safely because of the ability to see the lumen en face . however , this approach is particularly difficult through a native ampulla because an en face view of the papilla is difficult to obtain using forward - viewing endoscopes . moreover , optimal access to the papilla is restricted without an elevator function , and compatible devices for these enteroscopes are difficult to obtain . this lack of a cannula elevator makes it difficult to cannulate the native papilla , and the lack of dedicated devices makes it difficult to achieve therapeutic success.23,24 thus , the enterography success rate of the forward - viewing endoscope is relatively higher , but the therapeutic success rate is lower . in contrast , the side - viewing endoscope with a shorter working length has a larger working channel and a cannula elevator . however , the fact that it is impossible to see the lumen en face makes it difficult to enter the limb safely , and there are some reports of small bowel perforation associated with ercp using a side - viewing endoscope . however , the cannula elevator makes it easy to cannulate the desired duct selectively , and the larger working channel together makes it easy to achieve therapeutic success . although the enterography success rate of the side - viewing endoscope is relatively lower , the therapeutic success rate is higher after successful enterography . in this study , therefore , 2 strategies that can improve the ercp success rate in patients after gastrectomy include improved therapeutic success with the forward - viewing endoscope25,26 and improved enterography success with the side - viewing endoscope.27,28 from our experience , the working length of the side - viewing duodenoscope is sufficiently long for almost all patients after gastrectomy . our study also demonstrated a significantly higher therapeutic success rate after successful enterography using the side - viewing duodenoscope . thus , our strategy for successful ercp was to improve the enterography success rate of the side - viewing duodenoscope . among the patients who underwent billroth i gastroenterostomy and proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy , the endoscopic procedures were similar to those performed in normal digestive tracts , and the ercp success rate was 100% using the side - viewing duodenoscope in this study . compared with patients with billroth i gastroenterostomy and esophagogastrostomy , ercp in patients with billroth ii gastrectomy and roux - en - y reconstruction is more difficult and hazardous due to the markedly altered anatomy , with the direction of approach shifted to the 6-oclock position . these alterations together with abdominal adhesions create more difficulties in the intubation of the afferent loop and the approach to the papilla along the afferent loop when using the side - viewing duodenoscope . in our technique , the guidewire of the retrieval balloon was advanced to the appropriate limb , and then a retrieval balloon was inserted over the guidewire . we used this retrieval balloon to explore the correct limb with contrast enhancement to observe the tract of the limb on the radiographic images . the balloon was then hooked to the correct limb and inflated , which not only indicated the direction of the tract to guide the endoscope forward but also facilitated the forward movement of the endoscope with fewer injuries to the intestinal wall . as the balloon catheter was strongly retracted into the working channel to allow the scope to advance , the endoscope was propelled slightly forward . by placing it within the correct limb , the retrieval balloon catheter may also be used as a guide to prevent the duodenoscope from sliding out of the correct limb and into another limb upon forward motion . after successful access of the appropriate limb is achieved , the retrieval balloon becomes visible within the tract ahead , instead of emerging from it . this is particularly important at the anastomosis site , where the correct limb must be identified . it should be emphasized that the x - ray dynamic images we observed with balloon - assisted enterography proved more helpful for ercp in patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy . such visualization aids the endoscopist in viewing the altered structure clearly and allows the endoscope to move more smoothly along the digestive duct , minimizing accidental injury to the intestinal wall . we termed this procedure  retrieval balloon  assisted enterography,11,1315 which may ensure the success of ercp using the side - viewing duodenoscope . in patients who have undergone billroth ii gastrectomy and braun anastomosis , we recommend extending the duodenoscope along the greater curvature of the stomach to the gastrojejunal anastomosis , then advancing the endoscope through the efferent loop and along this efferent loop to the braun anastomosis , whereby the  middle entrance  is the correct entrance to reach the papilla of vater . for patients with billroth ii gastroenterostomy and braun anastomosis , we believe that this is the optimal ercp enterography route.14,29 using these strategies , we obtained encouraging results . for billroth ii gastroenterostomy , the endoscopic success rates without or with braun anastomosis were 88.9% ( 120/135 ) and 88.0% ( 22/25 ) , respectively . the diagnostic success and the ercp success rates for billroth ii gastroenterostomy with the duodenoscope without or with braun anastomosis were 86.7% ( 117/135 ) and 84.0% ( 21/25 ) , respectively . for patients who underwent total gastrectomy with roux - en - y reconstruction , the endoscopic success rate was 62.5% ( 5/8 ) , and the diagnostic success and ercp success rates were both 62.5% ( 5/8 ) . moreover , retrieval balloon  assisted enterography using the side - viewing duodenoscope was safe for ercp in postgastrectomy patients . only 1 patient with a billroth ii gastroenterostomy developed afferent loop perforation and underwent laparotomy . two patients experienced hemorrhage at the time of ercp , which was successfully treated by local injection of epinephrine and clipping . thus , we believe that retrieval balloon  assisted enterography is an effective and safe method , which can improve the enterography success rate in patients with billroth ii and roux - en - y reconstruction postgastrectomy . in conclusion , the side - viewing duodenoscope is a useful instrument for performing successful ercp in patients postgastrectomy . procedure may improve the enterography success rate in patients with billroth ii and roux - en - y reconstruction postgastrectomy . however , this study was retrospective and reflects the experience of a single center , suggesting that the reproducibility of this technique should be assessed in future prospective studies .","objectives : the aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the conventional side - viewing duodenoscope for successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) in postgastrectomy patients.methods:a total of 220 consecutive patients with bile duct stones or a distal common bile duct stricture who had previously undergone gastrectomy and were referred for ercp were analyzed for the outcome of their ercp . 
 all ercp procedures were performed using a conventional side - viewing duodenoscope . in patients who had undergone a billroth ii gastroenterostomy and total gastrectomy with roux - en - y reconstruction 
 , we also used the procedure of retrieval balloon  assisted enterography.results:the study group included 220 patients who had previously undergone gastrectomy ( 77 women and 143 men ; mean age , 72.2 y ; range , 11 to 93 y ) . 
 the overall enterography success rate was 90.5% ( 199/220 ) , and the diagnostic and ercp success rates were both 88.6% ( 195/220 ) . 
 endoscopy was unsuccessful in 21 patients who received billroth ii gastroenterostomy and roux - en - y reconstruction . 
 after successful endoscopy , diagnostic and ercp success was not achieved in 4 patients with billroth ii gastroenterostomy , with or without braun anastomosis , due to cannulation failure . 
 the procedure - related complication rate was 5.5% ( 12/220 ) , including immediate bleeding ( 0.9% , 2/220 ) , pancreatitis ( 4.1% , 9/220 ) , and perforation ( 0.5% , 1/220 ) . 
 there were no procedure - related deaths.conclusions:the side - viewing duodenoscope is a useful instrument for performing successful ercp in patients postgastrectomy . 
 in addition , retrieval balloon  assisted enterography may improve the enterography success rate in postgastrectomy patients with billroth ii and roux - en - y reconstruction .",441
"using water as solvent in the organic reactions is one of the most important targets to organic chemists because of the easy availability , nontoxicity , and ecofriendly nature of the water [ 17 ] . in this endeavour , a number of chemical reactions such as diels alder , hetero diels - alder , 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition , oxidations , reductions , and others are performed successfully in water [ 13 ] . also , it is reported that in few cases addition of the water increases the rate and the yield of a reaction and also enhances the enantioselectivity in a chiral synthesis . but the main problems associated with water as a solvent is its poor ability to solubilise organic reactants and incapability to create anhydrous condition for moisture sensitive organic compounds and catalysts . to overcome the solubility problem , generally a surfactant is introduced to the reaction mixture . the surfactant , due to its hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature , forms micelles with water insoluble organic compounds and promote the desired reactions to occur inside the hydrophobic ambience of the micelle core [ 9 , 10 ] . cleavage of the c = n bonds is a very important transformation in organic synthesis as the c = n functionality is widely used to protect both the carbonyl and amines . there are a number of methods used for the cleavage of c = n bonds which include acidic reagents [ 1113 ] , oxidizing agents , metallic salts [ 15 , 16 ] , ( phseo)2o , nahso3 , and others . most of these methodologies suffer from serious drawbacks like involvement of strong lewis and bronsted acids , use of toxic and costly transition metals ( i.e. , cr , pd , co ) , low temperature , longer reaction time , low yield , and difficulties in isolating the products . therefore , development of efficient , mild and environment friendly reagents are always necessary . on the other hand , bisindoles are recently emerging as extremely important class of compounds because of their novel antibacterial and anticancer activities [ 1921 ] . that is why a number of methodologies have also been postulated for the synthesis of bisindoles [ 2229 ] . in our previous communications , we reported that surfactant- ( sds- ) mediated cleavage of c = n bonds could be achieved with acetic anhydride   and surfactant - i2-water can be used for the deprotection of imines to carbonyls . we have also shown that bis- and tris ( indolyl)alkanes can be synthesized in presence of bronsted acid in water . in continuation of our research in hydrated media , herein , we wish to disclose the dual catalytic activity of the system i2-sds - h2o which behaves as a lewis acid   for the cleavage of 2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene , 1-aza-1,3-butadienes , and oximes to produce carbonyls and amines , and the resulting reaction mixture reacts with indoles to produce bis ( indolyl)alkanes in situ at room temperature under neutral conditions . for an initial study , molecular iodine was added to a mixture of 1,4-diphenyl-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene ( 1a ) ( 1  mmol ) and indole ( 2a ) ( 2  mmol ) in water . it was presumed that the activated imine should produce carbonyl compound in the reaction mixture which might be trapped with indole . but only a trace amount of 3,3-bis(indolyl)phenylmethane ( 3a ) was found to be formed in the reaction . we envisioned that the poor yield of the product may be due to the insolubility of organic substrates in water . accordingly , we added a surfactant ( sds ) to the reaction flask . to our delight , the reaction produced isolable amount of 3a as a brown solid but half of the 1,4-diphenyl-2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene ( 1a ) left unreacted in the reaction mixture . so amount of indole ( 2a ) was doubled ( 4  mmol ) and the same reaction condition successfully produced quantitative amount of 3a . the product was filtered out and the filtrate was treated with freshly distilled benzaldehyde ( 0.05  mmol ) in ethanol which furnished 1a ( m.p . this infers the simultaneous involvement of two c = n bonds of bis - anils , leaving behind hydrazine in the reaction mixture . also , no self - reaction of individual starting materials leading to indole dimer   ( 4 ) or pyrrole formation   ( 5 ) were observed under the same reaction conditions ( scheme 1 ) . optimization of the reaction conditions was undertaken by employing different catalyst loadings under various surfactant conditions . it was found that the best result was obtained by the application of 15  mol% of i2 containing sodium dodecyl sulphate ( sds ) and water at room temperature ( entry 1 , table 1 ) . in absence of the catalyst no formation of 3a was observed even after stirring for 24 hours ( entry 5 , table 1 ) . to study the scope and limitations of the reaction , i2-sds - h2o system was applied to the reaction of indole ( 2 ) and 2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene derivatives ( table 2 , entries a the bisindoles were formed in excellent yields under the reaction condition . it was observed that the reaction was relatively faster when an electron withdrawing substituent , for example , no2 , was present in the phenyl ring of the 2,3-diaza-1,3-butadienes ( table 2 , entry e ) in comparison to the electron donating groups , for example , ome and oh ( table 2 , entries b and f ) . identical results were obtained when 2-methylindole ( 2a ) was used in place of indole ( 2 ) ( table 2 , entries g and h ) . all the products were characterized by their ir , h nmr , c nmr , and mass spectral data and also by comparison with the literature report ( scheme 2 ) [ 24 , 25 ] . in order to further explore the efficiency of the i2-sds - h2o system the reaction of the oximes 6 and indoles 2 was studied . when oximes ( 1  mmol ) and indole ( 2  mmol ) were allowed to react under the same reaction condition described earlier , bis - indolylalkanes formed ( table 3 ) . the product was filtered off and the filtrate was treated with benzaldehyde in ethanol . the resulted product was benzaldoxime , which proved the liberation of hydroxylamine during the reaction . it was found that no michael addition product   was formed and only a trace amount of indole dimer 5   could be identified . the system was also applied to the reaction of 1-aza-1,3-butadienes 7 with indole ( 2 ) which produced bis ( indolyl)alkanes 8 in very good yield eliminating aryl amine in the reaction mixture ( table 4 ) . all the products were well characterized by comparison of their spectral and mass data with that of the reported value [ 24 , 25 ] . in conclusion , we have shown the dual catalytic activity of i2-sds - h2o system which deprotects the azadienes , oximes , and azabutadienes and produces bis ( alkyl)indoles in situ when indole is present in the reaction medium . the two - step reaction can be carried out without using acid , transition metals , and organic solvents . besides , the reaction condition is mild and can be done in water under neutral condition which contributes to the criteria of green chemistry . h nmr spectra were recorded on avance dpx 300  mhz ft - nmr spectrometer . chemical shifts are expressed in  units relative to tetramethylsilane ( tms ) signal as internal reference . ir spectra were recorded on ft - ir - system-2000 perkin elmer spectrometer on kbr pellets or in chcl3 . the solvents for chromatography were distilled before use . in a 50  ml round bottom flask , 15  mol% of i2 was first dissolved in water ( 10  ml ) . 2,3-diaza-1,3-butadiene ( 1  mmol ) and indole ( 4  mmol ) were added and stirred in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate ( sds ) ( 0.02  g ) for the stipulated time . the product formed was filtered off and washed with water , dried , and recrystallized from ethanol . identical reaction condition was followed when 1-aza-1,3-butadienes and oximes were used as reactants . in this case , 2  mmol of indoles were used to react with 1  mmol of imines . colorless solid ; mp : 150152c ; ftir ( kbr ) :  3418 , 3058 , 1623 , 1611 , 1445 , 1093  cm ; h nmr ( 300  mhz , cdcl3 ) :  5.95 ( s , 1h , ar ch ) , 6.73(s , 2h ) , 7.06 ( t , 2h , j = 6.8  hz ) , 7.187.27 ( m , 3h ) , 7.317.36 ( m , 2h ) , 7.367.42 ( m , 6h ) , 7.98 ( br , s , 2h , nh ) ; c nmr ( 75  mhz , cdcl3 ) : 40.7 , 111.2 , 119.1 , 119.5 , 120.4 , 122.1 , 123.8 , 126.9 , 126.9 , 128.2 , 129.1 , 136.8 , 144.8 ; hrms calcd for c23h18n2 ( m ) : 322.2851 , found 322.2832 ; anal.calcd . : c , 85.70 ; h , 5.59 ; n , 8.69 ; found c , 85.75 ; h , 5.56 ; n , 8.56 . pink solid ; mp : 76 -

"intimate partner violence ( ipv ) is an entrenched public health and social problem across both developed and developing nations . behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical , sexual or psychological harm , including acts of physical aggression , sexual coercion , psychological abuse and controlling behaviours  [ 1 , page 11 ] . there is a growing recognition and understanding of the potential health consequences of ipv both in relation to acute and chronic health impacts beyond the physical trauma cases seen in emergency departments of acute care hospitals and primary care settings . in the past two decades , a growing body of literature has focused on associations between ipv and physical and mental health across a wide range of disciplines . this is reflected in the increasing volume of research articles that deal with psychological consequences and correlates of ipv , including ptsd and other related psychological conditions .   since the adoption of the 1993 united nations general assembly resolution convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women ( cedaw ) , acceptance of ipv as a cross - cultural human rights issue affecting women across the globe has led to international agencies beginning to fund research studies [ 37 ] . there is now a much broader recognition of the public health implications of ipv , taking it from a personal and family issue related to the legal and justice system to an issue that needs to be acknowledged and addressed at a societal level . further , increasing evidence suggests that the impact of ipv is not exclusively concurrent with the experience of abuse and may last long after the violence has ceased . the sheer volume of literature in the ipv area , even when confined to health issues , can create confusion around identifying the most likely correlates and consequences of ipv . this is further complicated by the difficulties researchers face when attempting to assess the health of this population . studies are frequently confined to drawing samples of convenience ( from shelters , clinics , etc . ) and where community samples are drawn there are concerns over underreporting  all of which limit generalisability . in addition , the varying ways in which ipv is assessed leads to inconsistency in outcomes across studies . the purpose of this review paper is to provide an overview of recent research literature that has examined ipv and health . the review synthesizes literature from a broad range of studies to map patterns and trends of health consequences and correlates of ipv . literature searches of three major online databases ( scopus , sage premier , and proquest ) were undertaken , covering literature published during the time period of january 2006 to june 2012 . this time period allowed capture of the most recent papers in the field whilst maintaining the body of reviewed literature to a manageable size . to ensure that papers using a slightly different terminology for ipv were not inadvertently excluded , the search terms used included both  domestic violence  and  intimate partner violence . as this paper is concerned with the link between violence and health , the terms  physical health  and  mental health searches were conducted within the title , abstract , and keyword lists of each database . articles were firstly assessed on the basis of title and abstract in order to ascertain their relevance for this review . following this , full - text copies of studies for possible inclusion in the review , were accessed in order to conduct a more thorough evaluation of their relevance . in determining relevant studies for this review , the following inclusion criteria were used.the article reported on an original study , either from primary research or original secondary data analysis.physical and/or mental health consequences or correlates of intimate partner violence were the main foci of the research.the research focused on intimate partner violence against women , experienced at any point in adulthood , except during the antenatal or immediate postnatal period.the violence defined within the study was restricted to violence against women from a current or previous intimate partner . the full text of the research article had to be available in english.the article had been published in a peer reviewed journal between january 2006 and june 2012 . the article reported on an original study , either from primary research or original secondary data analysis . physical and/or mental health consequences or correlates of intimate partner violence were the main foci of the research . the research focused on intimate partner violence against women , experienced at any point in adulthood , except during the antenatal or immediate postnatal period . the violence defined within the study the article had been published in a peer reviewed journal between january 2006 and june 2012 . studies that reported on health effects of intimate partner violence for both men and women were included within this review only if the results were stratified by gender , so that the health implications of partner violence on women could be clearly identified . articles focused on clinical samples were excluded where the specific clinical issues might have compromised generalisability of the results , including samples where ipv occurred during pregnancy or in the immediate postnatal period , studies that focused exclusively on women with specific health condition ( e.g. , hiv - positive women ) and women with specific exposure to additional traumatic events ( e.g. , military veterans ) . studies specifically involving adolescents and high school students were also excluded , since abuse in adolescence was beyond the scope of this review , as were articles relating to health economics . as illustrated in figure 1 , initial search of the various databases using specified key terms , yielded 1077 articles . these articles were reviewed on the basis of their titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified above . this phase of the review removed 866 articles , leaving 211 articles for further consideration . full - text articles were accessed for each of these studies in order to carry out a more detailed review of their relevance . after application of the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria , the number of articles for review was further reduced to 98 studies . each of these studies was read and analysed to extract and summarise relevant findings . in this process , an additional 24 papers were removed from the review and one paper was added . upon completion of the review selection process , there were 75 studies which form the basis for the findings presented in this review . setting of reviewed studies and ipv prevalence 
  the study settings for reviewed articles are summarised in table 1 . just over 30% of the studies utilized a population - based sample and about 19% of the studies collected data from domestic violence shelters . studies based in medical settings were represented by primary healthcare ( 13.3% ) , mental health settings ( 6.7% ) , emergency departments ( 5.3% ) , and health maintenance organizations ( 2.7% ) . the lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence reported in the studies varied widely , as indicated in table 1 . in population studies , prevalence ranged from 0.98%   to 70.9% , whereas in community samples the range was from 11.4%   to 44% . the highest reported incidence ( 78.8% ) was from a sample of undergraduate university students   reporting on dating violence . studies that recruited women from domestic violence shelters , or crisis centres for women who had experienced ipv , were reported as a prevalence of 100% as were studies that recruited women who were pursuing protection orders against abusive partners through the court system . of the 75 reviewed papers , 55 reported on studies conducted in developed countries and the remaining 20 studies reported on findings from developing countries . the vast majority of studies ( n = 70 ) were quantitative in nature , three studies used qualitative methodology and reporting and two studies used a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques . the majority of studies reported findings around the mental health implications of intimate partner violence . of the 75 studies reviewed , 38 ( 50% ) dealt exclusively with mental health issues , 24 studies ( 32% ) reported on both mental and physical health outcomes , 9 studies ( 13% ) reported on physical health outcomes only , and 4 studies ( 5% ) reported exclusively on sleep problems . in this section , we describe our synthesis of findings sequentially , beginning with mental health outcomes , including depression , ptsd , anxiety , suicidality and self - harm , self - perceived mental health and psychological distress , and impact of intimate partner violence on quality of sleep and sleep disorders . the second section of the review covers findings of intimate partner violence on physical health outcomes including functional health , self - perceived physical health impact , and chronic health conditions .   from the articles included within the review , 66 studies reported on aspects of mental health in relation to intimate partner violence . depression was the most commonly researched aspect of mental health in relation to intimate partner violence , being reported on in 42 of the reviewed articles [ 10 , 1353 ] . the high relative importance of depression in its impact on health , as a result of ipv , is shown by the burden of disease figures given in the study by vos et al .   who found that 34.7% of the total ipv disease burden was attributable to depression . this is in comparison to 27.3% attributable to anxiety , 10.7% to suicide , and only 0.6% of the burden of disease attributed to physical injuries as a result of ipv . reported that the incidence of major depression during the past 12 months was 51.4% from their sample of women 's shelter residents . this compared to the national average for the general us female population of just 2.4% reporting depression in the previous 12 months . of all the studies that investigated the link between depression and ipv history , only one study , conducted in 2008 by fedovskiy et al . this study of american latino women ( n = 105 ) from a primary care clinical setting found that women endorsing a history of ipv had a higher odds ratio of having a major depressive disorder ( or 1.68 ) compared to women with no history of ipv that was not statistically significant ( p = 0.22 ) . note that their nonsignificant finding is contrary to the findings of previous studies and postulate that the high baseline levels of depressive disorder in their study sample could be a potential confounder that masks any significant effects . all the remaining reviewed studies consistently reported significant associations between a history of ipv and depressive symptoms . several studies indicated that severity or chronicity of violence was associated with more severe depressive symptoms [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 40 , 50 ] . .   indicated that subjective appraisals of the  stressfulness  of an ipv event may have a stronger impact on women 's depressive symptoms than more many studies reported on ipv as a single overarching construct ; however , other studies broke down their findings to report on individual categories of violence , most commonly : physical , sexual , and psychological / emotional abuse . experiencing more than one type of abuse increased the probability of having depressive symptoms as well as the severity of those symptoms [ 19 , 21 , 27 , 37 ] . the results reported in the majority of studies indicated that women usually reported more than one type of violence in their history of abuse . of those studies reporting on depression that did present findings on distinct abuse categories , pico - alfonso et al .   found psychological ipv to be as detrimental as physical ipv in terms of depressive symptoms in their study sample of spanish women . wong et al .   found psychological abuse to be the significant predictor of higher levels of ipv - related depression in their study of chinese women . in this study , it was found that the more frequent the psychological abuse , the higher the level of depression experienced , but this significant result was not found to be present in relation to the frequency of physical abuse . the results reported by chen et al . , in their us - based study of hispanic women , indicated that women who had experienced sexual abuse from their intimate partner were at far higher odds ( or 42.60 , 95% ci : 2.39758.61 ) of developing depression than women with either a history of physical ( or 10.28 , 95% ci : 1.5468.77 ) or psychological abuse ( or 5.83 , 95% ci : 2.1116.16 ) when compared with nonabused women . the wide fluctuations of the 95% ci for sexual abuse and physical abuse are due to the very small number of respondents in each category , indicating that these results should be viewed with caution .    the us - based study by zlotnick et al .   reported on patterns of recovery in mental health status in women with a history of ipv followed across a five - year timeframe . they concluded that women reporting ipv at the commencement of their study were still significantly more likely to experience a greater degree of depressive symptoms and functional impairment with lower self - esteem and life satisfaction at the 5-year followup , compared to women without ipv . they did not find any evidence to suggest that women remaining in an abusive relationship were worse off , in terms of psychosocial difficulties , than women who left those relationships . thus , they concluded that women who have experienced ipv are at risk of a range of long - term mental health concerns , irrespective of whether or not they stay or leave the abusive relationship .   within this review , 14 studies related to the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) in abused women [ 15 , 18 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 33 , 36 , 37 , 5456 ] . all studies agreed on the fact that a history of intimate partner violence was positively associated with the increased incidence of ptsd symptoms and ptsd diagnoses . estimated that women with a history of ipv were 2.3 times more likely to develop ptsd compared to never - abused women after controlling for race , marital status , and income . two other studies [ 23 , 33 ] reported that women with ipv histories had approximately three times the odds of meeting criteria for ptsd as compared to women who did not report a history of ipv . within the reviewed studies , the reported prevalence rates of ptsd varied widely . chandra et al .   reported , in their indian study involving female psychiatric outpatients , that of all the women reporting ipv , 14% met the criteria for ptsd . the rate of ptsd reported from a sample of women from domestic violence shelters in usa was reported as 16.2% by helfrich et al . . yet , in a similar sample of abused women from crisis shelters and the general community in usa , sampled by woods et al . , the rate of women who met the criteria for clinical diagnosis of ptsd was much higher at 92.4% . another us study of women from a health maintenance organisation ( hmo ) found that 30.9% of women with a history of ipv had symptoms consistent with ptsd , compared with 13.7% of women who did not have a history of ipv . similar to the trend for depression , it was reported that women experiencing more severe and more sustained abuse generally exhibited higher levels of ptsd symptoms [ 18 , 27 , 56 ] . also , the experience of more than one form of abuse led to greater levels of ptsd symptomology [ 21 , 27 ] . reported that the relative risk of experiencing ptsd symptoms rose with the number of abuse types experienced . women who had experienced three types of abuse were more than nine times as likely to develop ptsd as a woman who had no history of abuse . a woman experiencing only one type of abuse was just over two times as likely to develop ptsd compared to a nonabused woman . pico - alfonso et al .   stated that , in their study , the occurrence of ptsd alone was rare , with most women exhibiting comorbidity of ptsd along with depressive symptoms . this appears to be the case in several other ptsd studies as well [ 15 , 18 , 23 , 36 ] . this link between ptsd symptoms and depressive symptoms is noted by fedovskiy et al .   who report that women with ptsd were ten times more likely to also have high depression scores ( ces - d scores of > 15 ) and they suggest that ptsd and major depressive disorder comorbidity in their study may be a result of symptom overlap , especially the symptoms of anhedonia , sleep disturbance , and concentration difficulties . , anxiety was investigated as a part of sixteen studies [ 1315 , 20 , 22 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 37 , 39 , 40 , 43 , 46 , 50 , 51 , 53 ] , but it was not the exclusive focus of any of these studies , usually being reported along with other common mental disorders , most often depression . in the study on burden of disease associated with ipv , vos et al .   found that 27.3% of the total ipv burden of disease was attributable to anxiety , making it the second highest contributing factor , with only depression having a higher percentage score . in their us - based study of women from a domestic violence shelter , helfrich et al . reported that 77% of women from the shelter sample reported anxiety during the previous 12 months , compared to a reported national average of 6.1% for females from a national health survey . all sixteen reviewed studies on anxiety reported finding a positive association between a history of intimate partner violence and increased levels of anxiety in women . this relationship existed even after demographic variables such as age , education , and income were taken into account [ 22 , 40 , 43 ] . pico - alfonso et al .   reported a link between severity of anxiety symptoms and comorbidity with depression , observing that the severity of state anxiety was higher in abused women with depressive symptoms . there was also a dose - response trend apparent , with a greater severity of anxiety symptoms being present in abused women when the abuse experienced was more frequent , more intense , or more severe [ 13 , 40 , 50 ] . from the reviewed articles , six studies reported on suicide attempts [ 9 , 26 , 39 , 43 , 45 , 57 ] and twelve studies on suicidal ideation or thoughts [ 21 , 26 , 28 , 37 , 43 , 45 , 47 , 48 , 5760 ] in relation to a history of intimate partner violence . all of these studies reported an association between the lifetime experience of abuse and increased suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in women . results from the multi - country study by the world health organisation on women 's health and domestic violence relating to suicide were presented in three separate reports [ 9 , 57 , 58 ] . the paper by devries et al .   dealt specifically with suicide attempts and reported that the experience of ipv was significantly associated with suicide attempts in every one of their thirteen study sites across nine different countries . ellsberg et al .   reported that the pooled analysis , across all of their fifteen sites in ten countries , showed that women who had experienced physical or sexual violence , or both , were three times more likely to have thought about ending their lives and almost four times more likely to have attempted on one or more occasions to have ended their lives , when compared to women who had never experienced partner violence . the reported adjusted odds ratios from a study of south asian immigrant women resident in the us were even higher , with abused women being seven times more likely to exhibit suicidal ideation than nonabused women from this study sample . in their study of urban indian women , vachher and sharma   reported that 22.3% of the study subjects had ever thought of suicide , 12.0% reported suicidal thoughts in the past month , and 3.4% of the women had tried to commit suicide . suicidal tendencies were considerably more common in women with a history of partner violence , compared to those who had not experienced violence , and these differences were statistically highly significant . the effects of different types of violence in relation to suicidal ideation were reported by ishida et al .   from a population - based study of women from paraguay . they found that , for abuse in the past 12 months , physical and sexual violence were more important risk factors for suicidal ideation than emotional abuse . for abuse experienced more than 12 months ago , sexual violence had the largest adverse effect , indicating that sexual abuse had a longer lasting negative effect than either of the other two forms of abuse . this is in contrast to the results from bangladesh , reported by naved and akhtar , who found that sexual violence by a husband was not associated with suicidal ideation in either rural or urban study sites . they found emotional violence and severe physical violence to be the major determinants of suicidal ideation amongst their sample of bangladeshi women . the authors also observed a dose - response effect in suicidal ideation in women exposed to a number of forms of violence . women exposed to no violence , or a single form of violence , had the lowest reporting of suicidal ideation during the previous 4 weeks . an increase in the number of forms of violence , experienced by women in the study , led to an increase in the rate of suicidal ideation reported during the reference period . self - harm was the subject of two reviewed articles [ 61 , 62 ] . sansone et al .   found that a history of domestic violence was a statistically significant predictor of bodily self - harm in their study of psychiatric inpatients in the usa . a qualitative study of self - harm in victims of intimate partner violence in china   revealed that victims considered self - harm to be a method for airing painful emotions caused by abuse , or a last resort to escape by dying when they saw no other option and were no longer able to endure the violence . the general categories of self - perceived mental health and psychological distress were utilized in nineteen studies . these studies used a range of measurement instruments to report on generalized mental health status and functioning . the medical outcomes study 36-item short form health survey ( sf-36 ) mental health component score was used in five studies [ 16 , 19 , 31 , 63 , 64 ] and the shorter sf-12 form in two other studies [ 65 , 66 ] . other tools used to measure self - reported mental health status were the who developed self - reporting questionnaire ( srq-20 ) used in three studies [ 45 , 57 , 60 ] , the 12-item general health questionnaire ( ghq-12 ) used in three studies [ 8 , 12 , 67 ] and a development of author 's own questions [ 13 , 38 ] or the use of a range of questions extracted from several survey instruments . a consistent finding of all these studies is that women who had experienced ipv ( physical , sexual , or psychological ) had lower mental health and social functioning scores than women who had not experienced ipv . .   reported on data from a us population - based survey using the kessler-6 ( k6 ) instrument to measure the degree of serious psychological distress ( spd ) experienced in the last thirty days . the risk of spd was highest among women who reported experiencing both physical and sexual ipv during their lifetime , the prevalence of spd for this group of women was 15.4% . among women with no lifetime history of ipv , the prevalence of serious psychological distress was 2.1% . in a canadian study on ipv in young couples , fortin et al . it was found for women in the study that a history of psychological violence gave a significant prediction of distress ; however , there was no significant prediction of distress in women experiencing physical abuse . it should be noted , however , that the reported prevalence rate of psychological abuse for women in this study ( 80% ) was much higher than the reported rate for physical violence ( 27% ) .   amongst the reviewed articles , four studies [ 11 , 7072 ] focused solely on sleep disturbance as a consequence of intimate partner violence and several others [ 13 , 39 , 41 , 50 ] reported on insomnia and other sleep disturbances in the context of broader physical or mental health outcomes . all of the sleep studies support the finding that intimate partner violence has the capacity to impact negatively on both the quality and quantity of sleep in women with experience of ipv . the main mediating pathways between intimate partner violence and poor sleep were reported as depression [ 11 , 70 ] and ptsd . a qualitative study , reporting on a british focus groups of survivors of partner abuse , highlights the dangers of living with a perpetrator of violence and the impacts that this had on their sleep habits . the women stated that being asleep while the perpetrator was awake was seen as extremely risky . for some male perpetrators , their female partner being asleep was sufficient reason for violence , and for others enforcing sleep deprivation was another method of control . living with a constant anticipation of violence meant that these women felt that they needed to remain vigilant at all times . this could continue long after separation from their violent partner , in some cases 5 or 6 years earlier . as well as disturbed and little sleep , women from the focus group reported problems of aching limbs or teeth grinding , which they related to  sleeping tightly  following the abuse . there were also recurrent bad dreams , including hearing or seeing their ex - partner . most of the women reported that they had spent considerable periods of time with the quality and quantity of their sleep restricted , and they felt the impact on their health and wellbeing had been significant . the authors concede that it is difficult to make direct links between the women 's lack of sleep and physical problems , but the women all felt that their lack of sleep had led to a range of physical health problems . symptoms reported included being  run down  ; aching all over ; having migraines and/or headaches , raised blood pressure , chronic fatigue and digestive problems ; being more susceptible to other illnesses , such as flu . sleep deprivation was also reported to dramatically reduce the women 's  ability to cope  with the violence they were experiencing .   for the purpose of this review , a study was considered to report functional physical health if it reported on measures of physical functioning and role limitation from the medical outcomes study 36-item short form health survey ( sf-36 ) [ 16 , 19 , 63 , 64 ] or the shorter 12-item version ( sf-12 ) [ 65 , 66 , 73 ] measures , the patient health questionnaire tool ( phq-15 ) tool   or studies that incorporated their own questions relating to physical health function , injury and illness disability , and difficulty walking or in performing daily activities [ 57 , 60 ] . all of the above - mentioned scales are validated tools for measuring physical health . for all but two of the reviewed studies , women with a history of ipv had significantly lower levels of physical functioning than either nonabused women within the same study , or the female national norm value for health function scores . two studies did not report an association between ipv and functional physical health . in the first , results from a us study by chen et al .   still showed this trend ; however , the differences were not statistically significant . the second study , by helfrich et al .   reported that there were no significant differences between their study sample of women from a domestic violence shelter and national norm data on physical symptoms or the effects of those symptoms on function . detailed data on the physical function of their sample of abused women was not provided in the reviewed article . recovery of physical health function after leaving an abusive partner was the subject of one review study . in this norwegian study , when women were resurveyed 12 months after leaving an abusive partner , it was found that all the sf-36 quality of life domains relating to physical health of the abused women were still significantly lower than the norwegian female national population of the same age . this suggests that physical functioning levels of abused women are still significantly affected , even after 12 months away from their abusive partners . self - perceived physical health status , as reported by participants , was included as a health indicator in eight of the reviewed studies . self - perceived poor health status was significantly associated with intimate partner violence in seven of these studies [ 17 , 26 , 33 , 38 , 60 , 66 , 67 ] . as well as physical abuse , nonphysical forms of violence in the form of emotional [ 60 , 67 ] and psychological [ 38 , 66 ] abuse were also implicated with lowered levels of perceived physical health . the only study reporting no significant association between the presence of partner violence and lowered levels of reported physical health was chen et al . , as mentioned previously . a history of ipv has been frequently reported to be associated with a range of chronic health conditions . of the studies included in this review , seventeen studies included consideration of what have been categorized as chronic conditions . these studies and chronic pain was reported as being significantly associated with a history of ipv in nine reviewed studies [ 8 , 33 , 34 , 41 , 47 , 53 , 56 , 74 , 75 ] and investigated , but reported as nonsignificant in four additional studies [ 19 , 26 , 60 , 76 ] . .   reported that pain had one of the highest associations with ipv of all the studied physical symptoms . in a canadian study of wuest et al . , 35% of the surveyed women reported experiencing high levels of disabling pain even though they had been separated from abusive partners for an average of 20 months . this was significantly higher than the reported canadian national level of 18% of women reporting debilitating pain . on average , women from the study reported experiencing pain in more than three sites and the authors particularly noted the high prevalence of women ( 43.2% ) reporting swollen and painful joints . other studies have reported pain as an ongoing health problem for women with a history of ipv , experienced as chronic back ache [ 8 , 56 ] , neck pain , stomach cramps [ 41 , 56 ] , and chronic headache . the use of pain medication by women with a history of ipv has been reported by several studies [ 17 , 53 , 60 ] . with significantly higher rates of reported chronic pain amongst ipv survivors , it would be expected that the use of analgesics would also be significantly higher amongst these women . however , this was not the case observed in two of the three reviewed studies that dealt specifically with pain medication . .   found no association between ipv and the use of pain medication , but this study also reported no significant increase in the level of pain reported by the abused women in their japanese population - based sample that was part of the who multi - country study . this finding is contrary to the previously mentioned study of wuest et al .   which found significantly higher pain levels in their community based study sample . wuest et al . , in an allied study on medication use , reported that even though this sample of abused women reported high levels of back pain , headaches , and swollen painful joints , they were less likely to be taking over - the - counter nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) and analgesics , and no more likely to be taking opioids than canadian women in general , even though the incidence of chronic pain was significantly higher . other chronic health problems that have been associated with the experience of partner violence include cardiovascular and/or circulatory problems ( including heart attack , heart disease , hypertension , thrombosis , and stroke ) [ 8 , 43 , 67 , 74 , 77 ] ; fatigue , allergies and hearing and sight problems ; respiratory problems ( including asthma , emphysema , and bronchitis ) [ 42 , 74 , 77 ] ; bone and muscle conditions ( including osteoporosis , arthritis , and other joint problems ) [ 53 , 56 , 74 , 75 ] ; diabetes [ 67 , 74 , 77 ] ; low iron [ 74 , 78 ] ; malnutrition and low weight   and gastrointestinal conditions [ 26 , 56 , 74 ] . somatoform disorders and psychosomatic complaints were reported in four studies [ 14 , 33 , 40 , 41 ] . scheffer lingren and renck report that the women interviewed in their swedish study suffered various physical symptoms as a result of psychological abuse , including weight loss , weight gain , stomach pain , and pains in  every bone of my body  . avdibegovi and sinanovi   also reported a higher incidence of symptoms of somatization among women victims of all categories of ipv in bosnia and herzegovina . in a norwegian study , nerien and schei   reported that psychosomatic complaints were more common among women reporting partner violence , with 28% of abused women reporting these complaints compared to 14% of nonabused women . the complaints reported included stomach pain , headache , dizziness , and muscular pain . gynaecological symptoms were reported to be associated with a history of intimate partner violence by women in studies from both developing nations [ 57 , 79 ] and developed countries [ 33 , 56 , 73 , 74 ] . a study by stephenson et al .   found that gynaecological symptoms were significantly related to the reporting of sexual violence , the most common symptom being bleeding after sexual intercourse during times other than menstruation , followed by abnormal vaginal discharge , pain or burning during urination , and pain during intercourse . the incidence of abnormal pap smear results and higher rates of cervical cancer have also been positively associated with a history of ipv [ 46 , 74 ] , as has the occurrence of sexually transmissible infections ( other than hiv / aids ) [ 43 , 46 , 80 ] . among the reviewed articles , three studies dealt specifically with the association of intimate partner abuse with hiv / aids [ 8082 ] . in the population - based rwandan study conducted by dude , it was found that women who experienced any type of ipv were more likely to report non - hiv stis , but women who had specifically experienced sexual and emotional abuse were more likely to test positive for hiv compared to nonabused women . conducted a two - year study to follow the incidence of new cases of hiv infection among rural south african women . there were a statistically significant higher number of hiv cases reported by women with a history of partner violence ( physical or sexual ipv ) compared to nonabused women . this was the case both at baseline and also for the newly acquired cases of hiv observed throughout the study period . the hiv risk associated with being in a violent intimate relationship was investigated by josephs and abel   in a community - based sample of african - american women . they reported that , in their study sample , there was a high correlation between the frequency of physical abuse and sexual coercion . they also showed that violence perpetrated against women by their intimate partners impacted negatively on the women 's sexual decision - making and free choice , including the ability to negotiate condom use . the who multi - country study on women 's health and domestic violence against women is a broad ranging study of the prevalence and health impact of ipv , commissioned by the who in 1997 . it involved the collection of data from over 24,000 women at fifteen sites in ten countries : bangladesh , brazil , ethiopia , japan , namibia , peru , samoa , serbia and montenegro , thailand , and the united republic of tanzania . memory loss , problems with concentration , and dizziness were screened for in the world health organization questionnaires . memory loss and problems with concentration were significantly associated with lifetime experiences of partner violence across all study sites in the who multi - country study   as well as in japan   and vietnam . dizziness was also reported as a condition associated with ipv history across several individual studies [ 33 , 56 , 57 ] along with reported neurological complaints . this review has added to current literature by identifying those areas of health most consistently related to experiences of ipv across a wide range of samples , cultures , and ages . by systematically identifying relevant articles and synthesizing the results , it is possible to see that women who have lived with violent partners are more likely than other women to experience a range of psychological and physical symptoms and illnesses , particularly depression , ptsd , anxiety , suicidal ideation , self - harm , insomnia , pain , respiratory conditions , musculoskeletal conditions , cardiovascular disorders , diabetes , and gastrointestinal symptoms . in addition , generally speaking , the more severe and/or the more frequent the experience of ipv , the more severe the symptomatology appears to be , suggesting a dose - response relationship between ipv and depression , ptsd , anxiety , and suicidal ideation . the inclusion of papers from a range of settings has allowed a broad picture of health outcomes and ipv prevalence to be drawn . clinical settings , by the nature of the participants , can be expected to report elevated rates of health problems , but the fact that extensive health problems were also consistently reported from a wide range of community and population - based studies attests to the generalisability of results . studies conducted in health care settings also tended to report higher prevalence rates of ipv than population - based samples . however , many population - based studies had rates of ipv equivalent to or higher than any of the clinical samples , especially those reported from some developing countries within the who studies . the scope of papers included within the review could , thus , be seen to reflect a wide range of contexts for ipv , thus portraying a picture of ipv that expands beyond the possible biases of individual study contexts . despite the differences in the ways that ipv and health issues were measured and the inclusion of papers that utilised population , shelter and clinical samples from a wide range of cultures , the consistency of findings gives credence to the position that ipv represents a major health and human rights issue . the findings from multi - country studies using standardized questionnaires , as in the two rounds of the who multi - country studies as well as standardized modules in the demographic and health surveys ( dhs ) by many national governments in asia , africa , and south america provide similar findings [ 4 , 5 ] . in almost every country in the world , violence against women is considered a legal crime , yet women may be subject to ipv for many years . there are many reasons why women might remain in violent relationships , including fear , lack of access to legal recourse , lack of resources , cultural norms , and proscription among many others . this review supports the notion that ending violence might lead to increased health and wellbeing , at least for measured scales of vitality and physical function ; however , even with this improvement , women with a history of abuse still reported health levels below the national average . however , health deficits related to ipv were also found to last for many years , particularly for psychological conditions such as anxiety , depression , ptsd , and sleep disorders . for other health issues , whilst there are methodological limitations in inferring causality from cross - sectional data , the literature on association of ipv and poor health now includes a range of methodological enquiries including longitudinal studies . the presence of a number of longitudinal studies within this review lends a broader perspective to the issue of ipv across the lifespan and helps strengthen confidence in the applicability of findings from cross - sectional studies . longitudinal studies have indicated similar trends in health outcomes to those found in cross - sectional studies , and this concurrence in findings across methods is striking and provides considerable evidence to support the thesis that a history of ipv precedes poor mental health outcomes that may persist even after the violence has ended . in the current review , eight studies were longitudinal and these allowed for temporal pathways to be shown between ipv and somatic symptoms , poor sleep patterns , hiv infection , and aspects of mental health including depression , anxiety , and ptsd . less is known about other conditions and this demonstrates a serious gap in the literature . similarly , results for poor physical health outcomes were consistent across methods . in almost all of the available studies , women 's functional health status was poorer and chronic health problems more prevalent compared with other women . these findings point to chronic physical disease mediated through high levels of stress , reduced practice of healthy behaviours , and limited agency in deciding on lifestyle choices . the reported findings from the included qualitative research adds a richness and a personal perspective to the understanding of the experiences of women who have had to live with intimate partner violence . firstly , there is a known bias towards publication of papers that show significant results rather than those that support the null hypothesis . the current review relied upon published papers , so the degree of contrary evidence , where perhaps results did not show associations between ipv and health is not known . however , the consistency within studies that measured more than one facet of health and the consistency in findings between studies offers strong evidence supporting associations between ipv and poorer health . causal implications can not be made from any of the studies examined , although some temporal associations have been found . again , the review offers a weight of evidence that points to a large population of women who are experiencing poorer health associated with and consequential to ipv . this review utilized three large electronic databases to search for relevant articles for inclusion ; however , it is acknowledged that other relevant papers , particularly  grey literature ,  may have been missed in this search process . the limiting of the review to english - language - based articles may also have excluded some pertinent papers , especially publications from developing countries which may be more likely to be published in local languages and languages other than english , this is recognized as a limitation to the review process . the findings of studies included in the present review show that women with a history of ipv experience significantly poorer health including depression , anxiety , ptsd , and reduced measures in both functional and somatic physical health domains . the review also highlighted the need for more methodological clarity in future studies on a number of issues . these include availability of more data on the long - term mental and physical health consequences following ipv through longitudinal studies using standardised definitions and validated scales . there is also a need to better understand the long - term implications of ( a ) different forms of ipv , ( b ) the cumulative impact of experiencing multiple types of ipv , and ( c ) cumulative intensity / severity of ipv . the availability of high - quality cross - cultural qualitative research studies on women 's subjective experiences is also of value to allow better triangulation of the data on ipv and adverse health impacts . future studies also need to focus on the pathways to recovery from abusive experiences and how health services , particularly primary care clinicians , can play a role in this rehabilitative journey . despite these gaps in current knowledge , it is clear that ipv has serious and long lasting detrimental consequences for women 's health and wellbeing . the accumulated findings of the papers within this review underscore the classification of ipv as a public health problem as well as a legal and social issue .","associations between intimate partner violence ( ipv ) and poor physical and mental health of women have been demonstrated in the international and national literature across numerous studies . 
 this paper presents a review of the literature on this topic . 
 the 75 papers included in this review cover both original research studies and those which undertook secondary analyses of primary data sources . 
 the reviewed research papers published from 2006 to 2012 include quantitative and qualitative studies from western and developing countries . 
 the results show that while there is variation in prevalence of ipv across various cultural settings , ipv was associated with a range of mental health issues including depression , ptsd , anxiety , self - harm , and sleep disorders . in most studies , these effects were observed using validated measurement tools . 
 ipv was also found to be associated with poor physical health including poor functional health , somatic disorders , chronic disorders and chronic pain , gynaecological problems , and increased risk of stis .

"modern high - dose - rate brachytherapy ( hdr - bt ) of prostate cancer enables the delivery of a very high single or multiple dose of radiation to the target volume ( e.g. prostate capsule ) and , at the same time , preventing the organs at risk from unnecessary radiation ( e.g. urethra and rectal wall ) [ 13 ] . the 3d reconstruction of ultrasound image series is used for prospective treatment planning which is based on dose volume parameters . there are certain dose volume constraints for target coverage and dose limits in oars [ 4 , 5 ] . furthermore , there is some evidence that dose values in treated volume are dependent on different factors such as prostate volume , location of urethra and number of inserted applicators [ 69 ] . amongst the large number of prostate cancer patients there is a group that is suitable for combined treatment of external beam radiotherapy ( ebrt ) and preceded or followed by hdr - bt . the feasibility and efficacy of such approach in localized prostate cancer has been already proven [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] . combination of ebrt with hdr - bt boost is found to be effective and related to comparatively low incidence of side effects [ 4 , 1113 ] . it was noticed during clinical practice in the department that the final outcome of consecutive hdr - bt treatment plans optimization was connected , to some extent , to e.g. prostate volume or number of needles used for the implant . a question has been posed about the nature of this observation and whether it could be related to other prostate cancer prognostic factors . the aim of this study was to determine the relation between dose - volume parameters ( in the prostate and oars ) obtained from hdr - bt treatment plans and particular prostate cancer prognostic factors along with prostate volume and the number of implanted needles . in the study , high - dose - rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer was introduced to the brachytherapy department in greater poland cancer centre in july 2006 . since that time till july 2007 , the number of 190 patients ( age 52 - 81 , median 68 years ) with localized prostate cancer ( t1 - 30n0m0 ) has been treated with interstitial iridium-192 ( i ) hdr - bt ( table 1 ) . all patients were treated with combination of external beam radiotherapy . according to the institutional protocol , dose of 50 gy ( dose fraction of 2 gy ) was initially administered to the prostate and pelvis ( in case of high risk of nodal involvement ) . intensity modulated radiotherapy ( imrt ) or 3-dimentional conformal radiotherapy ( 3dcrt ) techniques were used . after 2 - 4 weeks patients were admitted for 48 hour in - ward stay to be boosted with hdr - bt . to all men , dose of 15 gy boost to ctv1 ( encompassed by prostate capsule ) patients characteristics ( n = 190 ) in 3 cases treated volume exceeded recommended 60 cc and achieved 81 up to 87 cc abbreviations : i - psa  initial level of prostate specific antigen , ns  not specified , gs  gleason score swift system ( nucletron ) for hdr brachytherapy of prostate cancer example of hdr brachytherapy of prostate cancer ( swift ) ; templates , steel needles and connection cables visible prognostic factors such as age , staging , gleason score , initial psa level , and prostate volume ( based on transrectal ultrasound examination ) were assessed before the procedure . real - time intraoperative treatment planning software ( nucletron b. v. , swift ) was used in order to incorporate blind inverse planning optimization and is complementary to microselectron hdr remote afterloader ( nucletron b. v. , veenendaal , the netherlands ) ( fig . 2 ) . this system enables the operator to acquire series of ultrasound images , offers real - time visualization of the needle placement , display 2d and 3d volumes for 3d planning as well as gives the opportunity to optimize a conformal treatment plan and to generate the dose volume parameters with dose volume histogram ( dvh ) . dose volume parameters were determined as follows : dmin ( minimal dose ) , dmax ( maximal dose ) , dmean ( mean dose ) , d90 ( the percentage of reference dose [ dref ] delivered to 90% of treated volume ) , v100 , v150 , v200 ( the volume of the target receiving 100% , 150% and 200% of reference dose , respectively ) for prostate ; dmin , dmax , dmean , d10 ( the percentage of the reference dose delivered to 10% of oar volume ) and v100 for urethra and rectum ( oars ) , respectively ( fig . treatment plan , dose volume parameters and dose volume histogram ( dvh ) from swift planning system as it is accepted in our department , the aim of each good quality implant is to deliver more than 90% of prescribed dose to at least 90% of target volume ( d90 > 90% ) . dose volume limitation of oars such as urethral d10 < 120% and rectal d10 < 75% were taken into account during treatment plan optimization . once the data was collected , the dose volume parameters were correlated with prognostic factors , prostate volume and number of needles used for particular implant . firstly , prognostic factors were correlated with actual prognostic factors , followed by dose - volume parameters for the prostate , urethra and anterior rectal wall , respectively . secondly , prostatic dose - volume parameters were correlated with dose - volume parameters for urethra and , separately , for the anterior rectal wall . all findings obtained from the calculation were taken into consideration only in case of attaining significant level of p - value < 0.05 ( table 3 ) . investigated parameters and the way of correlation prognostic factors vs. prognostic factors prognostic factors vs. prostatic dvh parameters prognostic factors vs. urethral dvh parameters prognostic factors vs. rectal dvh parameters prostatic dvh parameters vs. urethral dvh parameters prostatic dvh parameters vs. rectal dvh parameters abbreviations : dvh  dose volume histogram , t  tumor stage according to tnm classification , i - psa  initial level of prostate specific antigen ( before treatment ) , dmin  minimal dose in treated volume , dmax maximal dose in treated volume , dm  mean dose , d90  the percentage of prescribed dose delivered to 90% of treated volume , d10  the percentage of the organ at risk receiving 10% of prescribed dose ;

v100 , v200  the percentage of treated volume receiving 100 and 200% of prescribed dose , respectively demanes et al .   reported excellent target coverage with d90 between 105% and 113% of the prescribed dose , kini et al . some of our treatment plans were suboptimal , although the high single dose of 15 gy was prescribed to ctv1 ( prostate capsule ) in contrast to ctv2 ( peripheral zone ) [ 4 , 15 ] or ctv3 ( tumor volume ) . it appears that differences came from various descriptions of the target and the method of 100% prescribed isodose normalization . furthermore , the data is derived from the first set of implants used in the department which is also the cause of worse results . in the first year after introducing the procedure , the implantation technique has improved , in concordance with lee et al .   and merric et al .   who have reported their data about learning curve . the study results indicate that in the group of older patients one can expect relatively more difficulties in achieving good quality implants . it is due to the fact that older patients are more likely to be diagnosed with lower t stage , which results in smaller volume of the prostate . [ 7 , 8 ] did not find significant correlation between the prostate volume and the number of needles implanted , but patients with 11 needles or less tended to develop higher grade genitourinary ( gu ) toxicity as compared with those with 12 needles or more . the gu toxicity was increased due to more inhomogenic dose distribution and hot spots as a result of small number of implanted needles . this finding corresponds with our study , which show statistically significant relationship between small numbers of implanted needles and lower prostatic dmin , d90 and v100 , higher prostatic dmean and v200 as well as lower urethral dmin , dmean , v100 and higher dmax . the usage of small number of needles was intentional approach of kovcs et al . . he prescribed reference dose of 15 gy to peripheral zone of the prostate ( ctv2 ) with critical structures covered by low - dose areas and neglecting , to some extent , the total dose covering of the prostate . furthermore , borghede et al .   focused on the tumor volume ( ctv3 ) that was defined within the prostate gland . as per duchesne et al . , it is essential to limit the level of v200 to 15% of the target , in order to decrease the risk of late gu morbidity . this can be achieved in relatively large prostate glands , implanted with greater number of needles ; based on our study and published data [ 1 , 2 , 14 ] . in addition , to improve treatment plan prepared for good implant it is advisable to use anatomy - based inverse optimization tools instead of e. g. geometrical ones [ 5 , 20 , 21 ] . till date , no data was found regarding minimal prostate volume that should not be implanted and the smallest number of applicators to be used without compromising dose distribution , as well as acceptable incidence of side effects and satisfactory outcome . in conclusion , statistical analysis revealed significant correlation between age , t stage , prostate volume and number of needles used for the implant and increased prostatic d90 and v100 , decreased v200 . amongst prognostic factors no relationship was found between any prognostic factor and rectal wall dvh parameters . in other words , increased prostate volume with improved d90 and larger number of implanted needles results in better target coverage ( higher value of v100 ) , better dose distribution ( less hot - spots with lower value of v200 ) and decreased dose delivered to the urethra ( lower urethral d10 and dmax ) . further investigation with close follow - up should give an answer whether the above arguments corresponds with morbidity and outcome .","purposecertain constraints for target coverage and dose limits in organs at risk ( oars ) shows some evidence that doses values and homogeneity index in treated volume depends on prognostic factors such as prostate volume , location of urethra and the number of inserted applicators . 
 our study is to determine the relation between values of the doses in prostate , oars and particular prognostic factors related to hdr - bt of prostate cancer.material and methodsthe amount of 190 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated with interstitial hdr - bt between july 2006 and july 2007 . 
 the hdr - bt was administered as a boost for previously delivered 50 gy dose from external beam radiotherapy . 
 dose volume parameters were determined such as : dmin , dmax , dmean , d90 , v100 , v150 and v200 for prostate and dmin , dmax , dmean , d10 and v100 for urethra and rectum ( oars ) , respectively . 
 these parameters were correlated with prognostic factors such as : age , staging ( tnm ) , gleason score , initial psa level ( i - psa ) , number of needles and volume of the prostate.resultsthe mean value of d90 was 91.3% , range 65.9 - 102.8% . 
 mean urethral d10 was 121 , 8% , range 78.8 - 152.9% . 
 mean rectal d10 was 81.3% , range 37.4 - 101.0% . 
 statistically significant relationship was found between staging ( tnm ) , prostate volume , and the number of needles used for implant and increased prostate d90 and decreased v200 . 
 the prognostic factor was only the age which was related to increased urethral d10 and dmax . 
 no correlation was found between any prognostic factor and rectal wall dvh parameters.conclusionsincreased prostate volume with improved d90 and greater number of implanted needles results in better target coverage ( higher v100 ) , better dose distribution ( lower v200 ) and decreased dose delivered to the urethra ( lower urethral d10 , dmax ) , with no evident influence on rectal wall . 
 further investigation with closed follow - up should give an answer whether the above corresponds with morbidity and outcome .",480
"in early november 2001 , a 57-year - old female laboratory worker ( laboratory worker 1 ) began experiencing nonspecific symptoms of malaise , vomiting , headache , lower leg cramping , anorexia , and fever . one week after onset of symptoms , she was evaluated for severe headaches at a local emergency room , where cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) and blood cultures were collected . small , gram - positive bacilli were isolated and characterized as coryneform bacilli , which are usually interpreted as contaminants of unknown clinical importance . despite multiple hospital admissions , approximately 5 weeks after symptom onset , colleagues from the hospital microbiology laboratory where she was employed ( laboratory 1 ) drew her blood for culture again . after 5 days of incubation , gram - variable coccobacilli , the brucella serum agglutination test ( sat ) was reactive ( 1:640 ) at the nysdoh laboratory , wadsworth center . laboratory worker 1 was initially treated with doxycycline and gentamicin , followed by doxycycline and rifampin , for 6 weeks of outpatient therapy . the isolate was later identified as b. melitensis by the wadsworth center and confirmed by the centers for disease control and prevention . the patient has not relapsed 18 months after completing treatment . in a second incident in mid - january 2002 , a 48-year - old woman had nocturnal temperature spikes to 40c , chills , drenching sweats , and weight loss . symptoms persisted , and uveitis developed . in early march 2002 , a diffuse , erythematous rash appeared on the anterior aspect of both legs . a blood culture and serologic tests for lyme disease , ehrlichiosis , and rocky mountain spotted fever ( rmsf ) were performed . from the blood culture , gram - positive cocci were isolated and identified as micrococcus spp . by a commercial laboratory . rmsf titers were immunoglobulin ( ig ) m - negative with a reactive igg of 1:256 . subsequently , she was referred to an infectious disease specialist , who found repeat rmsf titers unchanged , which made acute rmsf unlikely . when interviewed by nysdoh staff , the patient reported that she was a laboratory worker ( laboratory worker 2 ) at laboratory 2 . her initial blood culture specimen , which had originally been identified as micrococcus , was reassessed by the commercial laboratory . the commercial laboratory referred the original isolate to the wadsworth center , where the isolate was identified as b. melitensis . . they denied traveling outside of the united states , consuming imported or domestic unpasteurized dairy products , knowing ill family or friends who may have traveled , attending events with potentially contaminated foods , or handling farm or laboratory animals . both laboratory workers denied any accidental contamination or spills in the laboratory during the 6 months before their respective illnesses . site visits to laboratories 1 and 2 were conducted by nysdoh . on the open bench at laboratory 1 a syringe was used to directly plate contents of the blood culture media bottle onto agar . subsequent biochemical tests , including a catalase test , which may generate aerosols by introducing hydrogen peroxide to the specimen , were performed on the open laboratory bench . at laboratory 2 , subculturing occurred in a similar manner , but it took place in a class ii biosafety cabinet . however , biochemical tests were performed on the open laboratory bench when gram stain results indicated that spores were not present . laboratory workers 1 and 2 wore gloves when processing specimens , and both denied having dermatitis or skin lesions on their hands . after the diagnosis of brucellosis in these two laboratory workers , serum samples from their co - workers from laboratories 1 and 2 were tested by brucella sat ; samples from seven of eight co - workers were nonreactive ( < 1:20 ) . a co - worker of laboratory worker 1 had an initial agglutination titer of 1:40 ( indeterminate ) and 1 month later had a repeat titer of < 1:20 ; she denied having symptoms . to determine the source of these laboratory workers ' infections , each laboratory reviewed gram stains of blood culture specimens processed within 3 to 6 months of symptom onset . laboratory worker 2 reviewed prior gram stain slides from laboratory 2 and identified one slide containing a questionable coryneform bacillus . this blood culture had been drawn from laboratory worker 1 during her visit to the emergency room of laboratory worker 2 's hospital , early in november 2001 . approximately 2 months before her illness , laboratory worker 2 had personally processed laboratory worker 1 's blood culture but had characterized the isolate as coryneform bacilli . wadsworth center staff reviewed the original gram stain from laboratory worker 1 's blood culture specimen and noted gram - variable organisms with similar size and shape to brucella organisms . however , laboratory worker 2 did not identify any other gram stains that resembled brucella organisms during the period before her illness . the likely source of laboratory worker 1 's infection was found after reassessing gram stains performed in laboratory 1 in august , september , and october 2001 . a 76-year - old woman visited the emergency room served by laboratory 1 in early september 2001 . the patient had had fever ( temperature 38.3c ) for 1 day and headache for 3 weeks . she received one dose of ciprofloxacin for a possible urinary tract infection and was discharged . after 4 days of incubation , a gram stain of this patient 's blood culture specimen showed tiny , gram - negative coccobacilli , reported as coryneform bacilli . as part of the investigation for the source of infection for laboratory worker 1 , this patient 's prepared gram stain slide was referred to the wadsworth center , where small , gram - variable cocci were identified . more than 1 year after being seen in the emergency room , this patient was offered brucella sat and a repeat blood culture . she refused brucella sat , and her physician did not identify symptoms consistent with brucellosis . six months after this identification , further experimental analysis by the wadsworth center with polymerase chain reaction tests performed on gram stain material detected b. melitensis dna ( wadsworth center , nysdoh , unpub . the patient was again contacted , and brucella sat ( > 1.5 years after her initial blood culture ) showed a titer of 1:80 ( indeterminate ) . , the patient denied any visits outside the united states since 1989 , when she emigrated from peru . although brucellosis is a rare disease in the united states , its potential use as a bioweapon highlights the need for accurate and rapid identification ( 15 ) . in this investigation , brucellosis was diagnosed weeks to years after initial positive blood cultures were misidentified , and laboratory personnel were unknowingly exposed to the organism . this investigation suggests that transmission occurred from the 76-year - old index patient to laboratory worker 1 , on the basis of b. melitensis dna found in the gram stain material . processing the index patient 's blood culture specimen on an open laboratory bench was most likely the reason for laboratory worker 1 's illness approximately 5 weeks later . the same mechanism of transmission probably occurred when laboratory worker 2 handled laboratory worker 1 's blood culture specimen on the open bench for biochemical testing . in these instances , blood culture bottle media were transferred to slides and agar without much risk for aerosolization , since contents were manipulated with a syringe . biochemical tests , however , included the catalase test , which creates bubbles as a result of exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide in positive specimens . neither laboratory worker could identify any other possible sources of infection , and because brucellosis is a rare disease in new york , the connection between these three patients is plausible . with the initial interpretations of these gram stains as gram - variable , which resulted in misidentification of the organism by three different laboratories , nysdoh initiated an effort to educate clinical laboratories in new york state about the potential difficulties in characterizing the organism and the importance of primary gram stain interpretation . additional investigation into the staining properties of brucella spp . under various conditions is now in progress and may help differentiate brucella spp . from other organisms . because of immigration and foreign travel , brucellosis remains an occupational hazard for laboratory personnel , even in industrialized countries where animal control efforts have virtually eliminated the disease . because of the nonspecific symptoms and the rarity of the disease in the united states , healthcare providers may not consider brucellosis in a differential diagnosis . . moreover , improved communication among healthcare providers and laboratory personnel should facilitate prompt and accurate identification and appropriate handling of the organism . its potential use as a bioweapon necessitates that healthcare providers , as well as microbiologists in hospitals and commercial laboratories , be knowledgeable about the diagnosis , identification , and handling of brucella spp . reporting brucellosis cases to public health officials is another component in protecting others from this disease . public health officials should notify laboratory personnel who may have handled cultures taken from patients ultimately diagnosed with brucellosis . early notification of exposed personnel could lead to their timely diagnosis and treatment , should symptoms occur , and could prevent further laboratory exposures .","we report two laboratory - acquired brucella melitensis infections that were shown to be epidemiologically related . 
 blood culture isolates were initially misidentified because of variable gram stain results , which led to misdiagnoses and subsequent laboratory exposures . 
 notifying laboratory personnel who unknowingly processed cultures from brucellosis patients is an important preventive measure .",69
"ultrasound - guided fine - needle aspiration ( fna ) has become the gold standard for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules due to the suboptimal accuracy using gray scale features alone . besides for mild associated pain , development of postprocedural hematoma has been reported from 1.9% to 6.4% , with seven reported cases of life - threatening hematomas relating to airway obstruction . the true rate of complications following thyroid nodule fna is likely much higher though as most go undocumented and unpublished . although fna plays an essential role in thyroid nodule evaluation , the potential for a nondiagnostic ( nd ) specimen can lead to repeat procedures , increasing patient morbidity , cost , chance for complication , and delay in diagnosis . recently , thyroid nodule fna pathological reporting has been standardized based on the bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology adopted by the american society for clinical pathology ( ascp ) . based on their criteria , an adequate specimen needs to contain at least six groups of follicular cells with each group composed of at least 10 cells each . an nd specimen can be secondary to obscuring blood , overlying thick smears , air drying of alcohol - fixed smears , or inadequate number of follicular cells . according to the ascp , nd specimens occur in 2%20% of cases but ideally should be limited to no more than 10% of all thyroid nodule fnas . recently , the use of ultrasound strain elastography ( use ) has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid . a novel approach aimed at decreasing the rate of nd nodule fna maybe to use elastography as a map , targeting biopsy needles to areas of lower strain ( i.e. , stiffer ) . several papers have been published illustrating increased detection of prostate cancer using use - targeted interventions through a transrectal approach . our study was performed to evaluate the role of use - targeted fna in decreasing the rates of nd aspirates . we performed a review of all thyroid nodule fna performed over a 3-year period comparing fna results when an elastogram was available before fna or not . our hypothesis is that the presence of an elastogram before fna would decrease the rate of nd specimens . the study was health insurance portability and accountability compliant , and informed consent was waived . between january 2011 and january 2014 , a total of 225 patients underwent ultrasound - guided thyroid nodule fna . among them were 171 females and 54 males with ages ranging from 27 to 90 . the demographical data recorded included patients ' age and gender as well as which thyroid lobe contained the nodule biopsied [ table 1 ] . gray scale nodule characteristics that were recorded included the presence of microcalcifications , vascularity , solid components , and nodule size [ table 1 ] . the decision to perform use was based strictly on suspicious gray scale characteristics , and guidelines set forth by the society of radiologists in ultrasound . patient demographics and nodule characteristics during this period , use for thyroid nodules was performed in cases where the available technician was comfortable and experienced with the elastography software . when elastography was performed , the applied transducer pressure was standardized by a real - time analysis utilizing a scale that was displayed at the right upper corner of the elastogram image [ figure 1 ] . the nodule strain elastogram was displayed using a 256-color mapping scale [ figure 2 ] . the degree of strain was assigned a given color shade utilizing a range from red ( greatest strain , soft ) to green ( intermediate strain ) to blue ( least strain , hardest component ) . real - time applied transducer pressure analyzed by numeric scale displayed at the right upper corner of the elastogram image ( red box ) . nodule strain elastogram is displayed by a 256-color mapping scale with red representing the softest components and blue representing the hardest components . we separated patients into two groups , based if an elastogram was available for the radiologist to review before fna or not . all fna were completed by one of two fellowship - trained radiologists with specialty in ultrasound - guided procedures . a 21-gauge needle was used in every case , and aspiration was aided by a 5-cc syringe . all pathological analyses were performed by one of three board - certified cytopathologists . in all cases , the final pathological diagnosis was reviewed through the institution 's electronic medical record for every case . the chi - square test was used to determine statistically significant variances in the demographic parameters . there was no significant difference between the two groups in demographics ( including gender , age , and which thyroid gland contained the nodule ) as well as nodule characteristics . regarding the specimen adequacy , the total percentage of nd aspirates was 12.2% , slightly higher than the 10% supported by the ascp . in analyzing the two groups , when an elastogram was available before fna , the nd rate was 10% ( 14/140 ) which was in concordance with the ascp recommendations . however , the group without an elastogram available had an nd rate of 16% ( 13/81 ) . however , this difference was not found to be statistically significant , p = 0.205 . thyroid nodules continue to pose a diagnostic dilemma secondary to poor sensitivity and specificity using gray scale features alone . although considered the gold standard for nodule evaluation , fna carries its own risks including patient pain , cost , and possible complications ( although rare ) . the need for repeat fna secondary to nd results can cause further patient harm as well as delay time to treatment and increase patient anxiety . to help increase the rate of adequate specimen recovery , the use of ultrasound to guide fna has become the standard of care . with the assistance of ultrasound - guided fna , the rates of nd specimen aspirates still range up to 20% . in a recent meta - analysis , even the addition of rapid onsite evaluation by a cytopathologist has shown considerable variability in helping to reduce nd rates . ex vivo studies have found that malignant thyroid lesions have a stiffer architecture compared to benign thyroid stroma . first described in 1991 by ophir , tissue stiffness could be measured by applying an external axial stimulus and viewing the associated compressibility . the continued research in elastography has focused on its ability to distinguish benign and malignant lesions by  virtual palpation . several studies have been performed to evaluate the role of elastography in targeting interventions . most papers have focused on ultrasound - guided transrectal biopsies of the prostate gland . using elastograms , small studies have been able to show enhanced detection rates as well as decreasing the number of core specimens required for diagnosis . to date , there has been only one study performed evaluating strain elastography - guided fna of thyroid nodules . in 2013 , yildrim et al . , prospectively analyzed the rates of nd aspirates between specimens obtained from regions of higher strain and lower strain from 96 patients . the authors found a significant improvement in specimen adequacy when aspirates were obtained from regions that demonstrate a stiff elastogram as described previously . our study was aimed at replicating yildrim 's results in a larger patient sample and hoping to show an improved rate of nd aspirates . in our retrospective review , although there was a decreased rate of nd specimens in the group that use was performed ( 16% vs. 10% ) , this was not found to be statistically significant . first of all , we performed a retrospective review , which by its very nature allows for confounding bias . furthermore , although an elastogram was available for the radiologist before fna in the elastography group , we were unable to prove that stiffer regions were actually targeted and aspirated during the procedure . furthermore , it is possible that stiffer regions of nodules were sampled in the group without elastograms even though elastography was not performed . finally , as our study was a retrospective review , the pathologist performing the specimen analysis was not controlled for , leading to possible variability . another possibility exists to explain why the presence of an elastogram prior the fna did not significantly reduce the rate of nd results . our study was predicated on the idea that stiffer regions within nodules would likely decrease nd aspirates as these regions may represent more cellular areas . however , the development of a stiff consistency in many cancers is secondary to a desmoplastic transformation that takes place . this process is composed of activated fibroblasts ( also known as myofibroblasts ) , tumor vessels , inflammatory cells , and extracellular matrix components . activated carcinoma induced fibroblasts , along with other extracellular matrix proteins , comprise a dominant proportion of several carcinomas , including more than 90% of overall tumor mass in pancreatic cancers . it has even been shown that the complex relationship between these components may promote tumor cell growth . it is possible that the stiffer regions within thyroid nodules are more a product of fibroblastic growth than increased cellular density . we were unable to demonstrate a significant difference in thyroid nodule aspirate adequacy between patients who had an elastogram present before fna compared with those without one . these results may be secondary to lack of power , poor study design versus fibroblastic growth as described above . we hope our study raises awareness of the exciting prospect of use - targeted biopsy and springs future studies confirming its potential .","objectives : since 2009 , the rate of nondiagnostic ( nd ) thyroid nodule fine - needle aspiration ( fna ) has ranged from 2% to 20% 
 . a nd result can cause further patient morbidity secondary to repeated procedures and delay in diagnosis . 
 the use of real - time strain elastography ( rte ) in determining nodule malignant risk has gained considerable focus recently . 
 a less studied area where rte may prove beneficial is its role in targeting areas for fna . 
 our hypothesis is that fna performed in concurrence with rte will show a decreased rate of nd results leading to fewer repeated fna.materials and methods : the institutional review board approval was obtained . 
 a retrospective review of all thyroid nodule fna from january 1 , 2011 , to january 1 , 2014 , was performed with review of nodule size , presence of microcalcifications , vascularity , solid components , patient age , and gender . 
 cases were separated based if rte was done before fna or not . 
 pathology reports were reviewed to assess for specimen adequacy . 
 statistical comparison was performed using sas analysis software.results:a total of 221 specimens were reviewed , with rte performed on 140 cases ( 63.4% ) . 
 both groups were similar in demographics and previously described nodule characteristics . 
 the nd rate when rte was not performed was 16% ( 13/68 ) compared to 10% when rte was performed ( 14/126 ) .

"lung transplantation is an established therapeutic option for patients with advanced cystic fibrosis ( cf ) . the success of the first transplant for a patient with cf in 1983   spurred further refinement of the management and selection criteria of patients , leading to significant survival benefit . however , patients with advanced cf present a unique microbiological challenge , with disease characterised by bronchiectasis , severe airflow obstruction , high bacterial loads , and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections [ 46 ] . unsurprisingly , some centres turn down patients on the basis of colonisation with multiresistant bacteria . the most common respiratory pathogen that colonises patients with cf is pseudomonas aeruginosa , with up to 80% of patients being culture - positive for this organism . as the presence of this microorganism has negative prognostic implications , it is disturbing to note that levels of resistance to frontline antipseudomonal agents are very high . the presence of multi- and pan - resistant p. aeruginosa renders methods of single - agent antibiotic susceptibility testing suboptimal . the conventional manner of managing patients who are colonised with these microorganisms is to empirically treat them with combinations of antibiotics in the peritransplant period . unfortunately , an empirical approach might lead to inadequate bactericidal levels and the prescription of antibiotics that antagonise each other . this approach is undesirable , as patients with pan - resistant bacteria have shorter follow - up periods and decreased survival rates after transplant . an alternative approach is to utilise multiple combination bactericidal testing ( mcbt ) , a technique that had previously been used to systematically test bacterial isolates against multiple combinations of antibiotics to determine susceptibility patterns and identify optimal combinations for potential treatment . previous studies have demonstrated that using combinations of antimicrobials may generate higher levels of in vitro bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa   and burkholderia cepacia complex . our centre currently advocates the use of mcbt ( with modified antimicrobial concentrations ) to determine appropriate prophylactic regimens in patients about to undergo lung transplantation for cf and other lung pathologies that are colonised with antibiotic - resistant gram - negative bacteria . to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategy , we undertook a retrospective analysis to compare the rates of posttransplant infection in patients whose peritransplant antimicrobial regimens were determined using the mcbt versus those who had their antibiotics chosen via conventional sensitivity testing . we performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for cf between january 2000 and august 2010 . patients were included in the review if they were colonized pretransplant with p. aeruginosa ( as demonstrated by sequential sputum cultures ) and were excluded if they were colonized with b. cepacia complex . data was collected from patients ' case notes and clinical charts ; looking specifically at incidences of septicaemia at 30 days , posttransplant wound infection at 30 days , empyema at 30 days , all - cause mortality at 30 days , and all - cause mortality at one year . these were mapped against antibiotic resistance , method of sensitivity testing , and choice of antibiotics that were administered . infections were defined by combining positive laboratory culture from tissue source ( blood , surgical wound , and pleural fluid ) with at least two of the following four parameters : tachycardia ( heart rate > 90 beats per minute),hypotension ( systolic blood pressure < 90  mmhg),body temperature < 36c or > 38c , abnormal inflammatory markers ( white cell count < 4  10  cells / l or > 12  10  cells / l , c - reactive protein > 10  mg / l ) . tachycardia ( heart rate > 90 beats per minute ) , hypotension ( systolic blood pressure < 90  mmhg ) , body temperature < 36c or > 38c , abnormal inflammatory markers ( white cell count < 4  10  cells / l or > 12  10  cells / l , c - reactive protein > 10  mg prophylactic antimicrobials were chosen based on disc susceptibility testing using british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy ( bsac ) breakpoints . if sputum was culture positive for pan - resistant p. aeruginosa or recent culture results were unavailable , patients were treated empirically with aztreonam , an antistaphylococcal agent ( either flucloxacillin or clindamycin ) , and metronidazole . patients who did not receive peritransplant antibiotics chosen via the mcbt method were deemed to have received antibiotics using  conventional  means . perioperative antibiotics were continued until the patient was extubated and could demonstrate a good cough , ( two - three days ) to a maximum of seven days . this was used in conjunction with conventional means of choosing peritransplant antibiotics , but , since 2008 , mcbt became the default method for the determination of bactericidal agents for all patients colonised with antibiotic - resistant gram - negative nonfermenters . bactericidal activity was determined by testing at least 12 antimicrobials individually and in combination with each other , leading to 66 different combinations . several morphotypes of p. aeruginosa from at least two pretransplant sputa were selected for testing . each antimicrobial or combination of antimicrobials was tested in isosensitest broth using systemic breakpoint concentrations as specified by the bsac . after 48 hours incubation at 37c , the turbidity of each broth was measured at 620  nm . broths without detectable bacterial growth were subcultured onto blood agar to calculate 99.9% bacterial kill . peritransplant antibiotic regimens were then chosen based on mcbt results and patients ' allergy history . any other gram - negative species ( including nonfermenters and/or enterobacteriaceae ) that may have isolated alongside p. aeruginosa were also tested using the mcbt , and antibiotic cocktails were chosen that showed bactericidal activity against such mixtures of species . our centre used a three - day induction protocol with antithymocyte globulin ( titrated by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood t lymphocytes ) and intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 2  mg / kg . alternatives were used in the context of an international clinical trial ( mycophenolate ) or in cases of ciclosporin intolerance ( tacrolimus was used ) . up to five days of intravenous ciclosporin was given in the context of poor ciclosporin absorption in patients with cf . between january 27 , 2000 and august 23 , 2010 , 163 lung transplants were performed on patients with cf . this number included patients who were previously turned down by other centres on the basis of their microbiology . a total of 129 patients were colonized with p. aeruginosa and not colonized with b. cepacia complex . fifty patients were given antibiotics that were chosen based on the mcbt , and there were 79 patients in the conventional group . our patients were colonized with strains of p. aeruginosa with varying degrees of antibiotic resistance . we defined pan - resistance as resistance to antipseudomonal quinolones , -lactams , aminoglycosides , and colomycin . in this cohort these organisms were resistant to all single agents tested but bactericidal combinations with colomycin and another agent were identified . seventy - one patients were colonised with multiresistant p. aeruginosa , and nine patients were colonised with fully susceptible strains . forty - seven patients were colonised with organisms that were resistant to one or two groups of antimicrobials . figure 1 shows the relative rates of infectious complications after lung transplantation in both groups . two patients ( 4% ) who were given antibiotics based on mcbt developed septicaemia compared to 13 ( 16.5% ) in the conventional group ( p  0.05 ) . the occurrence of gram - negative sepsis was statistically lower in the mcbt group , and p. aeruginosa was responsible for only one case of septicaemia compared with seven in the conventional therapy group ( see table 2 ) . p. aeruginosa was recovered from the posttransplant pleural fluid of one patient ( 2% ) in the mcbt group , as opposed to six ( 7.6% ) in the conventional group ( p = 0.25 ) . there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of surgical wound infection ( 6% in the mcbt group , 3.8% in the conventional group ) . there were no statistically significant differences in all - cause mortality rate at 30 days , with a 10% mortality rate in the mcbt cohort and 6.33% in the conventional group . this lack of statistical significance was replicated in all - cause mortality rate at one year ( 22% in the mcbt group , 19% in the conventional group ) . lung transplantation for cf accounts for approximately one - third of all single sequential lung transplants performed at our centre . the complex microbiology involved in this cohort of patients may lead to anxiety when listing patients with multi- and pan - resistant p. aeruginosa , but this paper demonstrates for the first time that the mcbt may have a significant role in altering posttransplant infective complications for patients with cf . the data indicates that whilst there may not be evidence for an effect on all - cause mortality , patients who had antibiotics chosen using mcbt had lower rates of morbidity . the presence of pleural infection and septicaemia not only negatively impacts the patients ' transplant journey but prolongs the hospital length - of - stay and adds substantial economic burden .   we had excluded patients who were colonised with b. cepacia complex for the purposes of this retrospective analysis . this is due to the tendency of these patients to succumb to overwhelming sepsis with one - year mortality rates of between 50% and 100% [ 18 , 19 ] . our group had also previously noted that infection with burkholderia cenocepacia in particular led to even poorer mortality outcomes .   unfortunately , we were unable to look at exact causes of death ( septicaemia in particular ) in our patient cohort as causes of death were not readily identifiable in all cases . this is a reflection of the wide geographical referral area that is covered by our centre as well as the degree of shared care with referring centres ( covering the north of england , scotland , northern ireland , and the republic of ireland ) . a previous analysis of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for cf at our centre   had identified sepsis as the cause of death in 18 cases ( 26% of all recorded cf transplantation recipient deaths ) . b. cepacia complex was implicated in seven of these cases . in an additional three cases , clinical sepsis prospective studies would play an important role in determining if the use of mcbt can significantly decrease the rate of early mortality due to septicaemia . aaron et al . had compared the efficacy of using antimicrobial combinations derived from mcbt with those derived from conventional susceptibility testing for treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations of cf . they concluded that regimens based on mcbt results did not result in a better clinical or bacteriological outcome . it is difficult to make comparisons between our findings and theirs for both clinical and technical reasons . on the clinical side , the patient populations ( post - lung - transplant cf versus non - lung - transplant cf ) and outcome measures were different . there are also major differences in the antimicrobial concentrations used in our modified mcbt test and the test as originally described [ 13 , 14 ] .   in our study , systemic breakpoint concentrations specified by the bsac to define susceptibility were used in a modified mcbt whereas antimicrobial concentrations in the original mcbt  were chosen on the basis of published estimates of the average peak levels seen in serum after standard single - dose intravenous administration  . as a result , the antimicrobial concentrations used in our modified mcbt were typically two- to eightfold lower than those previously described . as a consequence , fewer isolates would be likely to be classified as susceptible in our study . it is impossible to conclude whether the use of lower breakpoint concentrations of antimicrobials would have led to more favourable outcomes in the study of aaron et al . . as this is a retrospective study , we readily acknowledge that there are inherent limitations to our findings . the ten - year period covered by the study has seen numerous changes with regards to developments in lung transplantation . these include changes in immunosuppression regimen and the natural progression with regards to peritransplant management as the members of our centre gain more experience . given the nonrandomized nature of this study and temporal confounding factors , we can not definitely conclude that mcbt should be given at induction to all patients colonized with p. aeruginosa . however , the fact that we are dealing with a unique cohort of patients with significant microbiological challenges might render it unethical to conduct a full randomized control trial . furthermore , it is unlikely that sufficient numbers are recruited to adequately power such a study . the data presented is the first indication that patients given antibiotics based on mcbt results had significantly lower rates of septicaemia and lower rates of positive microbiological cultures in their pleural effusions . this is an encouraging finding , lending credence to the need for multi - centre prospective studies to be performed that will ideally lead to no patients being turned down for a lung transplant on the basis of colonisation with resistant microorganisms .","early infection is a recognised complication after lung transplantation in patients with cystic fibrosis ( cf ) . 
 our centre uses multiple combination bactericidal testing ( mcbt ) when determining appropriate peritransplant prophylactic regimens . to evaluate our strategy , we compared the incidence of posttransplant infection in patients whose peritransplant antimicrobial regimens were determined using mcbt versus standard sensitivity testing . 
 patients with cf who were infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa and underwent lung transplantations between 2000 and 2010 were included . 
 data was collected from clinical records and our microbiology database . 
 microorganisms cultured were mapped against antibiotic resistance , method of sensitivity testing , and antibiotics administered peritransplant . 
 129 patients were identified ( mean age 28 , male  :  female , 63  :  66 ) . 
 fifty patients ( 38.8% ) had antibiotics determined by mcbt . 
 two patients in the mcbt group developed septicaemia , 13 in the conventional group ( p  0.05 , 2-tailed fisher 's test ) . 
 sepsis was attributable to p. aeruginosa in one patient from the mcbt group and seven patients in the conventional group ( p = 0.15 ) . 
 p. aeruginosa was recovered from the posttransplant pleural fluid of one patient who received mcbt - guided prophylaxis , six patients in the conventional group ( p = 0.25 ) . 
 patients given antibiotics based on mcbt had significantly lower rates of septicaemia and lower rates of empyema .",334
"united states healthcare costs continue to escalate with no immediate relief in sight . in 2005 , healthcare spending totaled us$2.0 trillion16% of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) ( poisal et al 2007 ) . further , healthcare spending is projected to account for 18.4% of gdp by 2013 , when more than one out of every four dollars of personal consumption will be spent on healthcare ( heffler et al 2004 ) . the aging of americans is a central component fueling cost increases . in the year 2000 , 12.4% of americans were over age 65 , but this will increase to 19.6% in 2030 ( goulding et al 2003 ) . chronic diseases , especially prevalent in the senior population , generate a large proportion of medicare spending . in 19951999 ( the most recent data ) , only 5% of medicare beneficiaries , presumably many with chronic diseases , accounted for almost half ( 47% ) of total spending . a much larger segment of the population ( 40% ) , those in relatively good health , accounted for only 1% of the total ( liberman et al 2003 ) . preventing or postponing the onset of chronic disease among seniors has become a crucial public health issue , as has the potential to compress the period of morbidity prior to death ( vita et al 1998 ) . it has been estimated that approximately 70% of the total burden of disease ( as measured in terms of premature deaths and potential years of life lost ) can be traced back to illnesses that are preventable ( department of health and human services 1991 ) . particularly noteworthy is research by mcginnis and foege ( 1993 ) and mokdad and colleagues ( 2004 ) who concluded that about half of all deaths in the us are caused by modifiable risk factors . although death is inevitable , it is now becoming clear that successful health promotion programs can improve health , prevent much disability , delay mortality , and thereby substantially improve the quality of seniors lives ( aldana 2001 ; chernoff 2001 ) . the growing awareness of the value of prevention and health promotion is evident at the executive branch of government . the president launched the healthierus initiative , promoting healthier lifestyles and a reduction of risk factors such as inactivity , obesity , and smoking ( healthierus 2003 ) . the rationale for this initiative , especially in relation to health promotion efforts directed at seniors , is described on the white house website : 
  poor health should not be a foregone consequence of aging . improvements in diet and physical activity can greatly improve the quality of life at any age . regular physical activity also helps older americans maintain joint strength and mobility and substantially delays the onset of functional limitations and loss of independence . improvements in diet and physical activity can greatly improve the quality of life at any age . regular physical activity also helps older americans maintain joint strength and mobility and substantially delays the onset of functional limitations and loss of independence . the rapidly rising cost of healthcare , an aging population , and the high prevalence of chronic disease among the elderly generate a sense of urgency for finding innovative solutions to this country s healthcare crisis , including health promotion and disease prevention initiatives . in this paper , we highlight several key studies that underscore the value of introducing health promotion and risk reduction programs directed at seniors . furthermore , we present evidence suggesting that health promotion and risk reduction programs may reduce unnecessary healthcare utilization and related expenditures for the medicare program , yielding a favorable return - on - investment ( roi ) for such interventions . we finish our discussion with a description of an innovative demonstration project that centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) will be introducing in 2007 to test whether health promotion programs can improve the health of seniors and also achieve a positive cost - benefit ratio . a growing literature presents convincing evidence that seniors who reduce their modifiable health risks can forestall disability , reduce their utilization of health services , and ultimately save medicare money ( hickey et al 1997 ; king et al 1998 ; vita et al 1998 ; fries 2002 ; omenn 2003 ) . lubitz and colleagues ( 2003 ) presented evidence that elderly persons in better health at age 70 live about 2.7 years longer than those in poor health , and their cumulative medicare healthcare expenditures are no greater than those who die earlier ; in fact , they may be slightly lower . the macarthur study on aging , consisting of dozens of studies conducted over a decade , helped researchers identify components of successful aging ( seeman et al 2001 ) . for example , quitting smoking and initiating other lifestyle changes even later in life have produced substantial health benefits ( hickey et al 1997 ; hermanson et al 1988 ) . importantly , several studies confirm the value of physical activity for improving health among the elderly ( king 2001 ) . physical activity can extend life , help prevent heart disease and colon cancer , ( christmas and andersen 2001 ; penedo et al 2004 ) mitigate the effects of chronic diseases such as arthritis or diabetes ( christmas and andersen 2001 ; bean et al 2004 ) , improve coordination and flexibility to help avoid falls ( christmas and andersen 2001 ; bean et al 2004 ) , and alleviate depression among older adults ( christmas and andersen 2001 ) . adults who practice even simple physical activity can improve their health status and use fewer health and social services ( aldana 2001 ) . to emphasize the importance of physical activity , a comprehensive review by himes ( 2002 ) identified these two overriding determinants of health status for seniors : social isolation as a strongly negative influence and regular physical activity as a strongly positive factor . in the private sector , evidence suggests that multicomponent health promotion and risk reduction programs can permanently change lifestyle habits and reduce population health risks for nonseniors ( heaney and goetzel 1997 ) . a report by rand ( 2001 ) concluded that successful risk reduction programs directed at working and senior populations share certain characteristics that make them effective in changing life - long health habits . successful programs are anchored in behavior change theory , employ tailored and personalized interventions , are sufficiently intensive , and are complemented by adequate social supports . such programs appear to work effectively even if they are not delivered face - to - face , but instead provided by telephone , internet , and mail . in addition , health promotion programs that engage participants in self - care activities and increase their involvement in healthcare decision - making can achieve long - term behavior change and risk reductions ( heaney and goetzel 1997 ) . although much of this private sector research has been conducted with those under age 65 , the underlying principles and methods employed by these programs possess sufficient flexibility to be tailored to the unique needs of diverse populations , suggesting that risk reduction programs targeting seniors have a high potential to achieve lasting behavior changes and potentially lower utilization of healthcare services ( rand 2001 ) . other research in the private sector is pointing in the direction that evidence - based health promotion and risk reduction programs can save money . several literature reviews that weighed the evidence from experimental and quasi - experimental research studies suggest that programs grounded in behavior change theory and that utilize tailored communications and individualized counseling for high - risk individuals produce a positive roi ( goetzel et al 1999 ; aldana 2001 ; us department of health and human services 2003 ) . much of the roi research has emerged from employer - sponsored health promotion programs directed at active employees ( goetzel et al 1999 ; pelletier 2001 ) . in a review of 32 health promotion program evaluations , aldana ( 2001 ) found 28 studies that reported medical cost savings . of the seven studies that calculated cost - benefit ratios , financial returns averaged $ 3.48 for every dollar expended . studies often cited with the strongest research designs and large numbers of subjects included those performed at johnson and johnson ( bly et al 1986 ; breslow et al 1994 ) , citibank ( ozminkowski et al 1999 ) , dupont ( bertera 1990 ) , the bank of america ( leigh et al 1992 ; fries et al 1993 ) , tenneco ( baun et al 1986 ) , duke university ( knight et al 1994 ) , the california public employee retirees system ( calpers ) ( fries et al 1994 ) , procter and gamble ( goetzel , jacobsen , et al 1998 ) , and chevron corporation ( goetzel , dunn , et al 1998 ) . even accounting for certain inconsistencies in design and results , most produced positive cost outcomes . the most recent review on this topic conducted by chapman ( 2003 ) , summarizing the results from 42 qualifying financial impact studies conducted over the past two decades , concluded that worksite programs achieve a 25%30% reduction in medical and absenteeism costs in an average period of about 3.6 years ( goetzel , jacobsen , et al 1998 ) . similarly , the rand report ( 2001 ) concluded that health promotion and risk reduction programs using health risk assessments ( hras ) and ongoing tailored interventions have the potential to be cost - beneficial . five financial analyses are especially pertinent to cost - benefit calculations for medicare enrollees engaged in health promotion programs : four ( fries et al 1993 ; fries et al 1994 ; fries and mcshane 1998 ; ozminkowski et al 2006 ) focused on risk reduction programs for seniors ( at the bank of america , calpers , and at general motors corporation ) , and one for working - age individuals at citibank ( ozminkowski et al 1999 ) . employing available medical claims data to estimate changes in medical expenditures , that roi estimate was similar to one obtained in a randomized trial using the same intervention program in a different population ( fries et al 1993 ) . using methods that imputed changes in medical expenditures from changes in utilization , the evaluations of bank of america and calpers programs for seniors reported rois of approximately $ 5.00 to $ 1.00 . the general motors study was not an roi study , because it contained no program cost information . however , it did demonstrate that health promotion programs offered to seniors , particularly those that are based upon administering a health risk appraisal , can save $ 101 to $ 648 per person per year ( at the us dollar value for 2006 ) , depending upon who participates and how many programs they use . admittedly , the methodological rigor of evaluations performed at many corporate health promotion programs has not been consistent . in fact , randomized trials are hard to find in the literature , largely because they are not well accepted in a business environment . however , methodological shortcomings in earlier analyses have diminished significantly over the past two decades . the most recent evaluations using sophisticated econometric methods that control for selection bias do assess impact over several years ( with some extending for three to five years and one , performed at johnson & johnson , lasting nine years ) ( ozminkowski et al 2002 ) . these advances should inform future study designs of similar health promotion interventions directed at seniors . in short , a focus on prevention and health promotion offers a most promising approach to the urgent challenges that the medicare program faces today and into the future . research in the private sector presents compelling evidence to warrant large scale federally funded demonstrations that test the prospect for well - designed health promotion and risk reduction efforts to pay for themselves through lower healthcare expenditures . although some corporate studies have recently begun to focus on productivity impacts from these programs ( eg , reduced absenteeism , shortened disability periods , decreased  presenteeism  ) , much of the private sector research has emphasized healthcare cost savings . this is the same focus of policy makers and legislators with oversight responsibility for medicare . there are still several unanswered questions related to the application of health promotion and risk reduction programs in an elderly population . for example , will living a healthy life truly reduce seniors illnesses and incidence of disability prior to their demise or will they simply live longer and their illnesses and disability be delayed ? thus , will a longer life span cost medicare more because seniors are alive longer and may still experience significant end - of - life illness and costs ? these are testable hypotheses . while successful health promotion interventions could extend the period of healthy life and result in costs being incurred to the medicare program over a longer period of time , the alternatives are not appealing . researchers at rand recently estimated the costs of the future obese elderly , and found that medicare will spend 35% more caring for an obese 70-year - old person over his or her lifetime than for a normal weight person , at a cost of $ 36,000 ( lakdawalla et al 2005 ) . to explore these very complex issues , in 2007 , medicare will initiate a three and a half year research project entitled senior risk reduction demonstration ( srrd ) , to test the health and economic impacts of providing health promotion services , modeled after programs provided to those under age 65 . the srrd will provide insights on how to deliver such programs practically , an important step in advancing the medicare program from one focused on the diseases of older people to one focused on improving their health and quality of life . cms will offer risk reduction services to noninstitutionalized medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 67 and 74 , to be delivered by private sector vendors . five vendors will be given contact information for a random sample of beneficiaries from across the us , as well as from communities that have exemplary information and referral / assistance ( i&r / a ) programs for seniors.voluntary participation . incentives will be offered to induce high participation and retention rates , but participation will be at the discretion of the beneficiary.focus on self -

up phases of the intervention . risk factors addressed in the srrd include the following : 1 ) physical inactivity / lack of exercise ; 2 ) poor nutrition ; 3 ) smoking / tobacco use ; 4 ) excessive alcohol consumption ; 5 ) high blood pressure ; 6 ) high blood glucose ; 7 ) high total cholesterol ; 8) being overweight / obese ; 9 ) inappropriate use of clinical preventive services ; 10 ) depression ; 11 ) high stress ; 12 ) lack of general well - being ; 13 ) burden of providing care giving ; 14 ) social isolation ; 15 ) lack of motor vehicle / home safety ; 16 ) falls ( preventable accidents ) ; and 17 ) polypharmacy / medication issues . target population . cms will offer risk reduction services to noninstitutionalized medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 67 and 74 , to be delivered by private sector vendors . five vendors will be given contact information for a random sample of beneficiaries from across the us , as well as from communities that have exemplary information and referral / assistance ( i&r / a ) programs for seniors . incentives will be offered to induce high participation and retention rates , but participation will be at the discretion of the beneficiary . focus on self -

based approaches to risk reduction and health promotion that may not only help beneficiaries to take better care of themselves , but that are likely to generate a positive roi . the srrd will provide insights on how to deliver such programs practically , an important step in advancing the medicare program from one focused on the diseases of older people to one focused on improving their health and quality of life . in short , a focus on prevention and health promotion offers a most promising approach to the urgent challenges that the medicare program faces today and into the future .","the impact of an aging population on escalating us healthcare costs is influenced largely by the prevalence of chronic disease in this population . 
 consequently , preventing or postponing disease onset among the elderly has become a crucial public health issue . 
 fortunately , much of the total burden of disease is attributable to conditions that are preventable . in this paper 
 , we address whether well - designed health promotion programs can prevent illness , reduce disability , and improve the quality of life . 
 furthermore , we assess evidence that these programs have the potential to reduce healthcare utilization and related expenditures for the medicare program . 
 we hypothesize that seniors who reduce their modifiable health risks can forestall disability , reduce healthcare utilization , and save medicare money . 
 we end with a discussion of a new senior risk reduction demonstration , which will be initiated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services in 2007 , to test whether risk reduction programs developed in the private sector can achieve health improvements among seniors and a positive return on investment for the medicare program .",206
"the use of sodium hypochlorite as toilet detergent is related to a red - brown urine discolouration in patients taking mesalamine.it seems that the red - brown discolouration relates to a harmless reaction.polymerisation of mesalamine and/or metabolites could be a theoretical mechanism of this discolouration . the exact working mechanism of mesalamine is not fully understood , but it appears to have anti - inflammatory properties . the drug blocks interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor-. mesalamine also inhibits the cyclo - oxygenase pathway , leading to inhibition of prostaglandin e2 in inflamed intestine . the most common adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) , as described in the summary of product characteristics ( smpc ) , are headache , rash and gastrointestinal symptoms , including diarrhoea , nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain . mesalamine is also associated with the renal adrs of renal failure , interstitial nephritis and haematuria [ 1 , 3 ] . in the period from august 2009 to april 2015 , the netherlands pharmacovigilance centre lareb received two case reports of red - brown urine discolouration in association with mesalamine . both cases were reported by patients and the urine discoloured after contact with the toilet bowl . this case concerned a 38-year - old male with a history of crohn s disease . the patient reported separate several episodes of a red - brown deposit in the toilet bowl after the start of mesalamine in 1999 ( pentasa slow - release 500  mg tablet ) . the latest episode occurred in april 2015 , 2  days after the use of mesalamine . the patient had a mild form of crohn s disease that had been stable for 68  years and only used mesalamine during episodes of exacerbations . due to an exacerbation in september 2014 , the daily dose of mesalamine was increased from 2 to 4  g. during this dose escalation , the patient recognised the same red - brown deposit that had occurred during previous use . in january 2015 , the mesalamine was tapered over a period of 2  months to 2  g once daily and he remained stable . he observed that the urine initially had a normal colour and developed the red - brown colour after contact with the water in the toilet bowl . most of the time the persistent deposit did not appear directly after contact with the toilet water but developed after a few days , despite flushing the toilet . of note , the deposit in the toilet bowl was more intense during the use of an increased dose of 4  g a day . the patient wondered whether the use of detergents could have caused this kind of discolouration and therefore he cleaned his toilet in the morning with a chlorine - containing detergent . in the evening a red - brown deposit had developed in the toilet bowl and on the seat and the water was unaffected . as the patient wanted more information on the possibility of the discolouration being the result of a reaction with the sodium hypochlorite detergent , he reported it to lareb . after the report had been assessed , the pharmacovigilance centre lareb asked the patient to collect his urine and to add household bleach as a test , to which he agreed ( fig .  1 ) . the urine ( 40  ml ) was mixed with 20  ml of sodium hypochlorite bleach and within a few minutes the discolouration developed . after shaking the mixture , 1

 red  brown discolouration after adding sodium hypochlorite bleach to normal - appearing urine ( left , right ) . this case concerned a 36-year - old woman with ulcerative colitis , for which she is treated with 2  g of mesalamine ( pentasa sachet 2  g prolonged - release granules ) twice daily . since she started taking mesalamine in june 2009 , her urine appeared red - brown in the toilet bowl , but only when she had recently cleaned the toilet with sodium hypochlorite detergent . when the patient added a drop of sodium hypochlorite detergent to her normal - coloured urine in the toilet , the same red - brown discolouration occurred immediately . the patient is still taking mesalamine and the phenomenon is still present when cleaning the toilet . likewise , the disordered haem production in patients with porphyria can result in red - brown discolouration . a red - brown urine discolouration could be perceived as a sign of possible renal impairment or other diseases ; however , neither of the described patients are known to have an impaired renal function or physical abnormalities . furthermore , various drugs are associated with red and/or brown discolouration , e.g. rifampicin , doxorubicin , metronidazole , methyldopa , levodopa and sulfasalazine . a notable difference from the described mesalamine cases is that the urine of patients taking the above - mentioned drugs , such as sulfasalazine , is already discoloured at micturition . a pubmed search was conducted and it was found that two cases of red - brown urine associated with mesalamine have been reported previously by sacks and davis . both of the male adolescents in these reports experienced the same red - brown urine discolouration after contact with sodium hypochlorite bleach . a similar experiment was performed to that performed by patient  a , and after adding sodium hypochlorite bleach to the collected urine the discolouration developed spontaneously . to our knowledge , there are no other published reports of this association after a chemical reaction with drugs structurally related to mesalamine ( sulfasalazine , olsalazine and 4-aminosalicylic acid ) . notably , there has been discussion regarding this phenomenon in several patient forums and blogs . case reports from altmann and mansell   do , however , describe urine discolouration in patients using methyldopa or levodopa after contact with lavatory bleach and exposure to light . normal biotransformation of methyldopa produces a variety of metabolites ; presumably , these metabolites have properties that form melanin by spontaneous polymerisation , which results in darkening of the urine . melanins are polymers of phenolic compounds ( e.g. dopaquinone , benzothiazole ) that are formed by an extensive bio pathway . melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules such as pheomelanin and eumelanin ; both of these are initially formed by oxidation of tyrosine and then undergo cysteinylation and cyclisation , respectively . the end product is ultimately formed by polymerisation of several different derivatives . altmann and mansell   found that urine samples that were made alkaline in patients treated with methyldopa or levodopa turned black on exposure to sunlight . mesalamine is acetylated by the enzyme n - acetyltransferase  1 ( nat1 ) in the liver and gut mucosal wall into the metabolite n - acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid ( n - ac-5asa ) . evidence from the literature indicates that nat1 is polymorphic , but that these polymorphisms are associated with relatively minor effects on acetylation function . it is unknown whether the patients in our reports have a nat1 polymorphism , but if so we would expect no significant effect on the propensity of discolouring . furthermore , this acetylation is minimal when mesalamine and n - ac-5asa are both secreted back into the lumen by the drug efflux pump p - glycoprotein , excreted in the faeces , absorbed via the colon into the blood and , lastly , eliminated in the urine . the theory is that n - ac-5asa and/or mesalamine react with the sodium hypochlorite - containing bleach . sodium hypochlorite usually has a ph of 1113 and could therefore initiate the reaction as described by altmann and mansell . according to the cases reported by altmann and mansell , it is also possible that a similar polymerisation of mesalamine and/or n - ac-5asa could cause the discolouration of the urine . perhaps due to the alkaline environment , partial deprotonation of n - ac-5asa and mesalamine could also contribute to this reaction . since the introduction of the national spontaneous reporting system in 2003 to the general public , consumers have now become the largest group of reporters in the netherlands . the quality of consumer reports are generally good and these reports highlight via first - hand information the real - life experience of an adr . being unconstrained with regards to the probability of causality , consumers may report relevant adrs that healthcare professionals may not recognise initially or consider to be unlikely . patient  b s gastroenterologist recognised the phenomenon , but it is conceivable that not every gastroenterologist will establish a direct relationship between urine discolouration , mesalamine therapy and the use of a specific detergent . the two reports received provide important information about a harmless reaction as this phenomenon probably concerns a lot of other patients using mesalamine . based on the described reports and the case reports in the literature , we suggest a causal relationship between red  brown discolouration of urine after contact with sodium hypochlorite detergent and the use of mesalamine . the naranjo assessment scores for cases a and b were 9 and 6 , indicating a certain and probable relationship , respectively . this seems to be a harmless reaction as the patients experienced no physical complaints and in both the lareb cases and those described by sacks and davis , the patients were under the care of a gastroenterologist . in the differential diagnosis it is important to be aware that the use of sodium hypochlorite as a toilet detergent could be the cause of coloured deposits in and on the toilet bowl . the presence of sodium hypochlorite does not exclude the possibility of renal impairment ; therefore , it is important to distinguish already discoloured urine from normal - coloured urine that only discoloured after contacting the toilet bowl . thus , to inform and reassure patients , it might be helpful to mention red - brown discolouration in the patient leaflet for mesalamine . no financial support was received for the conduct of this study or preparation of this manuscript .","a 38-year - old male and a 36-year - old female experienced red - brown urine discolouration after 2 and 3  days , respectively , during the use of mesalamine for inflammatory bowel disease . 
 both patients mentioned that the urine discoloured after contact with sodium hypochlorite detergent in toilet water . 
 mesalamine and the inactive metabolite n - acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid are primarily excreted in the urine . 
 we hypothesised a possible reaction with sodium hypochlorite and/or light . 
 naranjo assessment scores of 9 and 6 were obtained for the reports , indicating a certain and probable relationship , respectively , between the red - brown urine discolouration and the use of the suspect drug mesalamine . 
 knowledge of this harmless reaction is desirable to avoid unnecessary physical examination and worry .",180
"the number of patients undergoing chemotherapy grows year by year . despite their efficacy in controlling the cancer , chemotherapy drugs are not inert , and they cause damage to the human body regarding nail involvement , diverse clinical features can be observed , according to the structure affected and the severity of the damage caused . the most common chemotherapeutic agents implicated in nail changes are cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin and hydroxyurea [ 2 , 3 ] . in the majority of cases , the effects are fully reversible after a few months once the causative agent has been withdrawn [ 2 , 4 ] . a 25-year - old male patient was admitted to the hospital 's hematology ward with the diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia . the hyper - cvad regimen delivers a combination of drugs in 2 cycles ( cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin and dexamethasone in cycle a , methotrexate and cytarabine in cycle b ) , split into smaller doses and administered at more frequent intervals in order to minimize side effects . during hospitalization , a dermatology assessment was requested . the dermatological examination showed nail injury characterized by transverse , brown - gray hyperpigmentation affecting the proximal half of the nail plate , with a brown band delimiting the healthy nail plate on all fingers ( fig . 1 , fig chromonychia induced by chemotherapeutic agents has different forms , the most common being melanonychia [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . the dark pigmentation in nails can be diffuse , transverse or longitudinal and can coexist with skin and mucosal pigmentation [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] . it has been suggested that chemotherapy drug regimens influence the incidence of changes that may result from toxicity in the nail matrix , nail bed , periungual tissue and digits vessels [ 2 , 6 ] . although several chemotherapeutic agents can cause these changes , those most associated with these side effects are cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin and hydroxyurea [ 2 , 3 ] . cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent whose main target is the cell cycle ; thus , tissues with high proliferation rates are more susceptible . alkylating agents form cross - links with dna filaments and prevent dna replication , therefore entailing cytotoxicity . cyclophosphamide can cause nail changes such as diffuse , black pigmentation , longitudinal striae ranging in color from slate gray to black , and diffuse , dark gray pigmentation located proximally , with overlying transverse , black bands [ 2 , 4 ] . this drug - induced nail pigmentation starts from the proximal edge of the nail and proceeds towards the distal edge . upon withdrawal of the drug it takes approximately 46 months [ 2 , 3 ] . in 60% of patients , cyclophosphamide is also associated with pigmentation of the oral mucosa and tongue , which also regresses upon withdrawal of the drug [ 2 , 4 ] . its side effects include skin and nail hyperpigmentation , alopecia , skin rash , pruritus , photosensitivity , urticaria , acral erythema and palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia . nail changes such as transverse , dark brown bands alternating with white stripes [ 2 , 7 ] and dark brown diffuse pigmentation bands 45 mm wide , which affect two - thirds of the distal portion of the nail , also occur [ 2 , 5 ] . additionally , doxorubicin can cause subungual keratosis , onycholysis and thickening of the nail plate . hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of dna synthesis by acting as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase , without interfering in the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or protein . this pigmentation has a diffuse , dark brown color which may appear as single or double transverse bands [ 2 , 4 ] . ungual hyperpigmentation induced by chemotherapy is not uncommon , although its occurrence is underestimated and seldom reported , especially in patients with dark skin phototypes , such as our patient , in this case , the drugs most probably implicated are doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide because they produce ungual alterations very similar to the ones seen in our patient ; his chemotherapeutic scheme included both of them .","chemotherapy drugs can affect the skin and its appendages . 
 several clinical presentations can be observed , depending on the affected structure . 
 the most common dermatological side effect is chromonychia . 
 the main causative agents are : ( 1 ) cyclophosphamide , which can provoke a diffuse , black pigmentation , longitudinal striae and dark grey pigmentation located proximally on the nails ; ( 2 ) doxorubicin , which promotes dark brown bands alternating with white striae and dark brown pigmentation in transverse bands , and ( 3 ) hydroxyurea , which produces a distal , diffuse , dark brown pigmentation . in the majority of cases , 
 the effects are reversible after the suspension of the causative agent for a few months . 
 we report a patient who developed chromonychia while undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , dexamethasone , methotrexate and cytarabine for acute lymphocytic leukemia .",200
"cavernous haemangioma is the most common primary orbital tumour in adults , accounting for 6% of all orbital lesions [ 13 ] . orbital schwannomas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours and constitute 1% of all orbital tumours [ 1 , 3 ] . orbital cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas present as slow progressive enlargement and the most common presenting sign and symptom is painless proptosis [ 48 ] . although both orbital cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas share many similar clinical and radiological characteristics [ 58 ] , it is important to distinguish between the tumours because they demonstrate important different features and the treatments of choice for the two are different [ 3 , 79 ] . magnetic resonance imaging , especially dynamic mr imaging , plays a crucial role in the differentiation of orbital cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas [ 7 , 8 , 1014 ] . the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement on dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging is considered the most important finding distinguishing the two tumours [ 1014 ] . however , the literature on mr imaging findings in the differentiation of these two tumours is based on small patient populations . consequently , this study aims to assess mr imaging findings distinguishing orbital cavernous haemangiomas from schwannomas and to elaborate on specific differences between the two tumours . between june 2004 and february 2009 , 43 patients with cavernous haemangiomas and 16 patients with schwannomas confirmed by pathological results were enrolled in the protocol . mr imaging including t1- and t2-weighted imaging and contrast - enhanced mr imaging was performed in all 59 patients . most patients presented with painless insidious proptosis . some patients demonstrated a limitation of extraocular motion , diplopia and strabismus . informed consent was obtained from all patients for anonymous performance of radiological studies and analysis of clinical data . magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a general electric ( ge ) signa 1.5-t mr imaging system ( ge healthcare , milwaukee , wi , usa ) with an eight - channel head coil . mr imaging was performed with t1-weighted ( repetition time / echo time , 400/15  ms ) and t2-weighted ( 3,000/120 ) fast spin - echo images . a 16-cm field of view , a 3-mm - thick section at 0 interval , and a 288    256 matrix with two signals acquired were used . dynamic contrast - enhanced ( dce ) mr imaging was performed by using a fast spoiled gradient recalled ( fspgr ) sequence with 8.4/4  ms , a flip angle of 15 , one excitation , a matrix of 256    160 , a field of view of 220    220  mm , and a section thickness of 3.2  mm at 0 interval . a power injector ( medrad , indianola , pa , usa ) with an injection flow rate of 2  ml / the acquisition of the dynamic images began concurrently with the initiation of the injection of 0.1  mmol of gadopentetate dimeglumine ( magnevist , schering , berlin , germany ) per kilogram . each mr sequence yielded 12 anatomical slices in 13  s ; this was repeated 12 times with an interval between each sequence of 12  s. total imaging time was 288  s ( 4  min 48  s ) . dce mr imaging was evaluated by using a ge aw 4.2 workstation ( ge healthcare ) . a region of interest ( roi ) was drawn manually on the dynamic images for assessment of the enhancement kinetics . we chose the area that demonstrated the greatest degree of early enhancement so that the time  intensity curve ( tic ) could be generated . the area of the roi typically was 8  mm . the contrast index ( ci ) was calculated from : ci  =  [ ( signal intensity post - contrast )    ( signal intensity pre - contrast)]/(signal intensity pre - contrast ) . the tics were analysed qualitatively as wash - out , persistent or plateau - shaped curves . magnetic resonance imaging features including dce mr imaging were retrospectively evaluated by an experienced head and neck radiologist ( 15  years experience ) . location , configuration , margins , signal intensity , homogeneity and enhancement pattern of the tumour were assessed . the location was defined as anterior orbit ( anterior orbit is defined as the orbit anterior to the posterior ethmoidal artery ) , posterior orbit ( posterior orbit is defined as the orbit posterior to the posterior ethmoidal artery ) , or both anterior and posterior orbit ; extraconal or intraconal space ; superior or inferior orbit ; and nasal or temporal orbit . on contrast - enhanced mr imaging including dce mr imaging , the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement , enhancement pattern , ci and type of tic were evaluated . the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement was divided into two groups : one starting from a small point or portion and the other starting from a wide area . progressive  enhancement means that on early imaging after the injection , one small point or portion of enhancement was initially noted , then contrast media progressively filled up the tumour and eventually the mass showed total and homogeneous enhancement ( fig .  1 ) . other patterns of enhancement included gradually heterogeneous enhancement and gradually homogeneous enhancement .

enhanced mr imaging features orbital cavernous haemangiomas were always a well - defined , ovoid , intraconal mass with markedly homogeneous hyperintensity signal on t2-weighted imaging . schwannomas often demonstrated a heterogeneously isointense or mildly hyperintense mass in the intraconal or extraconal space . after gadolinium administration , all 43 cavernous haemangiomas showed enhancement starting from a small point or portion and contrast media filling up the tumour later , i.e.  progressive  enhancement ( fig .  1 ) . compared with the cavernous haemangiomas , all 16 schwannomas showed enhancement starting from a wide area and heterogeneous or homogeneous enhancement later ( fig .  2 ) . orbital cavernous haemangiomas , the most common primary orbital tumour in adults , demonstrate a predilection to affect middle - aged women ( 6070% ) , with a mean age of 43 to 48  years and range of 18 to 72  years based on several large series [ 4 , 7 , 9 ] . the most common presenting sign and symptom of the orbital cavernous haemangioma is painless proptosis . in the past , orbital cavernous haemangiomas were invariably resected because they could not be conclusively discerned from other tumours clinically or radiologically . however , orbital cavernous haemangiomas have recently been classified as type 3 low - flow arteriovenous malformations with a direct arterial in - flow and venous out - flow mechanism ( arterial low - flow type ) rather than as true neoplasms or proliferating hamartomas , and , to our knowledge , there is no evidence of malignant transformation in the literature . moreover , ct and mr imaging , especially mr imaging , have evolved to deliver high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing orbital cavernous haemangiomas and distinguishing cavernous haemangiomas from other tumours , which have played a vital role in accurate diagnosis and correct treatment planning [ 5 , 7 , 12 , 14 , 16 ] . therefore , recent literature supports observation as an alternative to surgical excision for asymptomatic orbital cavernous haemangiomas and surgery can be withheld until vision is threatened or cosmetic appearance resulting from proptosis is unacceptable [ 3 , 9 ] . orbital schwannomas , constituting 1% of all orbital tumours , are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours originating purely from schwann cells and usually seen in young to middle - aged adults and rarely in children . clinical findings of orbital schwannomas are generally similar to those of cavernous haemangiomas , but they are somewhat more likely to exhibit progressive growth and symptoms . thus , surgical excision is the treatment of choice for orbital schwannomas , different from orbital cavernous haemangiomas [ 3 , 79 ] . our results demonstrate that , in presence of a well - defined , ovoid , intraconal mass with markedly homogeneous hyperintensity signal on t2-weighted imaging , one small point or portion of enhancement initially noted after administration of contrast medium and  progressive  enhancement on later enhancement images , favours the diagnosis of cavernous haemangioma instead of schwannoma . most orbital cavernous haemangiomas are identified in the intraconal space , predominantly in the lateral aspect of the intraconal space [ 7 , 9 ] . in our series , only 8 of the 43 orbital cavernous haemangiomas were in the extraconal space . however , orbital schwannomas more commonly arise from sensory nerves in the orbit , specifically the supraorbital , supratrochlear and lacrimal nerves , and thus are usually outside the orbital muscle cone . the nasociliary nerve is the only division of the ophthalmic nerve within the annular tendon . therefore , orbital schwannomas can be seen as an intraconal or extraconal mass . in our series , the frequency of the schwannoma being located in the extraconal or intraconal space is almost the same . orbital cavernous haemangiomas appear isointense to muscle on t1-weighted imaging and hyperintense to muscle on t2-weighted imaging [ 5 , 7 ] . although non - contrast mr imaging findings are non - specific , they may offer some advantage in the differentiation of orbital cavernous haemangiomas by demonstrating marked hyperintensity signal to muscle with internal septations on t2-weighted imaging , a hypointense circumferential rim corresponding to the fibrous pseudocapsule , and chemical shift artefact in the frequency - encoded direction secondary to high water content within the lesion surrounded by orbital fat [ 5 , 7 , 17 ] . orbital schwannoma is isointense with respect to the extraocular muscle on t1-weighted images and mildly hyperintense on t2-weighted images [ 6 , 18 ] . orbital schwannomas may undergo cavitary change , which appears as a cystic mass with straw - coloured fluid on gross pathological examination and looks homogeneously hypointense to muscle on t1-weighted images and hyperintense on t2-weighted images [ 8 , 19 ] . consequently , markedly homogeneous hyperintensity signal on t2-weighted imaging is one of the reliable findings distinguishing the two tumours . variable degrees of contrast enhancement observed in orbital cavernous haemangiomas were reported , probably related to variable imaging times after contrast medium infusion . however , multiphase dynamic contrast ct and mri demonstrated virtually pathognomonic imaging features of orbital cavernous haemangiomas [ 5 , 7 , 17 ] . on early imaging after the injection , one small point or portion of enhancement is initially noted because of its low - flow arterial supply , and the slow progressive accumulation of contrast medium continues within the dilated vascular spaces filling in centrally during the late venous phase . subsequently , homogeneous contrast enhancement occurs and persists in the delayed equilibrium phases [ 7 , 1216 ] . this enhancement pattern is referred to as a  progressive  enhancement pattern in the literature [ 10 , 11 , 13 ] . several multiphase dynamic contrast mr imaging protocols have been reported for studying orbital cavernous haemangiomas [ 7 , 11 , 12 , 14 ] . compared with orbital cavernous haemangiomas , no  progressive  enhancement pattern was found in orbital schwannomas [ 12 , 18 ] . therefore , our results and the literature showed that the  progressive  enhancement pattern will be the most reliable finding in distinguishing orbital cavernous haemangiomas from schwannomas . some reports in the literature indicated that orbital cavernous haemangiomas showed an initial central point or portion enhancement after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine [ 7 , 1214 ] . however , our results show that enhancement starts from one peripheral point or portion of the tumour in most orbital cavernous haemangiomas . the initial enhancement point represents the connecting point of feeding vessels to the lesion , which is useful for estimating the connecting point of the feeding vessels . an unexpected result is that nearly half of orbital cavernous haemangiomas demonstrate a wash - out tic type frequently seen in the malignant tumour rather than a plateau - shaped or persistent tic type . this may be because contrast medium fills one portion of the tumour during an early phase after administration of contrast medium and contrast medium diffuses into adjacent spaces through the foramen of the fibrous interstitium between spaces at a later phase [ 1214 ] . thus it results in a decrease in concentration of contrast media in the portion of the tumour filled by contrast media during the early phase . there is a significant difference in tic type between orbital cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas in contrast to a previous report that there is no significant difference in tic type between the two tumours . this is probably because we chose an roi covering the greatest degree of early enhancement rather than the whole tumour . recent literature on dynamic mr imaging in the breast , soft tissue and orbital masses indicates that an roi covering the greatest degree of early enhancement of the mass reflects haemodynamic alterations of the tumour better than an roi covering the whole tumour [ 10 , 21 , 22 ] . the multiphase dynamic contrast mr imaging findings of orbital cavernous haemangiomas have been described in the literature [ 1014 ] . however , our results provided additional information on dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging findings of orbital cavernous haemangiomas . first , short imaging time and interval of every phase on dynamic contrast mr imaging may accurately show one point or small portion of enhancement of the mass on early phase images after the injection of contrast medium and allow characterization of specific spread pattern of the contrast enhancement in small orbital cavernous haemangiomas , which can differentiate small orbital cavernous haemangiomas from small schwannomas and other tumours . second , tic type of orbital cavernous haemangioma is significantly different from that of schwannoma . previous literature showed small haemangiomas could not be differentiated from haemangiopericytomas as their enhancement appears early and strongly and calcification could be noticed in cavernous haemangiomas , contributing to the differential diagnosis [ 5 , 7 ] . however , calcification is occasionally seen in cavernous haemangiomas and plays a limited role in the differential diagnosis . our results revealed that strong enhancement starting from a wide area and rapid wash - out on dce mr imaging were seen in haemangiopericytomas that might be helpful in the differential diagnosis . capillary haemangiomas are a different sort of haemangiomatous tumour that are more common in children , often regress and have a different imaging appearance [ 5 , 7 ] . cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas have different mr imaging features including the location , configuration and margins of the mass , signal intensity and homogeneity on t1- and t2-weighted imaging , the spread pattern of contrast enhancement , the enhancement pattern and tic type , which could be helpful in the differentiation of the two tumours . the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement on dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging is the most reliable finding distinguishing cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas . markedly homogeneous hyperintensity signal on t2-weighted imaging is another reliable finding distinguishing the two tumours . mr imaging , especially dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging , plays a vital role in the differential diagnosis of cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas .","objectiveit is important to distinguish between orbital cavernous haemangioma and schwannoma because the treatments of choice for the two tumours are different . 
 the aim was to evaluate mr imaging findings distinguishing the two tumours.methodsmagnetic resonance imaging including t1- and t2-weighted imaging and contrast - enhanced mr imaging was performed in 43 patients with cavernous haemangiomas and 16 patients with schwannomas confirmed by pathology . 
 location , configuration , margins , signal intensity , homogeneity and enhancement pattern of the tumour were retrospectively evaluated.resultsthere was a significant difference between cavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas regarding the location , configuration and margins of the mass , signal intensity and homogeneity on t1- and t2-weighted imaging , the spread pattern of contrast enhancement , the enhancement pattern and the type of time 
 intensity curve ( p  <  0.05 ) . 
 markedly homogeneous hyperintensity signal on t2-weighted imaging and the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement favoured cavernous haemangioma rather than schwannoma ( p  <  0.01).conclusioncavernous haemangiomas and schwannomas have different mr imaging features that could be helpful in the differentiation between the tumours . 
 the spread pattern of the contrast enhancement on dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging is the most reliable finding distinguishing cavernous haemangiomas from schwannomas .",288
"madelung 's disease is characterised by multiple disfiguring abnormal fat masses in the head , the neck , and the radix of upper limbs ; in 90% of cases it 's associated with alcohol abuse . the local injections of phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate solution have been gaining an increasing consensus as a non - invasive method to shrink localized adiposities . the authors report their long term experience on the assessment of serial intralipotherapy with phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate in two patients affected by madelung 's disease . two male patients suffering from madelung 's disease underwent serial intralipotherapy with phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate ( lipostabil -nattermann pharma , cologne , germany ) . pre- and 6 months post - treatment dimensions were assessed by measuring three diameters in each lesion with a 7.5 mhz probe ultrasound ( us ) scan performed by the same operator . a 45-year - old man , smoker , without history of alcohol abuse , affected by multiple comorbidities , presented with symmetric huge lipomatosis of the head , neck , dorsum , posterior aspect of the arms and testicles . chest x - rays and head and neck magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) confirmed the infiltrative distribution of the lipomatosis and excluded the involvement of the trachea and other deep structures . even if a previous surgical excision of some cervico - occipital adipose deposits had been successful , the patient , who was still physically and psychologically impaired , refused a further surgical treatment under general anaesthesia of the remaining untreated adipose deposits : these infiltrating masses were therefore addressed with serial intralesional lipostabil injections . under us scan control 5 ml of lipostabil were injected into the jugular , submandibular and right cheek masses , respectively . the injections were repeated monthly for an overall of three treatments per lesion [ figures 1 and 2 ] . case 1 , right cheek mass : ( a ) pre - treatment view ; ( b ) post - treatment view case 1 , submandibular and jugular masses : ( a ) pre - treatment view ; ( b ) post - treatment view a 49-year - old - man , with a history of alcohol abuse and multiple comorbidities presented with enormous bilateral axillary fat deposits and some unpleasant adipose deposits in the dorsum and the submental and supraclavear areas . the axillary masses were surgically addressed , with no evidence of recurrence at 4 years follow - up . three other smaller submental and bilateral supraclavear deposits were injected with 5 ml of lipostabil each under us scan control . the injections were repeated monthly for an overall of three treatments per lesion [ figures 3 and 4 ] . case 2 , bilateral supraclavear masses : ( a ) pre -

up all of the lesions appeared stable . dimension changes in the treated lesions as demonstrated by us scan 6 months after the treatment are reported in table 1 and figure 5 . no local and/or systemic side - effects were reported . in both patients , one treated lesion out of three showed a slow clinical progression and required surgical excision . all of the other treated lesions are clinically stable at 5 years follow - up . measures in centimetres of the three main diameters at us scan before and after 3 injections of lipostabil ultrasound scan images - case 1 , right cheek mass : ( a ) pretreatment ; ( b ) post - treatment madelung 's disease is a lipomatosis classified in type 1 , with adipose masses symmetrically distributed in the body and in type 2 , with a diffuse obese - like fat distribution . diagnosis is clinically based and mri , computed tomography , and us scan allow evaluation of the fat deposits distribution . our two cases belong to type 1 with evident deposits in the head and neck . both patients had their major masses surgically removed ; the smaller , but more visible ones were deliberately addressed non - surgically with lipostabil , in order to avoid or at least postpone further surgery . treatment of hyperlipidemias and fat emboli , but diffusely employed subcutaneously in an off - label regimen to reduce localised adiposity and the volume of lipomas . the off - label use of lipostabil for the treatment of localised adiposity is actually controversial in the literature . in 2010 , the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) cautioned medical spas against misleading consumers by false statements about drugs including phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate that would eliminate fat in a procedure called  lipodissolve . the fda keeps encouraging health care professionals and consumers to report any side - effects with the use of these drugs to the fda 's medwatch adverse event reporting program . it is approved for cardiological use to reduce cholesterol in some countries in europe , though not including the united kingdom . until date , lipostabil is not available in the italian market as the product trade registration was no longer provided by the manufacturer since may the 20 2004 . nevertheless , in italy , by the law 94/1998 the clinical use of phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate is currently allowed as a galenical under the following strict circumstances : the treatment should be tailored on one individual patient , the physician should provide the patient a fully informed consent and the prescription should provide both the patient 's identity data and a reference number to the physician 's medical archive . its lipolytic action seems to be based on stimulation of lipase activity , emulsification and transport of triglycerides and a detergent action by its two main components , both causing cell membrane lysis , inflammation , fibrosis and degeneration of fat tissue . in one case acute renal failure and liver dysfunction have been reported as severe systemic side - effects following a single high dose subcutaneous injection . recently , it has been suggested that phosphatidylcholine might eventually have some therapeutic role in some cancers as animal studies indicate that deficiencies in choline and phosphatidylcholine may disrupt cell membrane signal transduction in ways that could lead to various cancers . furthermore , there is ample evidence that liver cancer is promoted in various animals by choline - deficient diets , and it has been shown that excess choline has a protective effect against carcinogenesis . known safety limits of phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate compound are 15 mg / kg . a successful experience of serial intralipotherapy with a blend of lidocaine , aminophillin , l - carnitine , phosphatidylcholine and deoxycholate solution for the treatment of one patient affected by madelung 's disease is reported . according to the literature common off - label use of phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate compound for localised fat deposits ranges between 1000 and 250 mg / session . our choice of lipostabil dosage , therefore , considered both the fat masses size and those safety limits . our results objectively demonstrated an average reduction of 42.5% in the three us scan measured diameters in all of the treated lesions 6 months after the treatment [ table 2 and figure 5 ] . percentage reduction of the masses at us scan in the three main diameters the 5 years clinical follow - up demonstrated the long - term functional and cosmetic stable results in 66% of the treated lesions . the treatment also proved to be safe as serum lipid status was not modified at 1 month since the last infiltration session . in madelung 's disease , the surgical approach is always invasive and often risky both for the anatomical complexity of the involved areas ( cervico - facial regions ) and for these patients general conditions , which are poor most of the time . the objectively demonstrated efficacy and safety of the treatment at the employed dosage together with its easy execution confirm the role of lipostabil as a non - invasive palliative reasonable therapeutic opportunity in madelung 's disease and an alternative to surgery in the more awkward locations of the disease . the phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate compound needs wide investigation for new treatment uses and long - term studies and hence that the recommended dose and safe application technique can be standardised . the use of  lipodissolve  products should be considered an experimental treatment and be performed under strict medical control for both therapeutical and cosmetic purposes . our experience might , therefore , further contribute to the investigation of limits and possibilities of the clinical use of phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate in the treatment of localised adiposities of any nature . according to our experience the inclusion of phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate intralesional intralipotherapy in the armamentarium for the palliative treatment of madelung 's disease might be recommended to reduce the volume and limit the growth of the pathological adipose masses and to restrict the aggressive and often unacceptable anatomical consequences of the disease .","madelung 's disease is characterised by multiple symmetric abnormal fat masses in the head , neck and upper limbs . surgical excision or liposuction is the only realistic available option , although palliative in nature . 
 the serial intralipotherapy with phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate has been proposed as a non - invasive treatment of madelung 's disease . 
 the authors used serial intralipotherapy with phosphatidylcholine / deoxycholate in two patients affected by madelung 's disease . 
 three injections per lesion per patient were performed with 1 month 's interval . 
 pre- and 6 months post - treatment dimensions were assessed with ultrasound scan and patients were observed along a 5 years clinical follow - up . 
 a 42.5% average size reduction was reported in all treated lesions . 
 about 33% recurrence rate was observed in the 5 years follow - up . 
 we confirm the efficacy of intralipotherapy in the non - invasive palliative treatment of madelung 's disease , as a valid option to reduce the volume and limit the growth of the pathological adipose masses .",235
"lansoprazole is a racemic mixture composed of equal proportions ( 50:50 ) of ( r)-lansoprazole ( also known as dexlansoprazole ) and ( s)-lansoprazole . these two enantiomers have been quantified separately in blood after ingestion of lansoprazole 30 mg in healthy volunteers and it was found that the mean maximum plasma concentration ( cmax ) and area under the plasma drug concentration - time curve ( auc ) values were 3- to 5-fold greater for dexlansoprazole than ( s)-lansoprazole.16 this suggests that the hepatic clearance of lansoprazole is stereoselective in favor of the ( s ) enantiomer leading to higher systemic exposure of and in vivo residence for dexlansoprazole as compared to its antipode , ( s)-lansoprazole . dexlansoprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins ( 96.1%98.8% bound ) and has an apparent volume of distribution of 40.3 l in subjects with gerd.17 the elimination of dexlansoprazole is via the hepatic route ; biotransformation to oxidative metabolites occurs via cyp2c19 and cyp3a4 with subsequent conjugation to inactive products and elimination in the urine and feces . in vitro data suggest that cyp2c19 displays more specificity for r- than s - lansoprazole , and that cyp3a4 is more specific for s - lansoprazole.18 dexlansoprazole does not appear to be eliminated unchanged in the urine . the elimination half - life of dexlansoprazole is approximately 12 hours in healthy subjects and in patients with symptomatic gerd ; this is similar to other ppi . the dual delayed release formulation ( ddr ) employed in delivering dexlansoprazole is a more significant factor in prolonging drug residence time in the body after oral administration than the inherently slower clearance of dexlansoprazole as compared to the ( s)-enantiomer . the ddr formulation delivers 2 drug inputs in the proximal and more distal small intestine . distinct ph - dependent releases of drug are designed to occur from two types of enteric - coated granules housed in a gelatin capsule . upon dissolution of the outer capsule in the stomach , the first type of granule is designed to release quickly after the granules reach the proximal duodenum providing an initial drug release profile similar to that of lansoprazole and resulting in an initial peak in plasma dexlansoprazole concentrations within 1 to 2 hours of capsule ingestion . the second release from the remaining granules is designed to release farther along the gastrointestinal tract at the distal portion of the small intestine and creates a second drug peak in plasma dexlansoprazole concentrations within 4 to 5 hours of capsule ingestion . the purpose of the second release is to provide a greater amount of drug to be absorbed later in the dosing interval in order to provide extended duration of acid suppression . therefore , the resulting time - concentration profile of dexlansoprazole mr reveals a two - peaked pattern that extends to approximately 12 hours after a dose is ingested ( figure 1 ) . the relationship between exposure of dexlansoprazole following administration of dexlansoprazole mr and its pharmacodynamic effect measured as intragastric ph has been described using an emax model.19 a total of 83 healthy subjects met the entry criteria for 2 studies , and were included in this combined analysis . subjects were administered 30 , 60 , 90 , and 120 mg of dexlansoprazole mr in randomized crossover fashion in these two separate studies . the systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole measured as cmax and auc values was dose - proportional and time - independent . these two pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies confirmed that the ddr technology used in the dexlansoprazole mr formulation prolonged drug exposure ; pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling suggested that doses lower than 30 mg may result in therapeutically suboptimal intragastric ph control . furthermore , it was demonstrated that doses higher than 90 mg would be unlikely to provide additional clinically meaningful pharmacologic response . in a retrospective analysis using data from 2 separate but similarly designed studies the pharmacokinetic profiles of dexlansoprazole mr 60 mg and lansoprazole 60 mg were compared after 5 days of dosing in healthy volunteers , demonstrating that the tmax for both regimens occurred 1 to 2 hours after administration , and that the second peak for dexlansoprazole mr occurred 4 to 5 hours after administration.20 the results from this single post - hoc analysis also showed that the mean residence time for dexlansoprazole mr was nearly double that of lansoprazole at equivalent doses of 60 mg once daily ( 5.5 hours vs 2.9 hours , respectively).21 the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and safety of three dosing regimens of dexlansoprazole mr ( 60 , 90 , and 120 mg ) and lansoprazole 30 mg were assessed in an open - label , multiple - dose , single - center , four - period , crossover study in 40 subjects.22 after 5 days of once daily administration dexlansoprazole mr 60 mg produced statistically significantly greater mean 24-hour intragastric ph compared to lansoprazole 30 mg ( 4.55 vs 4.13 , respectively , p < 0.001 ) ; a statistically significant increase in % time 24-hour intragastric ph > 4 was also observed ( 71% vs 60% , respectively , p < 0.01 ) ( figure 2 ) . the 90 mg dose of dexlansoprazole mr produced 24-hour intragastric ph > 4 for 70% of the time . the pharmacodynamic effect of dexlansoprazole mr 120 mg was similar to that of the 90 mg dose . the clinical significance of these differences remains unknown , but the ddr formulation of dexlansoprazole mr appears to provide pharmacodynamic benefit beyond that of lansoprazole most likely due to the extended duration of effective plasma concentration . the impact of food on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dexlansoprazole mr was evaluated in 46 healthy subjects who completed all dosing regimens in a randomized , 4-period , open - label , crossover study.23 placebo was administered in 4 regimens : after a 10-hour fast , 30 minutes before , 5 minutes before , or 30 minutes after a high - fat breakfast on day 1 ; dexlansoprazole mr 90 mg was administered in the same fashion for each crossover period on day 3 . plasma concentrations of dexlansoprazole were measured on day 3 and 24-hour intragastric ph was assessed on days 1 and 3 . pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole in the fed conditions ( administered 5 minutes before and 30 minutes after a high - fat breakfast ) when compared to the fasted state displayed at least a 1.09-fold greater increase ( using the point estimates ) in cmax and auc for the fed state ( figure 3 ) . the data also showed that the systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole after dexlansoprazole mr was administered 30 minutes before a high - fat breakfast was bioequivalent to that obtained following administration of dexlansoprazole mr under fasted state . the differences in the pharmacodynamic parameters measured as mean 24-hour intragastric ph and % time 24-hour intragastric ph > 4 were not considered to be clinically meaningful between any of the periods which signified both a lack of food effect and a lack of effect of timing of food intake relative to dosing with dexlansoprazole mr on intragastric ph profile . because ppi are traditionally administered before the morning meal , it is important to determine if a ppi with extended release properties such as dexlansoprazole mr can be taken at different times during the day which may offer greater dosing flexibility . the influence of time of day of dexlansoprazole mr administration on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables was assessed in 44 healthy subjects who completed all regimens in a 4-period , randomized , crossover fashion in which drug was administered daily for five days 30 minutes before breakfast , lunch , dinner , or a bedtime snack . plasma drug concentrations and 24-hour intragastric ph were assessed on day 5 of each period.24 systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole when dosed before breakfast was bioequivalent when dosed before lunch , dinner or an evening snack , and minimal but statistically significant differences were found in mean 24-hour intragastric ph between dosing at breakfast and at lunch ( 0.2 difference in ph ) and in % time 24-hour intragastric ph > 4 between dosing at breakfast and at bedtime snack ( 7% difference ) . no other significant differences in 24-hour intragastric ph were found between breakfast and the other mealtimes . therefore , the dosing versatility of dexlansoprazole mr appears to extend beyond the lack of an effect by food into the realm of dose timing flexibility . the impact of dose timing on the pharmacodynamic effects of other ppi has been previously studied . rabeprazole dose timing was studied in a crossover fashion in 20 gerd patients , and a significantly greater % time intragastric ph > 4 was observed when the dose was given once daily in the morning vs the evening.25 dosing lansoprazole in the morning produced no differences in intragastric ph ( mean 24-h ph or % time ph > 4 ) than evening dosing in healthy subjects in one study.26 however , morning dosing of lansoprazole in another study was significantly more effective than evening dosing at intragastric ph control for all time periods during the day except for overnight , when the two dosing methods were comparable.27 an alternative method of dexlansoprazole administration was studied in 50 healthy subjects in a two - period , randomized , crossover study where dexlansoprazole mr 90 mg was ingested after a 10-hour fasting period as either an intact capsule with water or after the capsule was opened and the granules were sprinkled over applesauce and swallowed.28 no significant differences in either auc or cmax were found between the two methods , and bioequivalence was established for dexlansoprazole mr regardless of whether given whole with water or sprinkled over applesauce . drug interactions remain a potential concern for any compound that undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism , including ppi . four separate studies were conducted in healthy subjects in which dexlansoprazole mr 90 mg was given once daily for 9 to 11 days with a single dose of a test substrate . the test substrates for the in vivo assessment of cyp enzyme activity included diazepam 5 mg ( a substrate for cyp2c19 and cyp3a ) , phenytoin 250 mg ( cyp2c9 and cyp2c19 ) , theophylline ( given as intravenous aminophylline 400 mg , cyp1a2 ) , and warfarin 25 mg ( cyp2c9).29 no significant differences in cmax or auc of any substrate were detected when given concomitantly with dexlansoprazole mr . furthermore , the pharmacodynamic impact of coadministration of dexlansoprazole mr with warfarin as measured by change in inr was not significant . therefore , no significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic ( for warfarin only ) drug  drug interactions were found in these studies with dexlansoprazole mr . at the time of this review no studies have been conducted with dexlansoprazole and clopidogrel , so the effect of the two drugs when given together is unknown . due to complete metabolism in the liver to inactive metabolites and the absence of unchanged drug excreted in the urine , dexlansoprazole mr is not expected to undergo accumulation in kidney dysfunction , and no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment . accumulation of dexlansoprazole concentrations occurred in subjects with moderate ( child pugh class b ) hepatic impairment , but not in mild impairment ( child pugh class a).30 due to this finding , studies were not conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment . thus , the lower dexlansoprazole mr dose of 30 mg should be considered in moderate hepatic impairment , and no dosage adjustment is required in mild impairment . the clinical development program for dexlansoprazole mr was the largest for any ppi to date and comprised 6 pivotal studies in more than 4500 patients . the goals of this program were to establish the efficacy and safety of dexlansoprazole mr in the treatment and maintenance of erosive esophagitis and in the control of symptomatic nonerosive gerd . two identically designed trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of dexlansoprazole mr vs lansoprazole in the healing of erosive esophagitis.33 both trials were randomized and double - blinded and compared dexlansoprazole mr 60 mg and 90 mg with lansoprazole 30 mg once daily . all doses were given once daily within 60 minutes of the morning meal to maintain blinding , and the duration of treatment was 8 weeks . all patients were adults ( age > 18 years ) with endoscopically proven erosive esophagitis . exclusion criteria included the presence of helicobacter pylori infection or barrett s esophagus . esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( egd ) was performed at baseline ( to establish the presence of esophageal erosions ) and at 4 and 8 weeks . the primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with endoscopic evidence of healing at 8 weeks , and secondary endpoints included the percentage of subjects with moderate - to - severe ( los angeles [ la ] grades c and d ) erosive esophagitis who were healed at 8 weeks , and all grades healed at 4 weeks . the target proportion of patients with la grade c and d disease was 30% as consistent with fda guidance that this subgroup of disease presents specific challenges to healing . the symptoms of erosive esophagitis were recorded by diary twice daily : upon awakening each morning to capture any symptoms experienced overnight and upon retiring each evening to capture any symptoms experienced while awake . the rigor of this recording method was intended to minimize the recall bias that may arise from once daily symptom recording . the primary method of analysis of the healing rate was the crude rate ; this analysis method classifies any subject who does not complete the study ( eg , no data for week 8 endoscopy ) as a complete treatment failure . this is in contrast to life - table analysis , the statistical methodology historically used in ppi trials , in which the probability is calculated that a patient would have healed had he remained in the study and received the final egd . as such , in life - table analysis the patient who does not complete the trial is considered a partial failure . the crude rate is an inherently more stringent analysis method , and typically yields lower healing rates than life - table . both dexlansoprazole mr erosive esophagitis healing trials were designed to test for noninferiority ; the dexlansoprazole mr doses shown to be noninferior were then tested for superiority to lansoprazole 30 mg for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints . for each study , a sample size of 520 patients per treatment group provided at least 95% power at the 0.025 level of significance to detect noninferiority between dexlansoprazole mr and lansoprazole , assuming equal healing rates of 87% at week 8 . erosive esophagitis healing rates at week 8 for both dexlansoprazole mr doses were superior to lansoprazole in one study ( study 1 ) ; 60 mg of dexlansoprazole mr was noninferior and 90 mg was superior to lansoprazole in the other study ( figure 4 ) . healing at week 4 was > 64% for all groups using both crude rate and life - table analysis methods . healing of moderate - to - severe erosive esophagitis was significantly greater with dexlansoprazole mr 60 mg than lansoprazole in study 1 and both doses were noninferior to lansoprazole in study 2 . the median percentage of 24-hour heartburn - free days was greater than 80% in patients who received either dose of dexlansoprazole mr ; this was comparable to lansoprazole . subjects who experienced healing of erosive esophagitis in either of the two healing studies mentioned previously were eligible for enrollment in one of two studies designed to evaluate the maintenance of healing over a 6-month period . one study compared dexlansoprazole mr 30 mg and 60 mg with placebo34 and the other study compared 60 mg and 90 mg doses with placebo.35 the placebo - controlled design was consistent with the standard comparator of other esophagitis healing maintenance studies . the final endoscopy of the previous healing study was considered the baseline assessment of healing for this maintenance study and was followed by endoscopies at 1 , 3 , and 6 months to document persistence of healing . the primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects who maintained healed erosive esophagitis at 6 months . secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of days without daytime or nighttime heartburn and the percentage of nights without heartburn . symptoms were recorded by subjects twice daily in a manner identical to the erosive esophagitis healing studies . the enrollment of the study that compared dexlansoprazole mr 30 mg and 60 mg with placebo was 445 subjects , and the withdrawal rate from study medication was 83% for the placebo group and 34% for each dexlansoprazole mr group , mostly due to relapse of erosive esophagitis . maintenance of healing rates were significantly higher for both dexlansoprazole mr doses compared to placebo , and this finding was consistent for all grades of erosive esophagitis and for moderate - to - severe disease . the median percentage of 24-hour heartburn - free days and median percentage of nights without heartburn was statistically significantly higher for all doses of dexlansoprazole mr than placebo , with 96% of 24-hour periods and 99% of nights being reported as heartburn - free over 6 months for dexlansoprazole mr 30 mg vs 29% of 24-hour periods and 72% of nights for placebo ( figure 5 ) . the control of nonerosive gerd symptoms remains a therapeutic challenge for practitioners , because the true etiology of the symptoms may or may not be due to acid or may be unknown . a clinical trial compared two different doses of dexlansoprazole mr ( 30 and 60 mg ) with placebo in subjects with normal esophageal mucosa on egd.36 this study identified patients with heartburn - predominant complaints for at least 6 months and for 4 of the 7 days prior to screening for enrollment , but no minimal severity of symptoms was required . besides egd , no objective assessments of esophageal disease such as ph - metry were conducted and no attempts were made to identify or exclude patients with functional heartburn . study medication was administered in a blinded fashion once daily in the morning for 28 days . subjects recorded heartburn symptom assessments twice daily as described for the erosive esophagitis healing and maintenance studies , and investigator assessments occurred at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks of the study . the primary endpoint was the percentage of 24-hour periods that were free of heartburn symptoms over 28 days , and the secondary endpoint was the percentage of daytime periods and nighttime periods without heartburn . the results demonstrated that a majority of the 24-hour periods were heartburn - free in the groups that received dexlansoprazole mr ( median percentage 54.9% for the 30 mg group ) compared with 18.5% for the placebo group ( figure 6 ) . the dexlansoprazole mr 30 mg group also experienced significantly greater nighttime periods ( median percentage of nights 80.8% vs 51.7% for placebo ) and daytime periods ( median percentage of days 63.0% vs 26.9% for placebo ) that were symptom - free . it is important to note that no nighttime symptom requirement was necessary for enrollment into the study ; this may partially explain the relatively large placebo response for this endpoint . the percentage of patients during the study who experienced 24-hour heartburn - free days over the first 3 days of treatment was significantly greater for dexlansoprazole mr treatment groups than placebo . the percentage of patients with 24-hour heartburn - free days by each study day is presented in figure 7 . two identically designed trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of dexlansoprazole mr vs lansoprazole in the healing of erosive esophagitis.33 both trials were randomized and double -

free days over the first 3 days of treatment was significantly greater for dexlansoprazole mr treatment groups than placebo . the percentage of patients with 24-hour heartburn - free days by each study day is presented in figure 7 . the safety and tolerability of dexlansoprazole mr was evaluated in more than 4500 patients in seven trials of the phase 3 clinical development program . treatment - emergent adverse events were reported in which any such event that occurred after the ingestion of the first dose of study medication was recorded and analyzed . the strictness of this reporting method contrasts with reporting of treatment - related events which requires the investigator to deem an adverse event to be related to the study medication in order to be reported . the most commonly reported treatment - emergent adverse events ( with a frequency of 2% ) from all clinical studies of dexlansoprazole mr are presented in table 1 . diarrhea was the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation form dexlansoprazole therapy in controlled clinical studies ( 0.7%).20 the elevation of plasma gastrin concentrations by ppi is a well - established class effect that is due to the compensatory increase in afferent hormonal input of parietal cell acid production . the trophic effects of gastrin on the gastric mucosa and evidence of ecl - cell hyperplasia in animals have led to potential controversy about the long - term use of ppi in humans . mean plasma gastrin auc24 increased by approximately 3.5-fold compared with baseline values after 5 days of dosing with dexlansoprazole mr 90 mg or 120 mg ; this magnitude of increase was similar to that of lansoprazole 30 mg in a crossover study in healthy subjects.37 gastrin parameters started to decline within 3 days after drug discontinuation , and returned to baseline within 7 days after the last dose of drug . thus , the changes in gastrin associated with dexlansoprazole mr appeared to be modest , reversible , unrelated to dose , and similar to other ppi . elevations in serum gastrin concentrations were higher in the dexlansoprazole mr groups than in the lansoprazole group in the erosive esophagitis healing studies , but were within the expected range for ppi.33 gastrin elevations also occurred in all dexlansoprazole mr groups in the maintenance and nonerosive gerd studies compared to placebo.34,36 these elevations were also within the range expected for patients receiving ppi . gastric biopsies obtained at the final visit in patients enrolled in either of the maintenance of erosive esophagitis studies revealed no findings of neuroendocrine cell proliferation or adenocarcinoma.34,35 finally , no changes in the cardiac rhythm ( including q - t interval ) were detected in healthy volunteers who received a single dose of dexlansoprazole mr 90 mg or 300 mg.38 no consistent , clinically important changes in laboratory results , vital signs , or physical examinations were observed . dexlansoprazole mr is a ppi administered by a unique delivery system that extends the duration of active plasma concentrations of drug beyond conventional ppi . it is available in two dosage strengths , 30 and 60 mg , and is currently approved for 3 clinical indications : healing of erosive esophagitis at a dose of 60 mg orally once daily for up to 8 weeks , maintenance of erosive esophagitis healing at a dose of 30 mg orally once daily for up to 6 months , and relief of symptomatic nonerosive gerd at a dose of 30 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks . in 2 large active - control studies of dexlansoprazole mr it showed healing rates of all grades of erosive esophagitis consistent with lansoprazole , and this healing was maintained for up to 6 months in nearly two - thirds of patients at either dose in another placebo - controlled study . in addition , dexlansoprazole mr provided complete relief of heartburn symptoms for a median of 55% of 24-hour periods over 28 days in patients with symptomatic nonerosive gerd . the safety profile of dexlansoprazole because dexlansoprazole mr can be taken without regard to food or time of day it is more convenient for individuals who find compliance with meal - associated dosing of medication difficult or eat at irregular times . the prolonged duration of acid suppression provided by dexlansoprazole mr addresses the short half - life of conventional ppi and offers a novel approach to extending gastric ph control in patients with selected acid - related disorders .","although proton pump inhibitors ( ppi ) have a record of remarkable effectiveness and safety in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) , several treatment challenges with ppi have emerged . 
 dexlansoprazole mr is the ( r)-enantiomer of lansoprazole contained in a formulation that produces two distinct releases of drug and significantly extends the duration of active plasma concentrations and % time ph > 4 beyond that of conventional single - release ppi . 
 dexlansoprazole mr can be administered without regard to meals or the timing of meals in most patients . 
 dexlansoprazole mr 60 mg demonstrated similar efficacy for healing of erosive esophagitis at 8 weeks compared with lansoprazole 30 mg , and dexlansoprazole mr 30 mg was superior to placebo for maintenance of healed erosive esophagitis at 6 months with 99% of nights and 96% of days heartburn - free over 6 months in patients taking dexlansoprazole mr 30 mg . 
 superior relief of heartburn occurred in patients taking dexlansoprazole mr 30 mg ( 55% heartburn - free 24-hour periods ) vs placebo ( 14% ) for symptomatic nonerosive gerd . 
 the safety profile of dexlansoprazole mr is similar to that of lansoprazole . 
 the extended pharmacodynamic effects , added convenience , and efficacy and safety of dexlansoprazole mr offer a novel approach to gastric ph control in patients with acid - related disorders .",329
"neuropathic pain is a chronic pain defined as a pain caused by damages to or dysfunction of somatosensory system and can expresses itself in the following forms : allodynia , hyperalgesia , and spontaneous pain ( 1 ) . along with causing changes to nervous system , neuropathic pain can decrease physical activity levels ( 2 , 3 ) . furthermore , neuropathic pain can affect structure and function of muscles through muscular atrophy ( 4 , 5 ) . many studies have proven that models of neuropathic pains will be followed with muscle atrophy ( 5 - 8 ) .   however , exact cellular mechanisms , which cause changes after nervous damages are still unknown ( 8) . cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdks ) are serine / threonine protein kinases that play key roles in the regulation of cell cycle , initiation of transcription , and control of certain metabolic cascades in mammalian cells ( 9 , 10 ) . cdks activity has a vital role in different functions of nerve cells such as neuronal growth and migration , cell secretion , dopamine signaling , and cytoskeletal dynamics ( 10 ) . glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( gsk3 ) is also a serine / threonine kinase that exists in two isoforms of alpha and beta ( 11 ) and participate in the modulation of various functions such as cell signaling , growth metabolism , and many other transcriptional regulating survival and death factors in organisms ( 12 ) . in general , cdk5 and gsk-3 are two of the most important protein kinases involved in neuropathic pain signaling ( 13 , 14 ) . furthermore , the role of these two proteins in the regulation of muscle plasticity has been clearly proved . for example , it has been shown that gsk-3 is necessary in myofibrillar protein loss system and its reduction causes preserving of contractile protein against proteolysis ( 15 ) . cdk5 also has a key role in skeletal muscle s structure and its function so that it is effective in changing muscle phonotype and essentially these changes come from its effects on cytoskeleton proteins structure such as actin and microtubules and regulation of myogenesis ( 16 , 17 ) . on the other hand , changes to expression of cdk5 and gsk-3 in muscular and nervous systems after numerous interferences infer such an insight that related systems change through following conditions : chronic state of motor unit activity , afferent activity level toward motor neurons , number of innervated muscle fibers by motor neurons , and metabolic level of target tissue . we set the goal of this study on considering the effects of decreased activity in the form of neuropathic pain caused by ligation of the l5 spinal nerve on cdk5 and gsk-3 gene expression in soleus muscle of wistar male rats . in the present study , 12 mature 10-week - old wistar male rats , weighted 200 - 240 g were provided by animal maintenance unit of razi research center ( razi institute animal center , karaj , iran ) and transferred to animal laboratory of tarbiat modares university . all rats were kept under a controlled environment condition with mean temperature of 22  3c , dark - light cycle of 12:12 hours , relative humidity of 40% and free access to food and water ad libitum . the experimental protocols to perform this study were approved by the ethics committee on the use of animals of tarbiat modares university , tehran , iran . all efforts were made to minimize discomfort of the animals and reduce the number of experimental animals . all procedures conformed to the ethical guidelines regarding the care and use of laboratory animals , published by the international association for the study of pain and the national institutes of health . after two weeks of acclimatization of the animals with new environment , experimental protocols were initiated and the rats were randomly ( simple randomization ) allocated in 3 groups ( 4 rats in each group ) : ( 1 ) tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve ( snl : n = 4 ) ; ( 2 ) sham surgery ( sham : n = 4 ) , and ( 3 ) control ( c : n = 4 ) . calculated sample size by the following equation resulted resulted in 3 animals in each group : where z = 1.96 , z = 0.84 , sd = 0.18 and d = 0.4 . then , l5 spinal nerve was tightly ligated according to the method of kim and chung ( 1992 ) ( 18 ) . briefly , the left paraspinal muscles were separated at l5-s2 level and the left transverse process of l6 vertebra was removed . the left l5 spinal nerve was identified and gently separated from adjacent l4 spinal nerve . then , l5 spinal nerve was tightly ligated using silk threads ( 6/0 ) and was transected just distal to ligature to ensure that all fibers were interrupted . next , the wound was closed with silk threads ( 3/0 ) . sham group , the surgical procedure was identical to that described above , except for the left l5 spinal nerve that was not ligated and transected . only animals showing no signs of motor deficiencies were considered to be used for further experimentations , those animals without neuropathic pains in their behavioral tests . then the rats were divided in 3 groups with 5 members in each : non - operated , sham , and neuropathic pain ( snl ) groups . after 4 weeks , rats were anesthetized by injecting intraperitoneal ketamine ( 90 ml / kg ) and xylazine ( 10 ml / kg ) and the muscle tissue samples were separated from the left soleus muscle and situated in -80c nitrogen for future analysis . radiation heat apparatus was used to measure hyperalgesia in which the middle part of animal s paw from plexiglas level was exposed to thermal constant radiations and paw withdraw threshold time ( pwts ) was calculated . heat excitations repeated 3 times , with 5 to 10 minutes intervals . to measure the mechanical allodynia , animal was located on the wired network and inside the plexiglas capsule with 20  20  30 cm dimensions . after acclimatization with new environment , von frey fibers with weight range of 2 to 60 g ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 15 , 26 , and 60 g ) ( manufactured by stolting inc . ) were used . the experiment started with the lightest fiber and in the non - response cases , heavier fibers were gradually employed . for excitation initiation , each fiber was inserted into animal s paw in 3 consecutive times for 1 s with 5 s intervals . if we had positive response ( animal raising its foot ) in 2 consecutive performances , that weight of fiber would have been selected as the response threshold . if animal had no response to all of the fibers , number 60 would have been considered as the response threshold ( 19 ) . soleus muscles from the left leg were quantitatively dissected from the bone , immediately weighed , and frozen at 20c . later , these muscles were lyophilized and weighed for their dry weight . after excision of muscles , the left tibia was removed and freed from connective tissue , and the maximal length was measured . ( 20 ) showed that expressing muscle mass per unit of tibial length is a valid way to normalize mass when body weight differs between experimental groups . rna extraction was done by qlazol lysis reagent ( germany , qiagen ) and chloroform ( germany , qiagen ) according to manufacturer s instructions . so , about 50 mg of the muscle tissue was separately homogenized in 1 to 10 portions in qlazol lysis reagent for total rna extraction and removing protein components . then , it mixed with chloroform in 1 to 5 portions and was shaken severely for 15 s. then the supernatant was centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 minutes at 4c and its water and mineral part were removed . finally , its rna contained portion was removed and mixed with isopropanol in 1 to 5 portions . it was left for 10 minutes at room temperature and then centrifuged at 12000 g at 4c for 10 minutes . rna concentration was measured by uv spectrophotometry method ( eppendorf , germany ) , and 260 to 280 portions in 1.8 - 2 were determined as the desired purification . cdna synthesis was done by using quanti tect reverse transcription kit ( qiagen , germany ) in accordance to the manufacturer s manual . real - time pcr quantity method was used by premix sybr green ii ( qiagen , germany ) for measuring cdk5 and gsk-3 mrna expression levels ( applied biosystems stepone , america ) . reaction mixture was done in final volume in 20 l ( includes 1 l of cdna , 1 l of forward primer , 1 l of reverse primer , 7 l of depc water and 10 l of syber green ) and each reaction in duplicate . designing of primers was done according to cdk5 , gsk-3 and gapdh genes in gene bank of ncbi and by german company , qiagen . furthermore , gapdh was used as the reference gene . thermal program used in real time - pcr included : 95c for 10 minutes , 95c for 15 s , 60c for 1 min ( 40 cycle repetitions ) . melt curve and standard curve were drawn and considered for evaluating data authenticity and optimization experiment conditions , respectively and cdk5 and gsk-3 expression data were normalized using gapdh ( reference gene ) . abbreviations : for , forward ;

( 2 ) sham surgery ( sham : n = 4 ) , and ( 3 ) control ( c : n = 4 ) . calculated sample size by the following equation resulted resulted in 3 animals in each group : where z = 1.96 , z = 0.84 , sd = 0.18 and d = 0.4 . then , l5 spinal nerve was tightly ligated according to the method of kim and chung ( 1992 ) ( 18 ) . briefly , the left paraspinal muscles were separated at l5-s2 level and the left transverse process of l6 vertebra was removed . the left l5 spinal nerve was identified and gently separated from adjacent l4 spinal nerve . then , l5 spinal nerve was tightly ligated using silk threads ( 6/0 ) and was transected just distal to ligature to ensure that all fibers were interrupted . next sham group , the surgical procedure was identical to that described above , except for the left l5 spinal nerve that was not ligated and transected . only animals showing no signs of motor deficiencies were considered to be used for further experimentations , those animals without neuropathic pains in their behavioral tests . then the rats were divided in 3 groups with 5 members in each : non - operated , sham , and neuropathic pain ( snl ) groups . after 4 weeks , rats were anesthetized by injecting intraperitoneal ketamine ( 90 ml / kg ) and xylazine ( 10 ml / kg ) and the muscle tissue samples were separated from the left soleus muscle and situated in -80c nitrogen for future analysis . radiation heat apparatus was used to measure hyperalgesia in which the middle part of animal s paw from plexiglas level was exposed to thermal constant radiations and paw withdraw threshold time ( pwts ) was calculated . heat excitations repeated 3 times , with 5 to 10 minutes intervals . to measure the mechanical allodynia , animal was located on the wired network and inside the plexiglas capsule with 20  20  30 cm dimensions . after acclimatization with new environment , von frey fibers with weight range of 2 to 60 g ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 15 , 26 , and 60 g ) ( manufactured by stolting inc . ) were used . the experiment started with the lightest fiber and in the non - response cases , heavier fibers were gradually employed . for excitation initiation , each fiber was inserted into animal s paw in 3 consecutive times for 1 s with 5 s intervals . if we had positive response ( animal raising its foot ) in 2 consecutive performances , that weight of fiber would have been selected as the response threshold . if animal had no response to all of the fibers , number 60 would have been considered as the response threshold ( 19 ) . soleus muscles from the left leg were quantitatively dissected from the bone , immediately weighed , and frozen at 20c . after excision of muscles , the left tibia was removed and freed from connective tissue , and the maximal length was measured .

 cdk5 mrna levels were down regulated and gsk-3 mrna levels were up regulated . all rats that received l5 snl developed mechanical and heat hypersensitivity on the ipsilateral hind paw . as shown in figure 1 and 2 , pwt as well as pwl in the snl group were lower postoperatively on the first , second , third and fourth weeks ( p < 0.05 versus sham group ) , indicating that mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia has been induced by snl operation . pwt decreased in the snl rats postoperatively on the first , second , third and fourth weeks ( p < 0.05 versus sham group ) . pwt decreased in the snl rats postoperatively on the first , second , third , and fourth weeks ( p < 0.05 versus sham group ) . data are presented as mean  sd , which indicate significant differences with other groups ( p < 0.05 ) . for the gapdh ( 186 bp ) , cdk5 ( 210 bp ) , and gsk-3 ( 206 bp ) genes , m = 100-bp dna ladder . data are presented as mean  sd , which indicate significant differences with other groups ( p < 0.05 ) . data are presented as mean  sd , which indicate significant differences with other groups ( p < 0.05 ) . weight of the soleus muscle decreased in snl rats and this result indicates muscular atrophy as a consequence of tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve ( figure 3 ) . to elucidate the possible regulation of cdk5 and gsk-3 at mrna level in rat models with neuropathic pain , we examined cdk5 and gsk-3 at mrna level in soleus muscle after 4 weeks of tight ligation of l5 spinal nerves . agarose gel electrophoresis presented a single band with the expected size ( figure 4 ) and as indicated in figure 5 and 6 
 cdk5 mrna levels were down regulated and gsk-3 mrna levels were up regulated . candidate gene selection followed by decreased activity in neuropathic pain form studies is greatly influenced by the current knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this disease . in the present study , it was observed that decreased activity in form of tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve causes decreased cdk5 mrna gene expression in soleus muscle , while amount of gsk-3 mrna gene expression increases . moreover , we show that tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve causes soleus muscle atrophy that could be attributed to this changes . intracellular signaling cascades , which result in immediate early gene induction and maintenance , can control widespread changes in gene and protein expression . careful study in the relationship of different gene regulations is important for further understanding of pathogenesis of neuropathic pain . previous studies showed that neuropathic pain increased cdk5 protein ( 22 ) and decreased gsk-3 protein ( 23 ) . however , they did not show whether this increase in cdk5 protein levels and decrease in gsk-3 protein levels are due to the changes in their mrna or degradation . the present data led us to conclude that down regulation of cdk5 and up regulation of gsk-3 may cause decrease and increase in their protein level , respectively , a conclusion that previously reported by others . such decreases in the activity cause inability in physical fitness , increase in blood pressure , and decrease in musculoskeletal functions . improper physical activity leads to structural and functional reduction of skeletal muscle ( 24 ) . besides , damages to motor neurons lead to many morphological and biochemical changes in muscles ( 25 , 26 ) . spinal cord injury is related to atrophy and decrease in the size of muscle mass , which pathologists related it to nerve damages and decrease in activity and movement because of pain existence ( 27 ) . decreased activity because of hyperalgesia and allodynia increases proteolysis and decreases protein synthesis in muscles ( 28 ) . furthermore , existing evidence shows that tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve causes limitation but not complete inhibition of muscle electrical activity . ( 1997 ) ( 29 ) showed that by exciting motor neurons of l4 segment , only 30% of maximum generated force of soleus muscle was recruited ; however , by exciting motor neuron of l5 segment , 70% of maximum generated force of the muscle was recruited . denervation causes effective intracellular environment changes , decrease in muscle mass , number and volume of mitochondria , and increase in apoptosis proteins ( 30 ) . cdk5 activity and its receptor ( p35 ) in afferent neurons are very important in understanding the reason for its acute pain ( 14 ) . in muscles , cdk5 expression is very necessary in its natural amount and unnatural cdk5 expression in non - nervous cells . both expressions are done mainly through its direct or indirect effects on organizing cytoskeleton structures such as actin and microtubules , which seems to cause such structure changes and these changes on cytoskeleton structure leads to cellular disorders and disease ( 16 ) . ( 2002 ) ( 26 ) reported cdk5 expression in skeletal muscles of rats after nervous damages showed an unnatural increase , which followed by increase in acetilcoline receptors in neuromuscular junction . differences in the findings of the present study to that of fu and his colleagues can be due to different denervation methods . however , both unnatural decrease and increase in cdk5 expression can be related to some complications and diseases ( 17 , 31 ) . on the other hand , gsk-3 is an enzyme with the ability to do several tasks and involved in numerous cellular processes . along with its metabolic role , gsk-3 is involved in maintenance and plasticity of skeletal muscle ( 15 ) . it has been shown that in pain receptors , gsk-3 has a role in morphine bearing and modulation of its pain relieving effects ( 13 ) . in muscular tissue , gsk-3 has a key role in regulation of muscle atrophy ( 33 , 34 ) . also it has been shown that inhibition of gsk-3 causes decrease in muscular atrophy ( 33 ) and in absence of gsk-3 , myofibrils are protected against atrophy ( 15 ) . gsk-3 controls expression of atrogin-1 and murf1 ( muscle ring finger-1 ) due to effects of atrophy activators . expression of atrogin-1 and murf1 in response to igf-1 ( insulin - like growth factor-1 ) or insulin , which are protein synthesis activators , decreases ( 35 ) . ( 2005 ) ( 33 ) reported that atrogin-1 and murf1 levels decrease by inhibiting gsk-3 drugs while in absence of gsk-3 , dexamethasone injection ( which is an industrial glucocorticoid that its injection causes induction of proteolysis ) modulates amount of myofibrillar atrophy . activation of signaling cascades of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( pi-3k)/protein kinase b ( akt ) is due to insulin or igf - i effects ( the main regulators of gsk-3 activity ) , which causes akt activation / protein kinase b ( pkb ) directly through gsk-3 phosphorylation ( 36 , 37 ) . akt blockage causes increase in gsk-3 activity and obvious increase in atrogin-1 and murf1 levels ( 35 , 38 ) . phosphorylated - akt activates ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) mtor 1 complex and inactivates gsk-3 simultaneously that leads to increase in mrna transcription and protein synthesis capacity ( 39 , 40 ) . akt decreases gsk-3 activity through phosphorylation and leads to increased expression of mrna derived from eif2b ( eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2b ) increased activity because of decreased inhibition of eif2b through gsk-3 ( 41 ) . gsk-3 has an important role in regulation of protein synthesis and muscular hypertrophy ( 42 ) . however , acute decrease in gsk-3 of contractile proteins maintains proteolysis of contractile proteins more than excitation of protein synthesis . initiation of protein transcription is apparently the time - limiting stage in muscular protein synthesis and controlled mainly by eukaryote initiation factors ( eifs ) . activated gsk-3 is responsible for eif2b inhibition , which eventually causes decrease in the initiation of protein synthesis . on the other hand , inactivation of gsk-3 by upstream kinase of it , akt , causes decrease of eif2b phosphorylation and facilitation of transcription initiation of mrna ( 41 ) . it was shown that akt is the critical point in signaling cascade of hypertrophy and atrophy ( 38 ) . akt was activated after activation of a series of intracellular signaling cascades like igf-1 and pi3k ( phosphatidylinositol-4 , 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase ) ( 43 ) . downstream target of akt is gsk-3 , which is phosphorylated and inactivated ( 44 ) and as a consequence , eif2b would be exited from its inhibitive state ( 45 ) . akt may take part in muscular atrophy involvement processes ; it is also probable that muscular atrophy will be followed by phosphorylated akt reduction ( 46 ) . in the present study , it was shown that decreased activity and tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve in neuropathic pain cause decrease and increase in cdk5 and gsk-3 mrna levels , respectively and these changes are followed by pain - related disorders and soleus muscle atrophy . generally increase in gsk-3 may be related to muscular atrophy and decrease in protein synthesis , while decreases in cdk5 expression is related to structural disorders and function of skeletal muscle . thus , it is likely that increased activity in the form of strength and endurance training can contradict unnatural expression of these two proteins in this kind of neuropathic pain . ( 2013 ) ( 47 ) showed that abovementioned types of training can lead to optimization of cdk5 expression in brain . however , leger et al . ( 2006 ) ( 46 ) reported increased activity in form of 8 weeks strength training causes muscular hypertrophy by increasing phosphorylated state of akt , gsk-3 , mtor proteins .","background : the relationship between decreased activity / neuropathic pain and gene expression alterations in soleus muscle has remained elusive.objectives:in this experimental study , we investigated the effects of decreased activity in neuropathic pain form on cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) and glycogen synthase kinase-3  ( gsk-3 ) gene expression in soleus muscle of rats.materials and methods : twelve male wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups : ( 1 ) tight ligation of the l5 spinal nerve ( snl : n = 4 ) ; ( 2 ) sham surgery ( sham : 
 n = 4 ) , and ( 3 ) control ( c : n = 4 ) . 
 the threshold to produce a withdrawal response to a mechanical and thermal stimulus was measured using von frey filaments and radiation heat apparatus , respectively . 
 following 4 weeks after surgery , the left soleus muscle was removed and mrna levels were determined by real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr).results : compared to control animals , l5 ligated animals developed mechanical and heat hypersensitivity during total period of study . 
 soleus muscle weight as well as cdk5 mrna levels ( less than ~ 0.4 fold ) was decreased and gsk-3 mrna levels ( up to ~ 7 folds ) increased in l5 ligated animals.conclusions:these results showed enhanced muscle atrophy processes following peripheral nerve damage and might provide a useful approach to study underlying muscle mechanisms associated with clinical neuropathic pain syndromes .",322
"the rna content of ev has been studied extensively ; however , only a handful of reports have characterized the dna content of ev . the reason for this could be attributed to gaps in the scientific literature in understanding how dna could be packaged inside ev . nevertheless , several groups have reported the presence of mtdna , ssdna , and dsdna from ev from various sources ( table 1 ) . the presence of mtdna , but not of genomic dna , was detected from ev from glioblastoma cells and astrocytes.4 however , upon dnase treatment of ev , it was found that a significant portion ( ~95% ) of mtdna detected was shown to be free dna attached to the surface of ev.4 in another study , ev from malignant tumor cells ( glioblastoma , medulloblastoma , atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor , and melanoma cells ) were found to contain ssdna , including genomic dna and retrotransposon elements.5 the ssdna detected from cancer cellderived ev was found to contain high levels of the cmyc oncogene . others have reported the presence of dsdna in ev from various cancer cell lines ( melanoma , breast , lung , prostate , pancreatic cancers ) , demonstrating that dsdna in ev could be a common feature of cancer cellderived ev that may be representative of the whole genomic dna.6 
  summary of dna detected from various ev sources ev , extracellular vesicle . the presence of dna in ev has sparked considerable interest in ev as novel mediators of horizontal gene transfer ( hgt ) . however , very little is known about the origin and biological significance of dna in ev . the mechanisms of dna packaging in ev are poorly understood and whether dna is packaged within the membranebound space of ev remains unclear . recent studies have revealed that dna is not contained within the membraneenclosed space of ev , but is largely attached to the outer surface of ev.7 , 8 indeed , treatment of ev with nucleases such as dnase i and exonuclease iii before dna extraction significantly reduces the overall dna detected from cancer cellderived ev ( yumi kawamura and takahiro ochiya , 2017 , personal observation ) , demonstrating that dna is mainly associated with the outer ev membrane ( fig . it has been suggested that the outer surface of ev are capable of interacting with various proteins , nucleic acids , and other surface membranes regulating their aggregation , motility in the circulation , and functionality in targeted sites.9 , 10 , 11 therefore , it is likely that dna associated with ev ( termed evdna ) may have some physiological significance in recipient cells and may play an important role , particularly in the cancer microenvironment . ( a ) hct116 ev were untreated or pretreated with dnase i , exonuclease iii , or rnase a , and extracted for dna and/or rna . ( b ) concentration of dna from hct116 ev was significantly reduced after treatment with exonuclease iii and dnase i. ( c ) rna concentration was unchanged after rnase a treatment of ev . the size of dna and rna extracted was measured with bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca , usa ) . ( d ) dna size was reduced after treatment with exonuclease iii and dnase i. ( e ) detection of small rna species in ev was unaffected by rnase a treatment , as indicated by red arrows . possible origins for evdna include cellfree dna ( cfdna ) found in apoptotic bodies,12 , 13 vesicles released by apoptotic cells,14 or cfdna attached to the surface of ev.7 , 15 circulating cfdna is mostly doublestranded , ranging from frequently observed size fragments of 180 bp to fragments larger than 10 000 bp.16 it is generally regarded that cfdna is released from dying cells during the process of apoptosis or necrosis , from both tumor and nontumor cells . studies have shown that the concentration of cfdna is increased in patients with cancer , in comparison to healthy individuals.17 interestingly , reduced dnase activity was observed from plasma samples of cancer patients , which may indicate impaired degradation and clearance of cfdna in cancer.18 taken together , reduced dnase activity in cancer could also be related to higher dna concentrations detected from cancer cellderived ev . given that cfdna from cancer patients can induce the oncogenic transformation of normal cells,19 cfdna on ev may carry substantial biological relevance in the tumor setting . previous reports have shown that exogenous dna associated with ev is taken up more efficiently than free dna , thereby suggesting that dna associated with ev may be involved in their uptake at recipient cells.20 in addition to this , it has been shown that cancer cellderived ev take part in premetastatic niche formation21 and show organotropism towards potential metastatic sites.22 these findings lead to an intriguing hypothesis that cancer cellderived evdna including oncogenes could be transported to potential sites of metastasis by ev , inducing tumorfavorable effects ( prometastatic effects ) such as genetic instability in recipient cells , eventually leading to the modulation of the cancer microenvironment and premetastatic niche formation . in fact , we have seen that dna associated with cancer cellderived ev contains the oncogenic kras mutation , which is reflective of the parental cell line ( fig . although it remains unclear whether dna associated with cancer cellderived ev is functional in evrecipient cells , under certain conditions , these oncogenic mutations may have the potential to transform normal cells . kras mutations are present in extracellular vesicle ( ev)dna from the hct116 cell line . dna was extracted from dnase i and exonuclease iiiuntreated hct116 ev and sequenced . both hct116 cell dna and evdna have the heterozygous mutation in the kras gene , a substitution of the g nucleotide to a at c.38 . however , the kras gene was not detected in evdna when hct116 ev were pretreated with dnase i before dna extraction . have assessed the ability of hgt by ev containing oncogenic sequences . in 2014 , they showed that dsdna fragments including fulllength hras could be incorporated in ev from hras transformed cell lines.23 however , a followup study by the same group demonstrated that ev containing oncogenic hras failed to permanently transform immortalized fibroblasts.24 these data indicate cellular defense mechanisms that prevent the delivery and integration of evdna into the genome of normal cells . as previous studies have shown that apoptotic bodies can horizontally transfer oncogenes such as hras and cmyc to neighboring cells deficient of p53,13 , 25 the integration of oncogenic sequences carried by ev could also be regulated by similar cellular defense mechanisms . deciphering the cellular conditions that would allow the integration of exogenous dna into the host genome would be important in understanding the extent to which ev can mediate the hgt of oncogenes and other exogenous dna to evrecipient cells . the disparities in dna detected from ev reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of ev populations . however , given the importance of ev in intercellular communication and their ability to transport genetic material to neighboring and distant cells , determining the origin and physiological significance of evdna could be relevant in understanding their functions in living systems . finally , the detection of dna from cancer cellderived ev may have potential uses as circulating biomarkers for detecting tumor dna from body fluids such as blood , urine , and saliva . another important feature of cancer cellderived ev is the discovery of retrotransposon elements . in 2011 , it was reported that cancer cellderived ev are highly enriched in retrotransposon elements including line1 ( l1 ) , alu and human endogenous retroviruses ( herv).5 this is an intriguing discovery as it indicates a new modality for retrotransposons to spread horizontally from one cell to another . retrotransposon elements , also known as  jumping genes ,  are mobile genetic elements that replicate through rna intermediates that are reverse transcribed and inserted into new genomic locations . following the complete sequencing of the human genome , it has been shown that more than 40% of the human genome is derived from retrotransposon elements.26 retrotransposons are capable of altering the genome by causing mutations , deletions and rearrangements , and their effects range from local genetic instability to largescale genomic variation . in somatic cells , however , active retrotransposition has been implicated in various diseases , and more than 70 diseases have been documented to be associated with heritable and somatic retrotransposition events.27 , 28 
  although the ability of retrotransposons to replicate and integrate into the host genome is well studied , the ability to transfer from one cell to another remains largely unknown . as these elements themselves are not infectious , it has been suggested that horizontal transmission would be unlikely without the involvement of a vector . in addition to this , others have pointed out the instability and rapid degradation of rna intermediates in the extracellular environment.29 the discovery of retrotransposon rna in ev may indicate an alternative mechanism for the intercellular transfer of retrotransposon elements . considering the protective features of ev and their ability to carry rna to neighboring and distant cells , this finding has important implications in understanding the mechanisms of somatic retrotransposition and the involvement of ev containing active retrotransposon elements in the development and spread of genetically influenced diseases . somatic l1 insertions have been found in the apc tumor suppressor locus in colorectal cancer,30 and within the myc locus in breast cancer.31 since then , wholegenome and exome sequencing studies have identified somatic retrotransposon insertions from colorectal , lung squamous , head and neck , and endometrial carcinomas.32 , 33 as indicated by these studies , somatic retrotransposon insertions are believed to play an important role in the tumorigenesis of various cancers . showed that ev can transfer retrotransposon rna to normal cells.5 however , the functional impact of retrotransposon transfer in evrecipient cells has not been reported . delivery of retrotransposons to distant sites , thereby avoiding immunerecognition in a tumor setting.34 given that active retrotransposon elements can yield extensive genomic insertions , further analysis will be important in observing the effects and activities of evmediated transfer of active retrotransposon elements in recipient cells . understanding this new biological concept will elucidate the spread of retrotransposons by ev and their potential involvement in the formation of genetic instability in target cells ( fig . 4 ) . proposed model of the horizontal transfer of genetic material by extracellular vesicles ( ev ) in the cancer microenvironment . genetic material such as oncogenic sequences and retrotransposon elements can be propagated by cancer cellderived ev . upon uptake at recipient cells , dna may be integrated into the genome of the recipient cell and cause phenotypic changes leading to niche expansion and tumor growth in neighboring cells , or the generation of the premetastatic niche at distant sites . retrotransposition events in neural progenitor cells have been shown to be important in the generation of genetic mosaicism that contributes to neuronal diversity and brain plasticity.35 however , accumulating evidence shows that the deregulation of retrotransposons may cause deleterious effects in neuronal genomes , which may lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases . altered levels of retrotransposon expression and increased retrotransposition insertions have been observed in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases . for instance , hyperactive retrotransposition and increased l1 copies have been reported in schizophrenia , alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) and parkinson 's disease ( pd ) . in addition to this , active herv have been identified in neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) , and have been associated with neuronal injury and death of motor neurons.36 , 37 however , it is still unclear how the deregulation of retrotransposon elements can cause neurodegenerative diseases . neurons are particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of dna damage as a result of their limited capacity for cell replacement in adulthood . the accumulation of dna lesions is considered to be a major contributor to ageassociated neurodegenerative diseases such as ad , as well as pd.38 , 39 , 40 in addition to this , impaired dna damage repair has been documented in many neurodegenerative diseases and is considered to be an important indication preceding neurodegeneration . 39 , 41 multiple dna repair molecules have been found to be mutated or deregulated in ad patients.41 dna lesions and double strand breaks ( dsb ) are particularly vulnerable to retrotransposon insertions,42 and are thought to be associated with increased retrotransposition events in neurodegenerative diseases.43 , 44 
  ev have been suggested to play a significant role in the dissemination of protein aggregates in the brain , such as amyloid and tau in ad , and synuclein in pd.45 , 46 the accumulation of pathogenic proteins has been associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases ( reviewed in47 ) . given that increased retrotransposition insertions in neurons are prominent in various neurodegenerative diseases , ev may also be responsible for the dissemination of not only deleterious proteins but also of genetic material such as deregulated retrotransposon elements . furthermore , accumulating evidence suggests that distinct mechanisms might be involved in the onset of disease , spread , and neuronal death.48 , 49 therefore , the development of neurological diseases could be modulated by various factors not limited to pathogenic protein aggregation in the brain . clinical studies have shown that the spread of neurodegenerative diseases follows stereotypical patterns , and may derive from a focus of genetically altered cells.50 the idea that the disease is initiated in a focal area suggests that somatic mosaicism may be responsible for the genetic changes in initiating cells . indeed , it has been suggested that somatic retrotransposition in neurons can cause mutations that may be involved in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.44 however , the mechanisms that underlie the spread of the disease from the initial focus to other regions of the brain remain to be fully determined . the role of ev in the spread of deleterious cargo may explain the anatomical spread of neurodegenerative diseases from one brain region to an adjacent region . considering that retrotransposons can act as insertional mutagens that can target dna dsb , it is plausible to hypothesize that the effects of ev containing active retrotransposon elements can exacerbate the spread of insertional mutagenesis in affected neurons , which may play a role in the potential spread of neurodegeneration . although the involvement of retrotransposons in ev and their activity in the progression of neurodegenerative disease has not been demonstrated so far , this finding would be important in understanding the spread of somatic retrotransposition in the brain . the analysis of evmediated transfer of active retrotransposons will add to the current understanding of the role of ev not only in the degeneration of neurons but also in the development and spread of various human diseases associated with deregulated retrotransposition events . the discovery of genetic elements in ev , in particular retrotransposon elements , signifies notable importance in understanding the mechanisms of genome evolution by exogenous genetic elements carried by ev . the horizontal transfer of retrotransposons has been critical in generating genome diversity that has led to the evolution of various organisms . genomewide comparisons of humans and other primate genomes have revealed the magnitude and significance of retrotransposon elements in human evolution.27 an example of horizontal transfer of retrotransposons is the case of bovb , an l1 retrotransposon that has been found to be widespread among mammalian species.51 however , the precise mechanisms regarding the transfer of retrotransposons between species remain largely unknown . the successful horizontal transfer of a retrotransposon requires the delivery of the rna intermediate , reverse transcription and integration into the host genome . it has been regarded that retrotransposons do not have the ability to infect other cells , and therefore would not be able to disperse horizontally across species without a vector involved . retroviruses , which have the ability to assemble virus particles that can exit the cell , have been proposed as potential vectors for the horizontal transfer of retrotransposons . recently , it was shown that ev are able to transfer hervk hml2 rna to normal cells , suggesting that a functional envelope gene may not be required for herv to infect other cells.5 this discovery raises the possibility of an evmediated mechanism for the dispersal of retrotransposons , and opens a new door into understanding their basic nature and scope in interspecies transfer . a recent review by nolte't hoen et al . discusses the many aspects in which ev resemble retroviruses . and retroviruses share similar structural aspects including size and buoyancy , but can also be similar in functional aspects , such as virus propagation . ev generated from virusinfected cells ( termed virusinduced ev ) have been shown to incorporate viral proteins and fragments of the viral genome , which can be transferred to target cells.52 the authors argue that virusinduced ev and viruslike particles are intermediate entities that are indistinguishable from one another . these intriguing similarities with retroviruses raise the possibility of ev as potential transporters of retrotransposon elements . moreover , intercellular communication by ev is not unique to eukaryotic cells . the release of membrane vesicles is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in eukaryotes , bacteria , and archaea , and is a basic feature in many organisms.53 in addition to this , the mechanistic strategies of ev release are similar , typically involving the highly conserved endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( escrt ) machinery , which are key components in the excision of membrane necks in the biogenesis of mvb , cytokinesis , and budding of enveloped viruses.54 , 55 , 56 the conserved feature of ev production and transmission may indicate their potential ability for interspecies transfer of genetic material . several reports have demonstrated the transfer of ev across species and their involvement in interspecies communication . the delivery of infectious agents by ev has been reported in host  pathogen interactions by intracellular and extracellular eukaryotic parasites57 and in human  fungal interactions.58 ev have also been implicated in plant  fungal interactions , in the secretion of virulence and defense molecules by both fungi and plants.59 furthermore , preliminary studies have shown that ev from food sources are taken up by intestinal macrophages and stem cells in humans , inducing the expression of target genes in recipient cells.60 the ability of ev to carry genetic material across species suggests their potential role in the transfer of exogenous genetic material into the human genome . further studies examining the distribution of genetic elements such as retrotransposons by evmediated mechanisms may consequently open up new ways of considering the functional impacts of ev in genome modulation , and will provide additional evidence for external influence on the evolution of the human genome . the presence of genetic material in ev has heightened considerable interest in their potential as mediators of hgt not only between cells in a single living organism , but also across different biological species . further studies assessing the functionality of genetic material in evrecipient cells will help to better define their roles as transgenomic agents and their involvement in modulating various cellular responses . ev are packaged with abundant cellular information ; however , the mechanisms that regulate ev cargo selection is still poorly understood . a deeper understanding of the biogenesis and cargo selection of ev may elucidate many of the biological processes that are regulated by ev , permitting an understanding of inter and intracellular communication by ev .","the composition of genetic material in extracellular vesicles ( ev ) has sparked interest particularly in the potential for horizontal gene transfer by ev . 
 although the rna content of ev has been studied extensively , few reports have examined the dna content of ev . 
 it is still unclear how dna is packaged inside ev , and whether they are functional in recipient cells . in this review , 
 we describe the biological significance of genetic material in ev and their possible impacts in recipient cells , with focus on dna from cancer cellderived ev and the potential roles they may play in the cancer microenvironment . 
 another important feature of the genetic content of ev is the presence of retrotransposon elements . in this review , 
 we discuss the possibility of an evmediated mechanism for the dispersal of retrotransposon elements , and their potential involvement in the development of genetically influenced diseases . 
 in addition to this , we discuss the potential involvement of ev in the transfer of genetic material across species , and their possible impacts in modulating genome evolution .",206
"ribonucleotide reductase ( rr ) inhibitors have been studied as radiation sensitizers for over 30  years in both the lab and the clinic . the first of these , hydroxyurea , has been studied in both cervical and head and neck cancers , among others . although initially promising , many of the clinical trials produced negative results , or those that were difficult to interpret . there has recently been a significant advance in our understanding of this pathway from a number of well - done pre - clinical studies . in addition , the discovery of new rr inhibitors with increased potency and improved binding characteristics has produced a significant increase in interest in this area . this review will synthesize the data detailing the response of rr to ionizing radiation ( ir ) and will provide a perspective on the use of rr inhibitors as radiosensitizers in the treatment of human cancers . over the years , many groups have explored the use of rr inhibitors as chemotherapeutics in their own right , or as adjuncts to dna damaging molecules , particularly in hematologic malignancies . while this area looks promising , this subject will not be reviewed here . ribonucleotide reductase is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis and repair of dna and is the only enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates , the fundamental building blocks of dna synthesis and repair . r1 ( also called rrm1 or m1 ) is the larger , regulatory subunit that is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle . it binds allosteric modulators , ribonucleoside diphosphates , and the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and fludarabine . there are currently two known smaller subunits that bind r1 to form the active enzyme ; r2 ( also called rrm2 or m2 ) and a more recently discovered p53 inducible homolog of the r2 subunit , known as p53r2 . both contain a tyrosine free radical stabilized by a non - heme iron complex that is critical in the reduction of ribonucleotides . r2 is known to be cell cycle regulated , with the highest levels during s phase , however the precise roles of the r2 and p53r2 subunit in the response to ir are an area of active debate , as outlined below ( figure 1 ) . given the pivotal role of rr in dna synthesis and repair , many studies have investigated the effect of dna damaging agents , including ir , on rr and its subunits . even so , there is currently still a great deal of controversy surrounding the exact mechanism of rr response to ir . the first is that the small subunit r2 is up - regulated and provides dntps for dna repair in addition to its usual role in dna synthesis during s phase . this is supported by a number of studies , including one by kuo et al . , who characterized the response of rr in the human cervical cancer cell line , caski . they demonstrated an increase in r2 protein levels after treating cells with ir , which was correlated with an increase in rr activity . however , there was no increase in the transcription of r2 , implying that the protein increase was due to post - transcriptional regulation ( kuo and kinsella , 1998 ) . this finding was reinforced by studies that demonstrated dna damage dependent stabilization of the r2 protein without any change in mrna after ir exposure in mouse balb/3t3 cells ( chabes and thelander , 2000 ) ; however it was in contrast to earlier work showing transcriptional activation of the r1 and r2 promoters after exposure to ir in the same cell line ( filatov et al . , 1996 ) . even though the precise mechanism of r2 response to ir damage is unclear , work has shown that human nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing r2 demonstrate a significant increase in radioresistance and fewer dna double strand breaks ( dsb ) after exposure to ir ( kuo et al . , 2003 ) , confirming the concept that r2 is important in the cellular response to ir the second theory involves the p53 inducible subunit , p53r2 , first reported by tanaka et al . they showed that p53r2 was not cell cycle regulated ( unlike r2 ) , but was significantly induced after exposure of normal fibroblasts to ir ( tanaka et al . , 2000 ) and was found to translocate to the nucleus , the proposed site of most important dntp production ( r2 did not ) . in cells that lacked wild - type ( wt ) p53 , there was no induction , indicating that functional p53 was necessary for p53r2 up - regulation . cells transfected with p53r2 were resistant to dna damage induced cell death . in agreement with other studies , they found no increase in r2 mrna , but did not measure protein levels . additional studies have subsequently shown that p53r2 forms an active complex with r1 ( guitett et al . , 2001 ) and rr activity increased in correlation with the increase in p53r2 , however the response of r2 was variable , with decrease in some lines and a moderate increase in the others ( yamaguchi et al . , 2001 ) . finally , other models are possible , including one described by xue and colleagues . in their study , both subunits were found to bind p53 in human oropharyngeal carcinoma cells , and in response to ir , were released to bind r1 in the nucleus ( xue et al . , 2003 ) , highlighting a third possibility in contrast to those previously presented . clearly , there is still work to be done in elucidating the response of rr to ir . many of the differences seen in the studies discussed can likely be attributed to the use of different techniques , materials , and especially cell lines . what should be clear is that rr is involved in the cellular response to ir and targeting it is both rational and likely desirable in enhancing the treatment of cancers with ir . it is likely that both r2 and p53r2 are involved to a different degree in different cancers , with cellular phenotype likely playing a key role in determining their relative significance . hydroxyurea ( hu ) is a hydroxylated analog of urea and was the first rr inhibitor to be extensively studied . it has directed activity at the tyrosine radical moiety of r2 and was first found to be active against cancer cells in 1963 ( stearns et al . , 1963 ) . subsequent experiments in vitro showed that in addition to its direct inhibition of dna synthesis , it was also a sensitizer of cell killing by x - rays , particularly if given before or after ir ( sinclair , 1968 ) . later experiments showed that this was also the case in in vivo animal tumor models using isotransplants of spontaneous c3h / he mouse mammary carcinomas ( piver et al . , 1972 ) . the total dose of ir to cure 50% of tumors was reduced when hu was combined with fractionated ir , although this effect was nt seen with single fraction ir treatments . given these encouraging pre - clinical results during the 19601970s , hu was subsequently examined in a number of clinical trials in a variety of human cancers . the majority of these trials have occurred in cervical cancer , most commonly in locally advanced disease . in particular , there were a number of prospective randomized controlled trials in the 1970s and 1980s that examined the effect of hu plus radiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone . and the gynecologic oncology group ( gog ) enrolled 190 women with figo stage iiib or iva cervical carcinoma . hu was administered orally at 80  mg / kg starting on the first day of irradiation and every 3  days thereafter for 12  weeks . patients received at least 50  gy minimum tumor dose to the whole pelvis followed by a single brachytherapy treatment of 20  gy to point a. in spite of the large number of patients enrolled , only 90 were eligible for assessment of response . this was due to ineligibility ( wrong stage , wrong cell type , etc . ) and those that were inevaluable ( refused treatment , periaortic node irradiation , improper field , etc . ) . the data were impressive , with a complete response ( cr ) of 68.1% in the hu group vs. 48.8% in the placebo ( p  =  <  0.05 ) , and a median progression free survival ( pfs ) of 13.6 vs. 7.6  months ( hreshchyshyn et al . , 1979 ) . however , myelosuppression was more common in the hu group , with seven grade iii or iv myelotoxicities . they recruited 148 women with figo iib or iiib cervical carcinoma and again compared hu to placebo in the setting of conventional radiotherapy , with hu given every 3  days for 12  weeks . of the stage iib patients , 74% receiving hu had no evidence of disease at the completion of therapy compared with 43.5% of the placebo ( p  =  <  0.01 ) . of the stage iiib patients , the cr rates were 52.5 vs. 33% ( p  =  0.22 ; piver et al . , 1977 ) . again , 78% of patients in the hu group developed leucopenia vs. 11% in the placebo group indicating a significant toxicity in addition to the improved clinical effect . at the time these studies were published , it was felt that hu added significant benefit to the treatment of locally advanced cervical carcinoma , and hu plus radiotherapy became the standard of care for the gog . however , over time , much of the data in these studies has been challenged , particularly in a systematic review by symonds et al . they found a number of methodological problems with the studies such as small sample size , large numbers of exclusions post randomization , subgroup analyses of already small groups and questionable censoring . they concluded that hu  appears to add to acute toxicity and probably increases late complications  and that  there is no convincing evidence of sufficient quality to suggest a therapeutic effect of this drug although the gog initially used hu as its standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer , it was nt long before this combination was supplanted by a new adjunct to radiation therapy . one of the most important studies prompting this paradigm shift was the gog 120 trial , first reported in 1999 ( rose et al . , 1999 ) and recently updated ( rose et al . , 2007 ) . gog 120 was a randomized phase iii study comparing cisplatin alone vs. cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hu vs. hu alone , in conjunction with pelvic irradiation for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer and pathologically negative para - aortic nodes . they reported a significant improvement in pfs and overall survival ( os ) in both cisplatin containing arms ( p  <  0.001 ) , with relative risks for progression of disease or death of 0.57 and 0.51 for cisplatin alone and cisplatin , fluorouracil and hu , respectively , when compared with hu alone . in addition , toxicities were similar in all groups . further , a similar study by whitney et al . compared the efficacy of standard radiotherapy ( rt ) plus hu with standard rt plus fluorouracil ( 5-fu ) and cisplatin in a randomized controlled trial . in 368 women with figo stage iib , iii , or iva cancer of the uterine cervix , there were significant improvements in pfs and os with the 5-fu and cisplatin combination ( whitney et al . , 1999 ) . adverse effects included leucopenia : 4% of 5-fu / cisplatin patients and 24% of hu patients experienced grade iii or iv toxicity . given the findings of these studies , concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy became the standard of care in locally advanced cervical cancer , spelling the end of hu use in the treatment of cervical cancer . in addition to its study in cervical carcinoma , hu has also been extensively investigated in other cancers , particularly head and neck . while early studies had significant flaws in methodology , a phase i study showed a 90% response rate in patients treated with hu , 5-fu , and palliative dose fractionated ir ( vokes et al . , 1989 ) , prompting a series of trials by the same group and others . this included work by mantz et al . , who examined the benefit of hu when added to a more extensive chemoradiation protocol including cisplatin , 5-fu , leucovorin , and interferon-2b induction chemotherapy followed by 5-fu and hu with fractionated radiotherapy in 32 laryngeal cancer patients . median follow up was 44.5  months , and , after completion of all therapy , the cr rate was 94% . median os was 44.5  months , and median pfs was 86 , 78 , and 78% at 1 , 3 , and 5  years , respectively , which compared favorably with other published data and for the first time saw patients with stage iv head and neck cancer failing distantly more often than locally ( mantz et al . the increased local control , unfortunately , was associated with increased toxicity , which has also been seen in other studies . one phase i study with prolonged infusion of hu with hyperfractionated , accelerated , external radiation in patients with advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck showed an increase in the severity of swallowing toxicity compared with previous trials , with severe edema , and reductions in motility and mobility of pharyngeal and laryngeal structures ( beitler et al . , 1998 ) . the same group later published a study examining the long term impact on swallowing that showed persistent , severe swallowing dysfunction ( smith et al . , 2000 ) . interestingly , these studies examined continuous hu infusions based on pre - clinical data that suggested that hu should always be given concurrently with ir to maximize effect . even though local control was excellent , with just 4 of 26 patients experiencing recurrence , quality of life is of great importance in these patients , and the late follow up reported esophageal strictures for the first time after chemoradiotherapy , suggesting that this particular regimen may be too aggressive . the state of hu in head and neck cancer is well reviewed by argiris et al . ( 2003 ) and while the authors are optimistic about the future of chemoradiation in head and neck cancer , it remains to be seen where hu and other rr inhibitors will fit in the future treatment of this disease site . even as hu has slowly progressed in the clinic , work has continued on examining the mechanism by which it sensitizes cells to the effects of ir . in particular , work by kuo et al . has shown that the sequence with which cells are treated with hu plays an important role . they demonstrated that in the caski cervical cancer cell line , clinically relevant concentrations of hu had a significant interaction with ir , with post - ir exposure  >  pre - ir ( kuo et al . , 1997 ) . this was associated with increased g2 delay , suggesting a decrease in the repair of damaged dna . in addition , in cells overexpressing the r2 subunit , hu is able to return ir sensitivity to baseline ( kuo et al . , 2003 ) , demonstrating that r2 inhibition is the likely mechanism for hu radiosensitization in these cells . these findings are potentially informative about the failure of hu to become established as a radiosensitizer in cervical cancer . in the majority of the early trials , given that hu works best in vitro when dosed immediately after ir exposure , one could conclude that these trials were not optimized for best effect . in addition , hu has recently been shown to have a significant effect on the mechanism of dna dsb repair employed by cells after exposure to ir . burkhalter et al . showed that cells pre - incubated with hu were unable to use homologous recombination ( hr ) to repair dsb , and instead relied on non - homologous end joining ( nhej ) . in addition , cells that were nhej deficient had significantly more dsb after hu treatment ( burkhalter et al . , 2009 ) . given that nhej is thought to be the dominant dsb repair mechanism in cells treated with hu , rr inhibitors are likely to have enhanced activity in tumors that are nhej deficient . even with new studies on its mechanism of action , hu will likely remain consigned to history due to the many inadequacies it has as a drug molecule . while its oral absorption is almost complete and it is completely distributed in the water compartments of the body , hu has a short half - life ( between 1.6 and 4.45  h ; gwilt and tracewell , 1998 ) and its effectiveness is limited by relatively low affinity for rr and by the development of resistance . one area where it could potentially find use in the future is in cns neoplasms , as it does cross the blood recent studies have examined its use in progressive meningioma in combination with 3d - conformal radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy . in one trial , pfs at 1 and 2  years was 84 and 77% , which is similar to other adjuvant studies ( hahn et al . in spite of the mixed clinical data for hu , there is sufficient proof of concept to suggest that a rr inhibitor can be efficacious as a radiosensitizer in human cancers . thus , there has been a concerted effort to discover more potent molecules with more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for this purpose . one of the more promising of these is triapine , a thiosemicarbazone that destroys the tyrosyl radical in r2/p53r2 by forming a redox active complex with iron , producing reactive oxygen species . in studies comparing it with hu in vitro , triapine was shown to have significantly higher potency in both enzyme and cell assays . in addition , it was fully active against hu and gemcitabine resistant cells and was equally potent against r2 and p53r2 , whereas hu was approximately threefold less potent at binding p53r2 ( zhu et al . , 2009 ) . in addition , in in vivo models , triapine was active against hu resistant l1210 and kb cell lines and caused significant inhibition of solid tumor growth in mouse xenograft models ( finch et al . further studies have examined the radiosensitizing properties of triapine in a number of human cell lines . used a panel of three human tumor cell lines , including glioma , pancreatic , and prostate cancer cells , with triapine enhancing radiosensitivity when delivered 16  h before or immediately after ir by 1.5- to 2-fold . ir interaction was associated with a reduction in the repair of dna dsb as evidenced by a persistence of h2ax foci at 24  h ( barker et al . , 2006 ) . a similar effect was seen in mouse tumor xenografts , again , with greater effect if triapine was dosed just after ir . the most effective temporal relationship between triapine dosing and ir is similar to that seen with hu in earlier pre - clinical studies . interestingly , normal human fibroblasts were only sensitized when triapine was given before , not after ir , suggesting a potential for an improved therapeutic index for ir  triapine sequencing that may be incorporated into future clinical studies . are ic50 ( concentration of compounds producing 50% inhibition of recombinant rr activity ) values for both compounds in an in vitro rr activity assay with r2 or p53r2 bound to r1 ( zhu et al . , 2009 ) . also shown are elimination half - lives ( t1/2 ) for both compounds ( gwilt and tracewell , 1998 ; kunos et al . , 2010b ) . of note , many cancers have virally or mutationally silenced p53 that allows rr activity to continue unchecked . in these cancers , it is potentially of increased importance to inhibit the r2 and p53r2 subunits that have lost p53 regulatory control . this is the case in cervical cancer , where the vast majority have dysfunctional p53 due to hpv infection . in one study , three cervical cancer cell lines with mutated or dysfunctional p53 were irradiated 6  h after triapine exposure . in all cases , the cell lines were sensitized to ir and sustained dna damage as measured by persistence of h2ax foci . in addition , by measuring dctp levels , the investigators were able to show reduced rr activity in cells with and without functional p53 , demonstrating that the inhibition of rr is p53 independent ( kunos et al . , 2009 ) . these findings were reinforced by further work of the same group that also showed a synergistic effect when cisplatin was added in addition to triapine and ir ( kunos et al . , 2010a ) . these promising pre - clinical data have prompted the initiation of a number of clinical trials . indeed , triapine has so far been studied in 27 clinical trials in the usa at various stages of recruitment ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) , including those in both solid and hematologic malignancies . in particular there are three trials investigating the radiosensitizing potential of triapine , with data from one phase i study being published by kunos et al . the purpose of their study was to assess the safety / tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and clinical activity of triapine three times weekly in concert with once weekly cisplatin and pelvic radiation in 11 patients with gynecologic malignancies . triapine was dosed in 2  h infusions and the half - life was found to be 2  h. all 10 patients with advanced stage ib to ivb cervical cancer achieved complete clinical response , with a median 18  month follow up showing no disease progression in any of the patients . five of the 10 patients had pet / ct evident pelvic or para - aortic lymphadenopathy before treatment , with complete resolution on follow up imaging after treatment ( kunos et al . in addition to the clinical data , the authors also examined objective markers of disease response . late responders had a significantly higher rr activity on day 10 vs. day 1 and there was no temporal change in rr activity in the early responders , indicating that the expected spike in rr activity after ir was suppressed by triapine . the fact that the late responders experienced durable responses in spite of elevated rr activity at day 10 suggests that there may be other mechanisms of triapine activity that require further study . the promising results from this phase i trial prompted a phase ii trial which is now underway . over the last 10  years , there have been a number of major leaps forward in the field of radiation oncology that allow us to deliver higher doses of radiation in ever more specific ways to our patients . still , in the vast majority of cases , we are constrained by dose limiting toxicities that must be accounted for when designing treatment plans and balanced against the therapeutic benefit realized . therefore , the field of radio modulation and specifically radiosensitization will continue to grow in importance in the coming years as we search for ways to maximize the therapeutic index of our treatments . while there are many different radiosensitizers currently being studied , the rr inhibitors are among the oldest of targets , and are getting a new lease of life in recent times with the development of more modern drug molecules . as outlined in the review above , the story began with the study of hu in combination with ir in a number of pre - clinical trials in the 1960s , leading to a large amount of interest in the clinic , culminating with the gog adopting hu and ir as its standard of care in locally advanced cervical cancer . while its success in this arena was short lived , many parallel studies investigating the mechanism of action of hu were carried out , resulting in a far clearer understanding of the biological interactions between ir and rr inhibitors . even as hu was fading from view , investigators were working on successors including the intriguing molecule , triapine . as shown above , this drug works in a similar fashion to hu , but has significantly improved potency , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics . the phase i study in cervical cancers that was recently published includes some very encouraging data , and the field waits in anticipation for the publication of further trials . it remains to be seen what the best dosing regimen for triapine will be , however the weight of pre - clinical data , including that with hu , suggests that daily dosing shortly after radiation therapy will be most effective and provide the greatest therapeutic window . these authors would encourage studies incorporating this type of dosing schedule in the clinic , although this must obviously be weighed carefully against the potential for increased toxicity . in addition to triapine , there are other new rr inhibitors being tested at various stages , including trimidox and motexafin gadolinium . ( 1994 ) , in a paper that reported 100-fold more potency at rr than hu in a cell based assay . subsequent in vitro studies have demonstrated that while it acts as a radiosensitizer in panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells ( ahmed and hassan , 2000 ) , it is less potent than hu and further work is ongoing to fully assess its potential . motexafin gadolinium is a texaphyrin molecule that targets thioredoxin reductase in addition to rr . in in vitro experiments , it was shown to inhibit rr with an ic50 of 26  m ( hashemy et al . , 2006 ) , although given that it has a number of other cellular effects , it is unclear how much of its potency as a radiosensitizer is due to rr inhibition alone . it is likely that the coming years will continue to see the emergence of new rr inhibitors with unique properties . the recent advances in the understanding of rr biology and the development of new inhibitors places us at an important crossroads in the story of rr inhibitors . there are sufficient data to provide proof of concept for the target from a biological standpoint , however clinical trials to this point have not been wholly convincing . it will be interesting to follow the development of the field in the next 510  years , particularly with the clinical trials of triapine in cervical cancer , and hopefully at least one of the many rr inhibitors being studied will eventually bring additional therapeutic benefit to patients in the near future . the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .","ribonucleotide reductase ( rr ) , the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis and repair of dna , has been studied as a target for inhibition in the treatment of cancer for many years . 
 while some researchers have focused on rr inhibitors as chemotherapeutic agents , particularly in hematologic malignancies , some of the most promising data has been generated in the field of radiosensitization . 
 early pre - clinical studies demonstrated that the addition of the first of these drugs , hydroxyurea , to ionizing radiation ( ir ) produced a synergistic effect in vitro , leading to a large number of clinical studies in the 19701980s . 
 these studies , mainly in cervical cancer , initially produced a great deal of interest , leading to the incorporation of hydroxyurea in the treatment protocols of many institutions . 
 however , over time , the conclusions from these studies have been called into question and hydroxyurea has been replaced in the standard of care of cervical cancer . over the last 10  years 
 , a number of well - done pre - clinical studies have greatly advanced our understanding of rr as a target . 
 those advances include the elucidation of the role of p53r2 and our understanding of the temporal relationship between the delivery of ir and the response of rr . at the same time 
 , new inhibitors with increased potency and improved binding characteristics have been discovered , and pre - clinical and early clinical data look promising . here 
 we present a comprehensive review of the pre - clinical and clinical data in the field to date and provide some discussion of future areas of research .",321
"the search for new therapeutic approaches capable of preventing and treating 
 musculoskeletal dysfunctions is progressively increasing in conjunction with current 
 technological innovations . in this context , taping techniques have developed as a complement 
 to the treatment of musculoskeletal dysfunctions , and has improved over time to provide 
 therapeutic effects which do not hinder the functionality of a particular body segment . in 1973 , dr . kenzo kase developed an elastic tape with elastic properties similar to the 
 skin , and named it kinesio tape1,2,3,4 . the kinesio taping method originated from the hypothesis that an 
 external component could aid the functions of muscles and other tissues5 , 6 . it is thin and 
 elastic by design , and can stretch to 40% to 60% of its original length , which makes it very 
 elastic compared to traditional taping materials , allowing complete range of motion5,6,7 . various authors have described the benefits of kinesio taping as being dependent on the 
 stretch of the tape and the form of placement on the skin , which elicits : positional 
 stimulus and correction of muscle function ; improvement of fascial tissue alignment ; 
 facilitation of bodily fluid circulation ; repair of injured tissues ; sensory stimulation 
 assisting or limiting movement , thereby improving proprioception ; edema control by guiding 
 lymph toward lymph nodes ; and correction of joint position2 , 5,6,7,8,9,10,11 . according to kenzo kase , the stretch applied to the tape creates tension in the skin which 
 improves communication with mechanoreceptors and increases the number of motor units 
 recruited during a muscle contraction5 . 
 through these effects , the tape can improve muscle function by facilitating the contraction 
 of inactive muscles . therefore , the application of kinesio taping over the gripping musculature of the hand 
 could possibly be used to complement therapeutic treatment of manual dysfunction once its 
 influence has been assessed on healthy individuals . the human hand is clearly the most 
 important and complex structure of the upper extremity due to its extensive mobility and the 
 sensitive capabilities of its surrounding tissues , which allows gripping and feeling , its 
 essential functions2 , 12 due to the increasing utilization of kinesio tape in clinical settings , studies are 
 necessary to confirm the purported benefits of the method and establish evidence - based 
 standards for this technique . in light of the scarcity of research regarding kinesio taping , 
 and the fundamental role of handgrip strength in activities of daily living , this study 
 assessed the effects of kinesio taping on the handgrip strength of healthy women , as 
 measured by handgrip dynamometry . this study recruited 75 healthy women volunteers , aged between 18 and 30  years , who were 
 randomly subdivided into three groups ( n=25 ) : kinesio , kinesio without tension ( kwt ) , and 
 the control groups . the kinesio group received tape application at 25% to 35% of tension ; 
 the kwt group received tape application with no longitudinal stretch ; while the control 
 group did not receive any taping techniques . subjects from both the kinesio and kwt groups 
 were unaware of the tension utilized on their respective taping techniques to avoid possible 
 influences on the results . the subjects of this study were physical therapy students of the university salgado de 
 oliveira in brazil , who were invited to participate as volunteers through advertisements 
 placed inside their classrooms . the inclusion criteria required a signed informed consent 
 form and agreement to participate during all phases of the study . the exclusion criteria were : outside of the established age range ; absence from the 24-hour 
 or 48-hour follow - up assessment of handgrip strength ; presence of limiting factors which 
 could have influenced the results , such as cardiopulmonary , hormonal , or osteomyoarticular 
 disorders ; joint or bone deformities , congenital or acquired , in either of the upper 
 extremities ; central or peripheral neurological deficits ; use of anabolic substances ; injury 
 or surgery to the upper extremities within the last six months ; or consumption of alcoholic 
 beverages or pharmaceutical substances 24 hours prior to the start of this study . this research was approved by the research ethics committee of the hospital of tropical 
 diseases under protocol number 009/2011 . the instrument utilized to measure handgrip strength was a jamar dynamometer , 
 which has been validated as a gold standard tool for this purpose by the american society of 
 hand therapists ( asht)11 . this instrument 
 allows simple and quick readings of handgrip strength , which is measured in kilograms / force . initially , the subjects sat on an adjustable chair which was adjusted so that subjects 
 backs were straight , with their knees and hips in 90 of flexion with their feet on the 
 floor . the shoulders were positioned in adduction next to the trunk with the elbows in 90 
 of flexion , the forearm and wrist in the neutral position , and the arm unsupported , while 
 the examiner held the dynamometer for each reading , as recommended by the asht14 . the subjects performed the handgrip movement with maximum effort , only during exhalation 
 and after a verbal cue given by the examiner : three measurements were 
 made for each hand , alternating the test sides , starting with the right hand a rest interval 
 of 60 seconds was provided between trials in order to avoid muscle fatigue during the 
 assessment . subjects were instructed to maintain maximum contraction for 5 seconds in each 
 trial , since research has demonstrate that peak force is reached between 3 to 10 seconds of 
 contraction13 . subjects from the kinesio and kwt groups had the skin of their forearms cleaned with a 
 cotton pad and 70% alcohol before the application of the respective kinesio taping 
 techniques . a single researcher certified in the kinesio taping method conducted the taping , 
 and pink kinesio tex gold tape was used . the technique performed for the kinesio group aims to influence muscle function by 
 activating the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles . the tape was initially anchored with 
 2.5 to 5  cm of tape at the medial epicondyle , then 25% to 35% of tension was applied as it 
 was wound over the target muscle toward the hand . the kwt group received the same tape 
 application , but no tension was added as the tape was applied ( 0% of stretch ) . the control 
 group only performed the handgrip strength assessment and did not receive any taping . the handgrip strength dynamometry was reassessed for all groups after 30 minutes , 24 hours , 
 and 48 hours of taping . the subjects did not exercise their gripping muscles during the 48 
 hours of this study . the variables were 
 normally distributed , and the statistical package for the social science software ( version 
 15.0 ) was used . initially , a descriptive analysis of the data was conducted in order to 
 obtain the mean , standard deviations , minimums , and maximums of the mesured items . the anova 
 test ( complemented by the student s t - test ) was used to verify and compare the effects of 
 kinesio taping on handgrip strength after 30 minutes , 24 hours , and 48 hours . the initial sample size totaled 83 subjects , with an average age of 21.5  years ( sd  2.60 ) . eight subjects did 
 not participate in the study s entirety ( did not return after 24 or 48 hours for 
 reassessment of handgrip strength , or presented limiting factors which could have interfered 
 with the results ) , and were excluded following the exclusion criteria , reducing the sample 
 size to 75 healthy women . regarding the behavior of handgrip strength values , it was observed that only the kinesio 
 group presented an increase in the average values of each at the assessment times ( table 1table 1.average strength of the right and left hands of the different groups 
 ( kg / f)time of assessmentkinesio groupaverage ( sd)control groupaverage ( sd)kinesio with notension average ( sd)right handpre - taping ( baseline)24.6 ( 3.5)25.0 ( 3.3)25.4 ( 2.9)30 minutes later26.5 ( 3.6)*24.4 ( 3.3)25.2 ( 2.9)24 hours later27.1 ( 3.5)*24.8 ( 3.1)25.2 ( 2.7)48 hours later26.9 ( 3.5)*24.3 ( 3.0)25.6 ( 3.2)left handpre - taping ( baseline)23.3 ( 3.8)24.3 ( 3.5)25.1 ( 2.6)30 minutes later25.9 ( 4.4)*24.0 ( 3.2)24.6 ( 2.9)24 hours later26.2 ( 3.9)*24.0 ( 2.9)24.8 ( 2.9)48 hours later26.2 ( 3.7)*23.8 ( 3.3)25.2 ( 2.9 ) * statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) ) . * statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) it was also observed that a significant increase in strength values occurred in the right 
 hand , compared to the initial values , after 24 hours and 48 hours of taping . for the left 
 hand , an increase in strength was observed , compared to pre - taping , after 30 minutes 24 
 hours , and 48 hours of taping ( p<0.05 ) . the analysis of the data regarding the duration of taping and the different handgrip 
 assessment times among the groups revealed there were no significant findings between the 
 control and kwt groups . the right hand of the group that received kinesio taping showed 
 significant differences in strength from the control group of taping , and the left hand 
 showed a significant difference after 48 hours of taping . in comparison of the kinesio and 
 kwt groups only the right hand showed a significant difference after 24 hours of taping 
 ( p<0.05 ) . in the comparison of handgrip strength between the dominant and non - dominant hands , it was 
 observed that the dominant hand demonstrated greater handgrip strength at all the assessment 
 times , when considering the average dynamometry value , especially in the kinesio and control 
 groups ( table 1 ) . research regarding kinesio taping is still scarce in the scientific literature since the 
 technique has only received international attention within the last ten years . moreover , the 
 available studies did not have large , homogeneous samples and were conducted with 
 questionable methodologies . it should be noted that the present study is the first to 
 utilize a large sample size in order assess the effects of kinesio taping on muscle 
 strength . the primary objective of this study was to observe the influence of kinesio taping on 
 handgrip strength by comparing the average handgrip strength as measured by dynamometry 
 prior to tape application with its respective values after 30 minutes , 24 hours , and 48 
 hours of taping . the results demonstrate statistically significant differences after 24 
 hours and 48 hours of taping for the right hand , and at the three post - taping assessmentimes 
 for the left hand . the results for the right hand after 30 minutes of taping revealed a 
 p - value of 0.0575 , which although the results was not significant , was very close to the 
 level of significance adopted by this study . similar findings were not observed in the kwt 
 and control groups , thus confirming the hypothesis of this study , that kinesio taping can 
 increase handgrip strength when applied with systematic standards for that purpose . according to kenzo kase , the kinesio taping method can improve the strength of muscles 
 weakened by correcting muscle function with stimuli and reinforcement . our present results 
 are similar to those reported by vithoulka et al.15 in which kinesio taping increased eccentric muscle strength in 
 healthy adults . in contrast to our present results , chang et al.16 evaluated the influence of kinesio taping on the maximum handgrip 
 strength of 21 healthy students , all of them men and athletes . the technique employed was 
 specifically for medial epicondylitis , and no significant changes in strength were observed 
 after taping . however , a confounding factor in this study was that the tension applied to 
 the placebo group , which was the same as that of the kinesio group ( between 15% and 20% ) . also , with the start of taping being more distal than the insertion point , the tension zone 
 was the same , thus making the purpose of comparison between these two groups 
 questionable . another study investigated the immediate and delayed effects of two directions of kinesio 
 taping on maximal isometric strength of the wrist and finger muscles of healthy adults . inhibition and 
 facilitation kt techniques were separately used to tape the dominant and non - dominant 
 forearms of the participants , respectively . maximal isometric strength of wrist extension , 
 middle finger extension , and the grip of both hands were measured before taping , immediately 
 after taping , and after 24  h of taping ( with the tape in situ ) . compared with the baseline , 
 the average maximal isometric strength of middle finger extensors increased considerably 
 after application of the facilitation kinesio tape . no significant time effect was observed 
 on the middle finger extension strength on the dominant side or on the wrist extension and 
 grip strength on either side . divergences are also seen in the results presented by fu et al.16 , in which kinesio taping was applied with 120% of 
 longitudinal stretch over the quadriceps and hamstring muscles of 14 healthy athletes ( 7 men 
 and 7 women ) , and assessed in the following manner : before tape application , immediately 
 after taping , and 12 hours afterward . an isokinetic dynamometer was utilized in order to 
 verify the muscle strength , and no significant increase was found in the muscle strength of 
 these athletes . an issue with the 
 method of this study is that the actual tension applied to the tape was 120% , which should 
 only be utilized for taping procedures of a ligamentous injury . such a high tension may 
 hinder muscle contraction and decrease joint mobility , which could also lead to 
 non - functional movement and muscle inactivation . some authors have reported increases in electromyographic activity induced by the use of 
 kinesio tape : e.g. slupik et al.18 , chen 
 et al.19 , hsu et al.8 , and thelen , dauben and stoneman6 . in all of these studies , , there are consistency issues with the assessments of 
 kinesio taping , as witnessed by the lack of a systematic approach in data collection , which 
 did not permit a reliable assessment of initial benefits , the duration of benefits or the 
 residual effects after kt removal . some authors have evaluated the influence of kinesio 
 taping immediately after its application8 , 16 , other have assessed it immediately 
 afterward and 12 hours later17 , as well 
 as 24 hours and 72 hours later18 , and 
 only after 72 hours of taping15 . with regards to the stretch applied to the tape , some authors do not specify how much was 
 utilized in their studies8 , 19 . other studies simply do not follow the standards 
 recommended by the kinesio taping association . an example of this is related to the tension 
 for muscle activation , which has been established to be between 25% and 35% . nevertheless , 
 some authors have opted to utilize 15% to 20% of tension16 and even 120%15 . also a simple tape just placed without tension as performed for the control group in this 
 study with no specific direction , will elicit tape stimulus and some effects should be 
 apparent . kinesio tape applied to the skin without tension will exert minimal tensions 
 during body and skin movements . no tension is also used in the kinesio taping method for 
 patients that are high sensitive to external stimulous . so it ca nt be called placebo , it is 
 just a different degree of stimulus . when comparing the kinesio and control groups of the present study , the greatest handgrip 
 strength values were observed in the kinesio group at 24 hours and 48 hours after 
 application of the taping technique to the right hand , and after 48 hours for the left hand . these results indicate that handgrip strength increased and remained elevated in the right 
 hand for 48 hours . for the left hand , considering that changes in handgrip strength were observed after 24 hours in the right 
 hand , which lasted up to 48 hours , and that such changes were noted only after 48 hours of 
 taping in the left hand , we believe that the sensitivity of the right hand is greater than 
 that of the left hand . therefore , the mechanoreceptor stimulus induced by the kinesio taping 
 provided a faster response in the right hand than in its counterpart . the left hand possibly 
 required greater tension and a longer period of time for it to receive sufficient 
 stimulation to achieve the same results as for the right hand . with regards to the augmented handgrip strength observed for the right hand of the kinesio 
 group in relation to the kwt group after 24 hours of taping , we assume that the tactile 
 stimulus to the dermis and epidermis are present even when kt is applied without tension , 
 since the skin maintains it normal mobility by stretching and recoiling in relation to the 
 tape during upper extremity movements . another result noted was that the dominant hand presented greater handgrip strength when 
 considering the average values at each of the four assessment times , namely , before kinesio 
 taping application , and 30 minutes , 24 hours , and 48 hours later . this finding was observed 
 for all the groups , but with a higher percentage in the kinesio and control groups . considering the present results , it is possible to conclude that an increase in handgrip 
 strength occurred over pre - taping values at 30 minutes , 24 hours , and 48 hours after kinesio 
 taping application . a statistically significant increase was observed in the kinesio group , 
 when compared to control group after 24 and 48 hours of taping for the right hand , and after 
 48 hours of taping for the left hand . between the kinesio and kwt groups , the dominant hand presented greater handgrip 
 strength values in all assessments of all the groups .","[ purpose ] the purpose of this research was to evaluate the change in muscle function 
 induced by a kinesio tape application with no or moderate tension , to the dominant and 
 non - dominant arms . 
 [ subjects and methods ] this research was a quantitative study , in which 
 75 women participated . 
 the subjects , aged 1830 years , were divided into 3 groups , 
 kinesio , kinesio without tension , and control , and they were assessed before the taping 
 intervention and after 30 minutes , 24 hours , and 48 hours of taping . [ results ] the kinesio 
 group subjects demonstrated an increase in handgrip strength after 30 minutes , 24 hours , 
 and 48 hours of tape application compared to control . a statistically significant increase 
 in strength 
 was observed in the kinesio group comparison to the control after 24 hours and 
 48 hours for the right hand , and after 48 hours for the left hand . 
 improvement in the 
 kinesio group compared to the kinesio without tension was observed only after 24 hours of 
 taping application , and only in the right hand . 
 [ conclusion ] the kinesio taping method 
 augmented the handgrip strength of healthy women , and the increase in grip strength was 
 maintained for 48 hours after its application ; the dominant hand demonstrated the greatest 
 strength values .",282
"s. aureus is commonly present in diabetic foot infections [ 14 ] , particularly limb - threatening infections [ 57 ] , as well as more invasive infections like endocarditis . additionally , hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of death from s. aureus bacteremia . thus , diabetes and hyperglycemia appear to increase the risk and severity of infection by s. aureus by inhibiting normal host defenses . currently , these mechanisms are only partially understood . to date , immunological insufficiency related to hyperglycemia has primarily focused on inhibition of neutrophil responses [ 1012 ] . we have recently shown in vitro that hyperglycemic conditions ( > 6  mm glucose ) inhibit complement effectors against s. aureus including opsonization and anaphylatoxin generation . hyperglycemic inhibition of complement - mediated opsonization resulted in decreased phagocytosis efficiency by euglycemic neutrophils , such that neutrophil function was not directly inhibited by excess glucose . previous investigators had shown that the central component of complement , c3 , could be slowly glycated ( i.e. , 20% glycation over 24 hours ) . however , our data demonstrated the effects of elevated glucose on complement activation on the surface of s. aureus occurring in minutes . by mass spectrometry we showed that hyperglycemic conditions produced no changes in glycation over one hour , but hyperglycemic conditions did produce changes in the tertiary structure of c3 , likely altering its function . these in vitro results suggested that the complement system , a major contributor to innate immune host defenses against s. aureus [ 1416 ] , was significantly inhibited by hyperglycemic conditions in responding to s. aureus . our results were consistent with prior reporting that diabetic patients have a decreased ability to fix complement by igg . in order to measure the extent to which a hyperglycemic environment altered complement - mediated immune effectors against s. aureus infection in vivo a peritonitis model was chosen as a pertinent clinical model , as well as an excellent model for evaluating complement - mediated effectors [ 15 , 18 , 19 ] by analyzing recovered peritoneal lavage fluid . previous investigators have evaluated s. aureus foot - pad infection in a nod diabetic mouse model , but the mice were c5-deficient limiting the ability to evaluate complement - mediated effects . streptozocin ( sigma aldrich ) was dissolved in saline at 0.5  mg / ml . nph insulin ( eli lily ) was 10  u / ml . s. aureus strain reynolds was grown in columbia 2% nacl broth overnight at 37c to stationary phase . rats were provided acetaminophen in their drinking water ( 1.6  mg / ml ) for analgesia . rats were monitored for weight , appearance , and behavior , but no animals demonstrated moderate or severe distress during the experiments . pilot studies were performed with 65  mg / kg streptozocin i.p . , which induced stable hyperglycemia after 12 hours and was reversible with 2 units of nph insulin s.c . dosing pilot studies were performed with streptozocin - treated rats using 10 , 10 , or 10  cfu of s. aureus i.p . , evaluated by peritoneal wash at 6 hours . the timing of immune - pathogen interactions in streptozocin - treated animals ( 10  cfu s. aureus i.p . ) demonstrated optimal evaluation of early events at 2 hours and late events at 24 hours after infection . four rats were untreated and underwent peritoneal wash to measure baseline ( 0 hour ) parameters . ten ( 10 ) rats received sham streptozocin ( stz ) injections and 30 rats received stz 65  mg / ml i.p . stable hyperglycemia was achieved ( figure 1(b ) ) for all but one stz - treated rat , which was excluded from subsequent analyses . thirty - nine ( 39 ) rats were inoculated with 10  cfu s. aureus i.p . this amount of s. aureus is consistent with established s. aureus infections . at 2 hours after infection , 19 rats were euthanized and had peritoneal lavage . two ( 2 ) peritoneal wash samples demonstrated particulate matter suggestive of fecal matter and were excluded from subsequent analyses . at 2 hours after infection 10 of the remaining rats were injected with insulin ( 2  u nph s.c . ) , which was repeated ( 2  u nph s.c . ) at 8 hours after infection . at 24 hours after infection pellets were resuspended to their original volume in cold pbs and divided for subsequent analyses . cytospins ( 100  l ) were performed to generate multiple slides for each sample . other aliquots of resuspended pellets were washed with water to lyse neutrophils and then serially diluted for colony count assays or stripped of opsonic c3-fragments and c4-fragments . wright stains ( diff - quik ) were performed and 5 random high powered fields were counted for each slide by a blinded observer and averaged . phagocytosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy after acridine orange staining of bacteria followed by crystal violet quenching of extracellular bacteria , as previously described . one hundred neutrophils were observed in random high powered fields by a blinded observer and evaluated for the percentage of neutrophils phagocytizing bacteria and the total number of bacteria phagocytized . bacterial suspensions were generated from peritoneal wash samples pelleted and resuspended to their original volume in water to lyse neutrophils . the suspensions were then serially diluted and multiple dilutions were plated for colony counting , as previously described . s. aureus recovered from the peritoneal washes were divided for analysis by flow cytometry , elisa , or western blot . s. aureus for flow cytometry analysis were incubated with fitc - labeled anti - c3 antibody ( mp biomedicals ) . negative controls included ( 1 ) unstained peritoneal bacteria and ( 2 ) uninjected bacteria incubated with anti - c3 antibody ; both yielded minimal fluorescence values below the threshold for detection used for data collection . fluorescence intensities were measured on a fluorescence activated cell sorter facscalibur ( bd biosciences ) for 10,000 events . flowjo software ( tree star ) was used to measure the area under the curve ( auc ) for c3-fragments bound to the bacterial surface . bound c3-fragments and c4-fragments were stripped from s. aureus using methylamine , the most commonly used and accepted methodology , as previously described . the rat c3 elisa was performed using a rabbit anti - rat c3 antibody for capture ( bethy lab ) and probed with mouse anti - rat c3 antibody ( hycult ) followed by goat anti - mouse hrp antibody ( sigma ) . western blot analysis was performed using rabbit anti - rat c3 followed by a goat anti - rabbit hrp antibody . quantitation was calculated from standard curves using purified c3 and c4 proteins ( comptech ) . total igg concentration in peritoneal wash samples was measured by sds - page and coomassie staining to minimize backgrounds found with elisa assay . peritoneal wash samples and a titration of purified igg ( gammagard , baxter ) were assayed by sds - page with coomassie brilliant ( biorad ) staining . images were captured digitally and optical densitometry measurements were performed with quantity one ( biorad ) . peritoneal wash samples were measured for total c4 and total c3 by elisa and assayed by c3 western blot , as described above . c3a concentration in peritoneal wash samples was measured by quantitative western blot to minimize backgrounds found with elisa . samples were blotted along with a titration of pure c3a ( comptech ) to generate a standard curve . a rabbit anti - human c3a antibody ( comptech ) was followed by a goat anti - rabbit hrp antibody ( sigma ) . c5a concentration was measured by elisa ( r&d systems ) as per the manufacturer 's instructions . free dna in the peritoneal wash supernatants was assayed using quant - it picogreen ( molecular probes ) . briefly , 1.0  ml of peritoneal wash was combined with 1.0  ml of quant - it picogreen reagent and fluorescence ( excitation 480  nm , emission 520  nm ) was measured on a spectrofluorometer ( perkin elmer ) . myeloperoxidase activity was measured using tmb substrate solution   ( thermo scientific ) . in a 96-well plate , 10  l of peritoneal wash sample was combined with 100  l of tmb . the plates were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30  min and then absorbance values were read at 450  nm . all data are shown as mean  standard error of the mean . comparisons between two groups were made by student 's t - test with p values  0.05 considered statistically significant . in order to evaluate hyperglycemic effects on s. aureus - induced influx of humoral immune components critical in the control of s. aureus infection , we assayed igg , c3 , and c4 in the peritoneal lavage fluid . igg was measured by total protein stained sds - page ( figure 2(a ) ) , due to high background signal for elisa . euglycemic rats showed a 2.5-fold increase in igg compared with diabetic rats at 2 hours after infection ( p = 0.03 ) . at 24 hours after infection , insulin - rescued rats showed a 2-fold increase in igg compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.001 ) . these results suggest that hyperglycemia inhibits the influx of igg to the site of s. aureus infection and that insulin treatment of hyperglycemia reverses this effect . complement c4 , a critical component of classical and lectin complement pathway activation , was assayed by elisa ( figure 2(b ) ) . at 2 hours after infection , a trend towards increased c4 influx was noted for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.08 ) . at 24 hours after infection , insulin - rescued rats demonstrated a 2-fold increase in c4 concentration compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.02 ) . c3 influx into the peritoneum was assayed by elisa ( figure 2(c ) ) . at 2 hours after infection , c3 values were not significantly different , but at 24 hours after infection , insulin - rescued rats demonstrated a 1.7-fold increase compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.01 ) . in order to confirm c3 elisa results and evaluate the c3 forms present in the peritoneal fluid , we performed western blot analyses of the peritoneal fluid . at 2 hours after infection , western blot analysis suggested increased c3-forms for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats and showed that this was predominantly unactivated c3 with some ic3b ( figure 2(d ) ) . several of these samples were analyzed by western blot along with purified c3 , c3b , and ic3b confirming the identity of c3b and ic3b ( data not shown ) . at 24 hours after infection , western blot analysis showed increased c3-forms for insulin - rescued rats compared with diabetic rats ( figure 2(e ) ) . , these results suggest that hyperglycemia inhibits the influx of critical complement components to the site of s. aureus infection , but insulin rescue can improve the influx of complement components compared with persistent hyperglycemia . in order to further evaluate hyperglycemic effects on s. aureus - initiated complement activation as well as anaphylatoxin generation , we measured c3a and c5a concentrations in the peritoneal lavage samples . complement anaphylatoxins are direct indicators of complement activation and play vital roles in neutrophil chemotaxis and neutrophil activation , as well as increasing vascular permeability [ 28 , 29 ] . c3a concentrations were measured using a quantitative western blot ( figure 3(a ) ) , due to high background levels with elisa . peritoneal c3a levels increased over baseline measurements by 2 hours after infection , at which time c3a concentration in euglycemic rats was 2.5-fold greater than diabetic rats ( p = 0.03 ) . at 24 hours after infection , c3a concentrations increased to 2-fold which is greater for insulin - rescued rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.01 ) . at 2 hours after infection c5a levels were not significantly different between the groups ( figure 3(b ) ) , but at 24 hours after infection , c5a concentrations increased to 2-fold greater for insulin - rescued rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.02 ) . together , these results show that hyperglycemia was associated with less anaphylatoxin generation in the rat peritoneum in response to s. aureus infection . the 24-hour data suggest that insulin rescue and reversal of hyperglycemia significantly increased complement activation and anaphylatoxin generation in response to s. aureus infection . in order to evaluate the effects of hyperglycemia on complement opsonization of s. aureus in the peritoneum , we recovered the bacteria from the peritoneal wash samples and assayed them by flow cytometry or stripped the bound complement opsonins and assayed them by elisa and western blot . complement - mediated opsonization with c3b and ic3b is critical for efficient phagocytosis of s. aureus and survival of bacteremia [ 22 , 23 , 30 ] . opsonization of s. aureus with c4 forms was measured by elisa and normalized for numbers of bacteria present ( figure 4(a ) ) . c4-fragment opsonization of s. aureus was increased by 4-fold at 2 hours for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.02 ) . c4-opsonization was increased 15-fold for insulin - rescued rats at 24 hours after infection compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.05 ) . these results suggest that classical or lectin complement pathway activation on the s. aureus surface was greatly decreased in hyperglycemic conditions . flow cytometry analysis of efficiency of c3-opsonization of s. aureus recovered in the peritoneal wash samples was measured for area under the curve and normalized for 10,000 counts . at 2 hours after infection a 2-fold increase in c3-opsonization was noted for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.01 ) , but diabetic rats compared with insulin - rescued rats at 24 hours after infection did not show a significant difference ( figure 4(b ) ) . in order to confirm flow cytometry c3-opsonization results , we also performed elisa measurements of c3-fragments stripped from the s. aureus surface and normalized for numbers of bacteria present . consistent with the flow cytometry data , at 2 hours after infection , a trend towards increased c3-fragment opsonization was noted for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.06 ) ( figure 4(c ) ) . at 24 hours after infection , a small but statistically significant increase in c3-fragment opsonization was found for insulin - rescued rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.05 ) . in order to evaluate the forms of c3 bound to s. aureus , we performed c3 western blot analysis on bacteria recovered at 2 hours after infection . no demonstrable c3b could be identified , but a mixture of opsonic ic3b and nonopsonic c3d was recovered from the surface of s. aureus from both euglycemic and diabetic rats ( figure 4(d ) ) . together these results suggest that hyperglycemia inhibits complement opsonization of s. aureus early in infection and that insulin rescue may improve c4-mediated opsonization . neutrophil migration into the peritoneum in response to complement activation and anaphylatoxin is well established [ 18 , 19 , 31 ] . in order to evaluate hyperglycemic effects on neutrophil migration in response to anaphylatoxin generation , we performed leukocyte counts on peritoneal wash fluids by microscopy of cytospin slides . after 2 hours of infection , nearly all of the leukocytes were neutrophils and both groups showed a considerable increase over baseline value with diabetic rats demonstrating a 2-fold increase in leukocytes compared with euglycemic rats ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 5(a ) ) . the finding of increased neutrophils present for diabetic rats at 2 hours after infection was surprising given the increased levels of c3a present in the peritoneum of euglycemic rats . however , our previous s. aureus dose ranging experiments showed that an i.p . dose of 10  cfu yielded fewer recovered bacteria and fewer recovered neutrophils compared with a dose of 10  cfu ( figures 5(d ) and 5(e ) ) . microscopic examination of the slides from rats dosed with 10  cfu demonstrated more cellular debris , suggesting that there may be an increased inflammatory response at 10  cfu resulting in more bacterial killing by neutrophils as well as increased neutrophil death . in order to evaluate whether there could be increased neutrophil death for the euglycemic rats , we measured myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) activity and free dna in the peritoneal lavage fluid using tmb and picogreen , respectively ( figures 5(b ) and 5(c ) ) . at 2 hours after infection , myeloperoxidase activity was increased 1.7-fold for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.04 ) and free dna was increased by 1.6-fold for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.03 ) . these results suggest that the increased numbers of neutrophils present in the peritoneum of diabetic rats at 2 hours after infection may in part be due to less neutrophil death from activation and degranulation . this is consistent with the expectation that neutrophils in the euglycemic rats will undergo increased phagocytosis and degranulation due to stimulation by c3a compared with diabetic rats . in order to evaluate the downstream effect of hyperglycemic inhibition of complement effectors against s. aureus we have previously shown in vitro that hyperglycemic inhibition of complement opsonization of s. aureus inhibits phagocytosis by euglycemic neutrophils . to evaluate the in vivo effects of hyperglycemia on neutrophil function in this rat model , neutrophil phagocytosis efficiency was assayed by fluorescence microscopy of acridine orange and crystal violet stained cytospin slides of peritoneal wash samples . at 2 hours after infection , euglycemic rats demonstrated a 1.6-fold increase in neutrophils phagocytosis of bacteria ( figure 6(a ) ) compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.02 ) . at 24 hours after infection there was no significant difference between groups . at 2 hours after infection , the number of bacteria phagocytized by 100 neutrophils ( figure 6(b ) ) was increased 3-fold in euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats ( p = 0.02 ) . there was a nonsignificant trend towards increased numbers of bacteria phagocytized at 24 hours after infection in insulin - rescued rats ( p = 0.1 ) . s. aureus survival in the rat peritoneum was assessed by colony counting of peritoneal wash samples . at 2 hours after infection , s. aureus survival was 3-fold higher in diabetic rats compared with hyperglycemic rats ( p = 0.03 ) ( figure 6(c ) ) . at 24 hours after infection there was no statistically significant difference in s. aureus survival between diabetic and insulin - rescued rats . taken together , these results suggest that hyperglycemic inhibition of complement effectors in s. aureus peritonitis may contribute to decreased phagocytosis efficiency and increased bacterial survival , at least early in infection . these experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of hyperglycemia on complement effectors against s. aureus in a rat model of peritoneal infection . hyperglycemia adversely affected the early ( i.e. , 2-hour ) influx of critical humoral immune components to the site of s. aureus infection . a likely explanation for this effect is hyperglycemia inhibiting s. aureus activation of complement components already present in the peritoneum at the time of inoculation . previous investigators have shown that complement activation in the peritoneum greatly increases vascular permeability and leakage of plasma proteins via anaphylatoxin . our data show there are low concentrations of igg , c4 , and c3 present in peritoneal fluid in the absence of infection . hyperglycemia inhibition of s. aureus - initiated complement activation at the time of inoculation , as suggested by our in vitro data , would decrease the amount of anaphylatoxins generated by the complement components already present in the peritoneal fluid . uninhibited anaphylatoxin generation , as would be expected for the euglycemic animals , should increase histamine release and increase vascular permeability   facilitating the extravascular transit of plasma components . evaluation of these relatively short - lived anaphylatoxins minutes after infection could potentially be more revealing . reversal of hyperglycemia by administering insulin improved the influx of humoral immune components to the site of infection at 24 hours after infection compared with animals that did not receive insulin . c3a and these results suggest that reversing hyperglycemic conditions may enhance anaphylatoxin generation and increase humoral immune component influx to the site of infection . thus , these results suggest that hyperglycemia inhibits early humoral responses to s. aureus infection and that these effects can be reversed , at least partially , with insulin therapy . opsonization of s. aureus in euglycemic rats was increased for both c4-fragments and c3-fragments at 2 hours after infection compared with diabetic rats . these findings demonstrate that a hyperglycemic environment inhibits s. aureus - initiated complement activation and opsonization of s. aureus , consistent with our prior in vitro findings . decreased c4-fragment opsonization in hyperglycemic conditions suggests that the classical pathway , or lectin pathway , or both , may have been inhibited . it is also possible that high glucose environments may have a direct effect on the c4 molecule , as we demonstrated   for the evolutionarily related c3 molecule . alternatively , excess glucose may alter the surface of microbial pathogens inhibiting complement effectors , as has been shown for candida albicans [ 35 , 36 ] . phagocytosis of s. aureus by neutrophils was increased at 2 hours after infection for euglycemic rats compared with diabetic rats . this correlated inversely with s. aureus survival where diabetic rats showed increased numbers of live bacteria at 2 hours after infection compared with euglycemic rats . we have previously shown that hyperglycemic conditions inhibit complement - mediated opsonization of s. aureus resulting in decreased phagocytosis by euglycemic neutrophils , where neutrophil function was not affected by excess glucose . in these in vivo experiments , however , our prior in vitro findings and present demonstration of decreased complement opsonization of s. aureus in vivo suggest that hyperglycemic inhibition of complement responses to s. aureus likely contributed to decreased phagocytosis and increased bacterial survival for diabetic rats . in summary , these rat experiments show that hyperglycemia inhibited humoral effector recruitment , complement - mediated opsonization of s. aureus , and complement anaphylatoxin generation ( figure 7 ) . treatment with insulin after infection improved some of these complement effectors compared with persistent hyperglycemia .","hyperglycemia from diabetes is associated with increased risk of infection from s. aureus and increased severity of illness . 
 previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that elevated glucose ( > 6  mm ) dramatically inhibited s. aureus - initiated complement - mediated immune effectors . here 
 we report in vivo studies evaluating the extent to which a hyperglycemic environment alters complement - mediated control of s. aureus infection in a rat peritonitis model . 
 rats were treated with streptozocin to induce diabetes or sham - treated and then inoculated i.p . with s. aureus . 
 rats were euthanized and had peritoneal lavage at 2 or 24 hours after infection to evaluate early and late complement - mediated effects . 
 hyperglycemia decreased the influx of igg and complement components into the peritoneum in response to s. aureus infection and decreased anaphylatoxin generation . 
 hyperglycemia decreased c4-fragment and c3-fragment opsonization of s. aureus recovered in peritoneal fluids , compared with euglycemic or insulin - rescued rats . 
 hyperglycemic rats showed decreased phagocytosis efficiency compared with euglycemic rats , which correlated inversely with bacterial survival . 
 these results suggest that hyperglycemia inhibited humoral effector recruitment , anaphylatoxin generation , and complement - mediated opsonization of s. aureus , suggesting that hyperglycemic inhibition of complement effectors may contribute to the increased risk and severity of s. aureus infections in diabetic patients .",316
"while adipose tissue has in the past been viewed as a depot involved in passive storage of energy , it is increasingly clear that it is in fact a highly active tissue . it is an endocrine organ , secreting various cytokines and regulating metabolism of other organs . adipose tissue affects not only body weight , but also insulin sensitivity , atherogenesis , blood pressure , and other physiological functions . the body has several depots of white adipose tissue , of which the major two categories are subcutaneous and visceral , although visceral fat can be divided into subcategories of intraperitoneal , retroperitoneal , and pelvic . most studies have shown relatively little difference in the fatty acid composition of the various fat stores including fat in serum . however , there is suggestion that this may not be the case in obese individuals   and kishino et al . reported that visceral fat thickness was positively correlated to levels of palmitic and saturate fatty acids in serum , but negatively correlated with levels of linoleic and polyunsaturated fatty acids . there is a growing body of evidence that many of the cytokines and growth factors have depot - specific distribution in human adipose tissue [ 57 ] . it is known that visceral fat correlates better with the development of insulin insensitivity and the metabolic syndrome than does subcutaneous fat , and this may be related to the demonstrations that there is greater glucose uptake   and insulin metabolism   in visceral fat . persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) are highly lipophilic chemicals that bioaccumulate in animal and human fats . pops includes chemicals such as dioxins / furans , polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) , chlorinated pesticides , brominated flame retardants , and perfluorinated compounds . because of chlorine , bromine , or fluoride groups on the hydrocarbon rings or chains , these substances are resistant to degradation both in the environment and in the human body . the half - lives of substances such as dde , the major metabolite of ddt , and some pcb congeners are of the order of 510 years , and because of their presence in almost all animal fat consumed with the diet , the concentrations in the human body tend to increase with age because rates of intake exceed those of metabolism and excretion . while the manufacture and use of most of these chemicals has been prohibited in the us through the toxic substances control act of 1976 and their manufacture and use on a global scale is outlawed by the stockholm convention of the united nations which entered into force in 2004 , these toxic chemicals remain present in the bodies of most humans . pops are toxic to human health , being probable human carcinogens , having immunosuppressive activity , causing neurotoxicity , increasing risk of diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and hypertension , and being endocrine disruptive chemicals [ 11 , 12 ] . different pops often have somewhat different health outcomes , and most studies have focused on only single chemicals . however , since essentially all humans are exposed to many different pops , but perhaps in different relative concentrations , it is important to consider the health effects of chemical mixtures . multiple chemicals may have additive , less than additive , or synergistic effects . because pops are stored in adipose tissue and because the various adipose tissues of the body have somewhat different endocrine functions , it is important to know whether or not pops distribute equally throughout all adipose tissues and ultimately to determine how levels of these chemicals influence the local adipose tissue . have reported that pcb 77 but not pcb 153 induces adipocyte differentiation and expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines . this preliminary study of analysis of pcbs and chlorinated pesticides in various adipose tissues obtained from seven human subjects is a first attempt to determine whether the distributions of several pcb congeners and several chlorinated pesticides are the same in different adipose tissues . seven human subjects scheduled for elective surgery for either benign lesions or cancer provided informed consent for the surgical team to obtain blood and fat biopsies from several different fat compartments at the time of surgery for analysis of ten pcb congeners and 22 chlorinated pesticides . four subjects ( 3 males and 1 female ) presented with renal cell carcinoma , 1 male had a benign renal cyst , 1 male had a benign small intestinal tumor , and 1 male had prostate cancer . all subjects had preoperative cat scans of the abdomen and pelvis , bone scans , and complete blood metabolic studies . after blood samples were drawn , the surgeon excised samples of 5 grams or greater from the subcutaneous peripheral fat as well as from one or more intra - abdominal fat stores , including visceral , retroperitoneal , and pelvic fat as well as from the kidney or prostate that was removed at surgery . visceral fat commonly refers to adipose tissue within the peritoneal cavity . in some subjects , visceral fat from three different locations was obtained , the mesenteric fat from around the small and large intestines , omental fat from the folds of the peritoneum that connect the stomach with other abdominal organs , and fat from the falciform ligament that attaches part of the liver to the diaphragm and abdominal wall . retroperitoneal fat lies posterior to the peritoneal compartment and is separated from it by the posterior peritoneum . retroperitoneal fat surrounds the adrenal glands , pancreas , kidneys , and the great vessels as well as large lymphatic channels . the pelvic fat compartment is an inferior extension of the retroperitoneal fat and surrounds the iliac vessels , rectum , bladder , and prostate in males . figure 1 shows the location of the various fat stores as well as the major abdominal organs . serum and fat samples were analyzed by accu - chem laboratories , richardson , tx . pcbs and chlorinated pesticides were extracted into hexane after the addition of an internal standard ( 2,2,3,3,4,5,5,6-octachlorobiphenyl ) . the solvent was then evaporated to dryness and the sample reconstituted and analyzed on a gas chromatograph ( hewlett packard 5890 ) equipped with an electron capture detector using a hewlett packard 5970 mass spectrometer and a db5 capillary column . three sets of standard references were used , one from the national institute of standards and technology and two commercially available reference sets . the level of detection was 0.15  ng / ml and the level of quantitation was 0.3  ng / ml . twenty three chlorinated pesticides were measured , including hexachlorobenzene ( hcb ) , endrin ,  ,  ,  , and  hexachlorocyclohexane ( hch ) , heptachlor , heptachlor epoxide ,  , and  chlordane , oxychlordane , trans - nonachlor , endosulfan i and ii , endosulfan sulfate , aldrin , dieldrin , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene ( dde ) , dichlordiphenyltrichlorethane ( ddt ) , dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane ( ddd ) , methoxychlor , mirex and endrin aldehyde . ten pcb congeners were analyzed including pcbs 47 ( 2,2,4,4 ) , 105 ( 2,3,3,4,4 ) , 118 ( 2,3,4,4,5 ) , 137 ( 2,2,3,4,4,5 ) , 138 ( 2,2,3,4,4,5 ) , 153 ( 2,24,4,5,5 ) , 170 ( 2,23,34,4,5 ) , 171 ( 2,23,3,4,4,6 ) , 180 ( 2,23,4,45.5 ) , and 183 ( 2,23,4,4,5,6 ) . all results are reported as wet weight values , based in part on the basis of the demonstration [ 15 , 16 ] that lipid adjustment increases the bias in the measurement . the limits of detection were 0.3  ppb in serum , 10  ppb in fat and kidney cancer tissue , and 35.7  ppb in cancerous tissue . table 1 gives the results of pesticide levels in the various samples from the seven subjects , while table 2 provides similar information for pcb congeners . of the 23 pesticides monitored , none of the samples showed levels of aldrin ,  and  chlordane ,  and  hch , endosulfan ii , endosulfan sulfate , ddd , ddt , endrin aldehyde , or methoxychlor above the level of quantitation , while for pcb congeners levels of pcbs 47 and 171 were not found in any tissue at concentrations above the levels of quantitation . figure 2(a ) shows the average levels of selected pesticides in serum and various adipose tissues . figure 2(b ) shows the same data without dde , which is present at much higher concentrations than any other pesticide . this figure clearly shows that there are some differences in the patterns , most striking in the one individual from whom a pelvic sample was obtained . the differences are less clear for those tissues for which more samples were obtained . figure 4 shows a plot of oxychlordane concentration in visceral versus subcutaneous adipose tissues and demonstrates that there is a very close relationship with an r of 0.939 , p = .0003 . the results of this investigation show a much more complex picture for the distribution of pesticides and pcbs in various adipose tissue pools than expected . it is usually assumed that in a fasting person ( all of these surgical patients were fasting ) , pops will be equally distributed in all adipose tissue sites , and consequently one can obtain use serum samples to monitor body burden of lipophilic substances . while serum usually contains somewhere between 14% lipid , the assumption is that the pops concentrations in the serum lipid fraction reflect all adipose tissue . in the past , results were usually reported as lipid adjusted concentrations   although reports that lipid - adjustment creates bias   have resulted in more reports of wet weight values or using serum lipids as a covariate . unfortunately , the sensitivity used in the serum analyses in these subjects was not sufficiently sensitive so as to provide much basis for comparison , but there is valuable data from the different adipose tissue sites . it is clear that levels of individual pops in any one individual reflect both the degree and source of exposure , the time since that exposure occurred , genetic differences among individuals in rates of metabolism , body mass index and , if female , number of pregnancies and whether or not the child was breast fed . most metabolism of pops is a result of activity of cytochrome p450s , and the ability to metabolize individual pops varies with structure and genetic susceptibility . for pcbs , for example , congeners with fewer chlorines are in general more easily metabolized than those with more chlorines . thus , an individual with major exposure in the distant past will show a congener pattern dominated by higher chlorinated congeners . however one would assume that the same pattern would be found in the various fat stores .   for pcbs , there is reasonably good correlation between serum levels and those in subcutaneous fat for gk , hm , and as but not ms , go , and jt . when comparing the different adipose tissues , there is a clear tendency for visceral and retroperitoneal to have a greater percentage of higher chlorinated congeners than subcutaneous fat for gk , go and jt . however , for ml subcutaneous and visceral patterns were similar but concentrations higher than in retropertoneal fat . ms showed relatively similar patterns , but with concentrations in mesenteric fat considerably greater than in subcutaneous fat , while as showed higher concentrations in subcutaneous fat . hm , the only subject with pelvic fat , showed relatively similar concentrations for pcbs 118 , 138 , and 170 , but high levels of 153 in pelvic but not subcutaneous and of 180 in subcutaneous but not pelvic fat . dde was present in the highest concentration in most samples , but was below the detection limit in subcutaneous fat in gk and jt in spite of being present at high concentrations in serum and other adipose tissues . in all other subjects , dieldrin , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane , and transnonachlor were present in most adipose samples and had relatively similar distributions in all fat stores . hch was present in comparable amounts in most samples that contained measureable levels , and hch was found in only a few samples . mirex was found in serum at a relatively high concentration in gk , but was not present in any adipose tissue , and similar situation was found with heptachlor in ml . these results suggest a very recent exposure to these two pops that has not yet equilibrated with adipose tissue . when comparing general levels of pcbs to those of the pesticides , distributions were similar for ml , hm , and go . however for as and jt , pcbs were at higher concentrations in subcutaneous fat , but pesticides were at higher concentration in visceral and retroperitoneal fat . for ms levels of pcbs were greater in subcutaneous than visceral fat , but levels of pesticides were approximately equal in the two stores . only one cancerous tissue ( kidney ) gave detectible levels of pops , and it contained pcb 153 and oxychlorodane at relatively low concentrations , but no other pops . these two pops were present in the highest concentration in subcutaneous fat . since the lipid content of a tumor would be expected to be significantly less than adipose tissue , the relative wet weight results are not surprising . it is unlikely that the variable results seen in levels of both pcb and pesticides are due to chance or to faulty chemical analysis . there is always some variability in analysis of pops , but usually this is not more than 20% . there are reports that there are large differences in the average fatty acid composition between individual subjects , as well as some differences in composition of different adipose tissue sites within subjects . if this is the case , it is possible that the lipid composition of the various adipose tissue stores is reflected in different solubility of individual pops in different depots even in the same individual . even subcutaneous fat taken from different parts of the body has been found to show between 210% variation [ 2 , 20 ] . there is some information suggesting that subcutaneous and visceral fats differ more , with saturated fats higher and monounsaturated fat lower in visceral than subcutaneous fat . since p450 enzymes are found in almost all cells , not just liver , it is conceivable that there is different metabolism in different fat depots . certainly there is evidence that different depots express different endocrine factors . however , unless the pops were bound in some fashion , it seems unlikely that even if there were differences in local metabolism that there would not be a relatively rapid redistribution . they reported six pops where serum levels correlated relatively well with those in adipose tissues , but no clear relationship with the other nine pops . the mean adipose / serum ratios varied from 2.85 for endosulfan - ether to a high of 150.68 for dde and 159.47 for endosulfan ii . they questioned the common assumption that serum concentrations are indicative of those in adipose tissues . our results are consistent with their observations and indicate that the same surprising relationship may also occur with different pcb congeners . there are major limitations to this study because of small sample size , lack of measurement of the lipid content of tissues , and the relatively low sensitivity of the analytical methods . however , the difficulty in obtaining samples and the lack of any comparable study elsewhere in light of the overall importance of the question of how different pops distribute in different adipose tissue depots is justification for publishing these results . replication is certainly needed to confirm the overall conclusion that pops do not always distribute equally among various lipid compartment in the human body . contrary to expectations that patterns of various pesticides and pcb congeners were not as similar as expected when comparing levels in serum , subcutaneous , visceral , retroperitoneal , and pelvic fat . these results indicate that care should be taken when assuming that serum levels of pops reflect patterns found in lipid stores throughout the body .","background . chemicals that store in lipid - rich compartments have the potential for long - term disruption of metabolic and endocrine processes . given the evidence that persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) also alter systemic metabolic , endocrine , and immune system functions , it follows that elevated chemical concentrations in intra - abdominal fat may alter function , through local chemical signaling , of visceral organs . despite this potential , 
 there has been little study defining pop concentrations in live human intra - abdominal fat . 
 it is at present uncertain whether pops distribute equally to all fat compartments , including fat in serum . methods . 
 seven human subjects scheduled for elective surgery for benign lesions or cancer provided consent for removal of samples of subcutaneous and intra - abdominal fat and/or cancerous tissue . 
 these samples were analyzed for 22 chlorinated pesticides and 10 polychlorinated biphenyl ( pcb ) congeners by gc / ecd plus gc / ms . 
 results . in only two subjects were the patterns and relative concentrations of pcbs and pesticides about the same in all fat compartments . in the other subjects , there were major differences in levels in subcutaneous as compared to other compartments , but with some higher and some lower . while the pattern of pcbs in the various compartments matched that of the pesticides in some , it was opposite in others . interpretation . 
 these results demonstrate a complicated distribution of pcb congeners and pesticides in various lipid compartments . 
 the difference may reflect various kows , different rates of metabolism , and/or different lengths of exposure . 
 but the results suggest that contaminant levels in serum or even subcutaneous fat do not necessarily indicate concentrations and patterns in other kinds of adipose tissue .",332
"this cross - sectional case - control study was performed in the following 3 belarusian medical hospitals : republic clinical hospital of medical rehabilitation ( minsk , belarus ) , 1st minsk city clinical hospital ( minsk , belarus ) , and 10th minsk city clinical hospital ( minsk , belarus ) . from 2007 to 2011 , a total of 200 consecutive t1d patients were evaluated . the diagnosis of t1d was based on the american diabetes association criteria ( 6 ) . inclusion criteria were as follows : age between 20 and 55 years , duration of disease 2 years , and eugonadal status . the exclusion criteria were as follows : 1 ) the presence of severe chronic kidney disease , 2 ) the presence or history of diseases and syndromes associated with low bmd ( i.e. , noncompensated hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism , hyperparathyroidism , intestinal malabsorption , inflammatory bowel disease , or history of malignancy ) , 3 ) intake of drugs that can influence bone metabolism , 4 ) the pregnancy and lactation periods , and 5 ) the presence of acute infectious disease . ultimately , 82 t1d patients were enrolled . in the same period , 82 healthy subjects were recruited as controls among 932 subjects referred to our outpatient clinic by health providers of general medicine for the suspicion of hypothyroidism or hashimoto thyroiditis . the control subjects were enrolled in the study if they had normal thyroid function and negative autoimmunity and if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria ( age 2055 years , eugonadal status ) without any exclusion criteria ( the presence of diabetes mellitus ; the presence or history of diseases and syndromes associated with low bmd , such as hyperparathyroidism , intestinal malabsorption , inflammatory bowel disease , or history of malignancy ; intake of drugs that can influence bone metabolism ; the pregnancy and lactation periods ; and the presence of acute infectious disease ) . all subjects gave their witnessed , informed consent before entering the study , which was approved by local ethical committees and conducted in accordance with helsinki declaration ii . in all patients and controls , height and weight were measured and bmi was calculated . in all subjects , bmd was assessed with dxa ( prodigy lunar ; general electric medical systems ) and expressed as sd units ( z - values ) in relation to an age - matched reference population at both lumbar spine ( z - ls ) and femoral neck ( z - fn ) . bmd was adjusted for weight and classified as normal , osteopenic , or osteoporotic on the basis of z - ls or z - fn bmd ( 7 ) . we decided to use both z - score and t - score because the sample was composed of premenopausal women and men younger than 50 years . indeed , as stated by the international society of clinical densitometry ( 7 ) , t - score and z - score are equal for young people aged between 20 and 50 years . in addition , the t - score yields important clinical information regarding the presence or absence of osteoporosis , whereas the use of z - score normalizes for age . only 1 subject among both patients and controls was older than 50 years ( a 54-year - old premenopausal woman ) , and we decided not to eliminate her from the study . data from lumbar spine scans were used only if at 3 vertebrae were visualized without interfering artifacts . the coefficient of variation bmd measurements at lumbar spine and femoral neck was < 1.5% . x - ray loading in one projection was 0.04 msv . in both t1d patients and controls , the presence of morphometric vfx was assessed with dxa with the software vertebral fracture assessment ( vfa ) from t4 to l4 vertebrae . this software is a program within the prodigy lunar system , including a lateral projection of the spine . the manufacturer refers to this lateral projection as  dual - energy vertebral assessment , dva . each vertebra was considered as intact ( grade 0 ) or as having approximately mild ( 2025% compression ) , moderate ( 2540% compression ) , or severe ( > 40% compression ) deformity ( grades 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively).the dxa and vfa reviewers were blinded to the presence of diabetes . in all patients with evidence of a vfx on vfa , conventional spinal radiographs in lateral ( t4l4 ) and anteroposterior projection ( l1l4 ) were obtained . in all cases , diabetic neuropathy evaluation was based on symptoms , quantitative sensory testing ( temperature , vibration , and pressure perception ) and quantitative motor testing ( patellar and ankle reflexes ) . diabetic nephropathy was assessed by measuring microalbumin in 24-h urine samples ( normal values < 30 mg / day ) twice ( at enrolment and after 36 months ) to determine persistent microalbuminuria . microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were diagnosed on the basis of albumin excretion rate between 30 and 300 mg / day or > 300 mg / day , respectively ( 9 ) . for each patient , the diabetes complication score was calculated on the basis of the presence of 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 complications among neuropathy , retinopathy , and nephropathy ( score of 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 , respectively ) . venous blood samples were taken from all t1d patients in the morning before the insulin injection after a 10-h fast , centrifuged , and stored at 70c until analysis . glycosylated hemoglobin ( hba1c , normal value 4.06.0% ) and serum creatinine were measured by high - performance liquid chromatography with autoanalyzer d10 ( bio - rad ) and with analyzer hitachi 911 ( roche diagnostics , germany ) , respectively . creatinine clearance ( clcr ) was calculated with the formula of cockcroft - gault : clcr ( ml / min ) = [ 140  age ( years )  weight ( kg)/72  11.3  serum creatinine ( mmol / l ) ] for males and clcr ( ml / min ) = 0.85  [ 140  age ( years )  weight ( kg)/72  11.3  serum creatinine ( mmol / l ) ] for females ( 9 ) . because all t1d patients had completed complex education aimed at diabetes management in everyday life , all were motivated to complete standardized physical activity 30 min / day 5 days / week ( a brisk walk , jogging , swimming , bicycling outside and indoors , dancing , playing tennis ) , as recommended by the american diabetes association ( 6 ) . during the personal visit , the patients were asked how much time in a day and how many days in a week they spent on physical activity as previously described . the average values of physical activity in a week and in a day ( expressed as hours / day ) were then calculated . statistical analysis was performed with the spss version 18.0 statistical package ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny ) . the comparison of continuous variables between patients and controls was performed with the student t test or mann - whitney u test as appropriate . general linear modeling was performed to compare the continuous variables between patients and controls after adjusting for age . the associations between variables were tested by either pearson or spearman correlation , as appropriate . multivariate logistic or linear regression analysis assessed the association between the presence of morphometric vfx ( categorical dependent variable ) and the following independent variables : age , sex , bmi , lumbar spine bmd , score of diabetes complications ( expressed as a continuous variable ) , and physical activity . statistical analysis was performed with the spss version 18.0 statistical package ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny ) . the comparison of continuous variables between patients and controls was performed with the student t test or mann -

ls 4.17 [ 0.4835.70 ] ; p = 0.20 ; complication score 1.43 [ 0.248.46 ] ; p = 0.69 ; physical activity 1.01 [ 0.991.04 ] ; p = 0.27 ) . to our knowledge , this is the first study evaluating the prevalence of morphometric vfx in patients with t1d . we found that bmd is decreased and the prevalence of morphometric vfx is increased in t1d patients . it is well known that t1d patients frequently show low bone mass , the pathogenesis of which is still not clear ( 2,3 ) . in this study , we confirmed that adults with t1d have significantly lower bmd and higher prevalence of low bmd ( z - score bmd less than 1.0 ) both at the lumbar spine and at the femoral neck relative to controls , as already suggested by previous studies ( 1,4 ) . in addition to low bone mass , t1d has been suggested to be characterized by elevated risk of clinical fractures ( 1,2,10 ) ; this also is consistent with our results , because in this study about 25% of t1d patients had vfx . on the other side , it has been recently suggested that fractures in t1d might be not entirely explained by reduced bmd ( 1 ) , as happens in several forms of secondary osteoporosis ( 11 ) . this is in keeping with the results of the logistic regression analysis ( table 4 ) , which confirms the association of t1d with the presence of vfx regardless of bmd . when limiting the analysis to the moderate or severe fractures , bmd but not t1d was found to be associated with vfx . these apparently discordant findings may have arisen because the reduction of bmd remains crucial and overcomes the role of t1d when only more severe vfx is considered . it is not possible , however , to exclude the possibility that the number of patients with moderate or severe vfx ( n = 5 ) was insufficient to evaluate the effect of t1d reliably in this subset of patients . notwithstanding these limits , these finding are of clinical importance , because the prevalence of vfx predicts future fractures regardless of bmd ( 5 ) and because the recognition of vfx by imaging of the spine may change the patient diagnostic classification , estimation of fracture risk , and threshold for pharmacological intervention . in our sample , no potential risk factors for vfx other than bmd ( among age , sex , bmi , physical activity , and complications ) were found to be significantly associated with the presence of vfx in the logistic regression analysis ( table 4 ) . because t1d patients with vfx tended to have higher complication score and higher prevalence of diabetes complications , in particular retinopathy and neuropathy , the presence of chronic diabetes complications might be an adjunctive tool in addition to bmd in evaluating risk factors for fractures in t1d . the statistical significance for complication score was not reached , possibly because of the large sd and the relatively small number of patients with vfx . the link between the presence of the chronic complications and the presence of osteoporosis in t1d is debated ( 1218 ) . recently , the presence of the chronic diabetes complications has been shown to be associated with low bmd in t1d ( 4 ) . 10 ) showed that the complications of diabetes other than diabetic kidney disease add little to the overall risk of fracture . some data suggest that the nonenzymatic glycosylation of type 1 collagen , with subsequent formation of advanced glycation end products , has a negative impact on mechanical properties of cancellous and cortical bone . the alteration of the organic matrix in bone by advanced glycation end products could be relevant to increased bone fragility with aging and in such disease as diabetes ( 19,20 ) . this is a suitable explanation for poor bone quality in t1d . in this study , the lack of association between bmd and vfx in t1d patients may suggest the loss of bone quality as a cause of the increased vfx prevalence in t1d patients . first , we measured hba1c only at enrollment . because hba1c levels are representative of the metabolic status of the last 3 months , we could not exclude the possibility that the metabolic status of an individual subject was different during the previous years and therefore not reliably mirrored by the current hba1c levels . this technique uses a lower radiation level than standard radiography ; however , it also provides lower image resolution ( 21 ) . it has a good sensitivity ( 8793% ) and specificity ( 9395% ) for detecting moderate and severe vfx , but its performance for diagnosing mild vfx in the presence of scoliosis or osteoarthritis has been questioned ( 21 ) . in our sample , however , no subjects had severe osteoarthritis , and an anteroposterior view of the spine by vfa was obtained to identify the patients with scoliosis . moreover , in all patients with evidence of a vfx at vfa , the conventional spinal radiographs confirmed the vfa results , and even after excluding patients with mild fractures , the results were substantially confirmed . finally , another limitation of this study is related to its cross - sectional design , which does not allow assessment of causality but only of association between variables . in conclusion , this study confirms that bmd is reduced in t1d . moreover , it shows that the prevalence of morphometric vfx is increased in t1d and not associated only with the reduction of bmd .","objectiveseveral studies showed low bone mineral density ( bmd ) and elevated risk of symptomatic fractures in patients with type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) . to our knowledge 
 , there has been no investigation on the prevalence of asymptomatic vertebral fractures ( vfx ) in t1d . in the current study , we assessed bmd and the prevalence of vfx in t1d.research design and methodswe evaluated 82 t1d patients ( 26 males and 56 females , aged 31.1  8.6 years , bmi 23.5  3.3 kg / m2 , disease duration 12.8  8.3 years ) and 82 controls ( 22 females and 60 males , aged 32.9  5.8 years , bmi 23.9  4.8 kg / m2 ) . 
 spinal and femoral bmd ( as z - score , z - ls and z - fn , respectively ) and the prevalence of vfx were evaluated by dual x - ray absorptiometry.resultst1d patients had lower z - ls and z - fn than controls ( 0.55  1.3 vs. 0.35  1.0 , p < 0.0001 , and 0.64  1.1 vs. 0.29  0.9 , p < 0.0001 , respectively ) and a higher prevalence of vfx ( 24.4 vs. 6.1% , p = 0.002 ) . 
 age , diabetes duration , age at diabetes manifestation , glycosylated hemoglobin , z - ls , z - fn , and the prevalence of chronic complications were similar for patients with and without vfx . in the logistic regression analysis , 
 the presence of vfx was associated with the presence of t1d but not with lumbar spine bmd . whereas moderate or severe vfx was associated with low lumbar spine bmd in the whole combined group of t1d patients and controls , there was no association between moderate or severe vfx and lumbar spine bmd in the t1d group.conclusionst1d patients 
 have low bmd and elevated prevalence of asymptomatic vfx , which is associated with the presence of t1d independently of bmd .",482
"oral drug delivery systems are essential to optimize both the residence time of the system within the gastrointestinal tract and the release rate of the drug from the system . various attempts have been made to prolong the residence time of the dosage forms within the stomach . rapid gastrointestinal transit could result in incomplete drug release from the drug delivery system to absorption window leading to diminished efficacy of the administered dose . prolonged gastric retention is important in achieving control over the gastric residence time because it helps to maintain the controlled release system in the stomach for a longer time in an expected manner . floating systems ( hydrodynamically controlled systems ) are low - density systems which means they are less dense than gastric fluid . these systems have sufficient buoyancy to float over the gastric contents and remain buoyant in the stomach for a prolonged period of time without disturbing the gastric emptying rate . while the formulation is floating on the gastric contents , drug is released slowly from it at a desired rate [ 3 , 4 ] . for oral sustained release , multiple unit dosage forms ( i.e. , microballoons ) are more beneficial than single unit dosage forms . because single unit dosage forms have the disadvantage of a release all or nothing emptying process and multiple unit dosage forms have advantages of disperse widely and release drug uniformly along the gastrointestinal tract , which results in more reproducible drug absorption , less dose dumping , and reduced risk of local irritation than the use of single unit dosage form [ 57 ] . these microballoons are characteristically free flowing powders consisting of proteins or synthetic polymers , ideally having a size less than 200  m . pentoxifylline ( ptx ) , trisubstituted xanthine derivative ( 3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-dihydro-1h - purine-2,6-dione ) , is a hemorheologic agent used for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication . the apparent plasma half - life of the drug and its metabolite is 2 - 3 hours . on the basis of using ptx as drug of choice in chronic occlusive aterial diseases , it is of a wise candidate drug to be formulated in sustained release oral dosage form . thus , the aim of the present research work was to design , develope , and characterization of pentoxifylline loaded floating microballoons . mumbai , india . ethyl cellulose , hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( hpmc k4 m ) , and tween 80 were purchased from central drug house ( cdh ) , new delhi , india . all other solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade . pentoxifylline , hpmc k4 m , and ethyl cellulose were dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and dichloromethane at room temperature . these were poured into 250  ml of water containing 0.01% tween 80 maintained at a temperature of 3040c and consequently stirred at ranging agitation speed to allow the volatile solvent to evaporate . the formulated microballoons were filtered , washed with distilled water , and dried at 40c . the size of microballoons of each formulation was determined using a microscope fitted with an ocular micrometer , and stage micrometer and average particle size was determined . the surface morphology of microballoons was examined by scanning electron microscopy ( jeol jsm-1600 , tokyo , japan ) operated at 15  kv on samples gold sputtered at 10  ma , under argon at low pressure . the weight of microballoons was divided by the total weight of all the nonvolatile components that were used for the preparation of the microballoons and multiplied by 100 gives the % yield of microballoons   as follows : 
 ( 1)%  yield=(weight  of  microballoons  collected )  (weight  of  all  nonvolatile  components  used  for  the  preparation)1100 . 
 percentage loading efficiency .  to determine loading efficiency , microballoons were taken , thoroughly triturated , and suspended in a minimal amount of alcohol . the estimation of drug was carried out using uv spectrophotometer ( uv - vis double beam spectrophotometer 2201 , systronics ) at 272  nm max . the percentage loading efficiency was calculated as follows : 
 ( 2)loading  efficiency  ( % )  = amount  of  drug  actually  presenttheoretical  drug  load  expected100 . the buoyancy test of the microballoons was carried out using usp ii ( paddle type ) dissolution apparatus ( ds 8000 , labindia ) . dissolution test solution simulated gastric fluid ( sgf ) containing tween 80 ( 0.02% v / v ) was used as a dispersion medium to simulate gastric fluid . the microballoons were spread over the surface of the sgf , ph 1.2 ( 900  ml , 37  0.5c ) , which was agitated by a paddle rotated at 100  rpm for 12  h. after agitation for a previously determined interval , the microballoons that were floating and the ones that settled to the bottom of the flask were recovered separately . after drying , the fraction of the microballoons was weighed . the % buoyancy of the microballoons was calculated by the following formula : 
 ( 3)%  buoyancy = weight  of  floating  microballoons  after  dryingweight  of  floating+settled  microballoons  after  drying  100 . 
 in vitro drug release studies . the dissolution test was performed using 0.1  n  hcl ( ph 1.2 ) as dissolution fluid ( 900  ml ) maintained at 37  0.5c at 100  rpm . the samples ( 5  ml ) of the solution were withdrawn from the dissolution apparatus for 12  h , and the samples were replaced with fresh dissolution medium each time to maintain the sink condition . withdrawn samples were analyzed using uv - vis double beam spectrophotometer at 272  nm against suitably constructed calibration curve . all measurements were carried out in triplicate , and average values were plotted .  
 statistical analysis . two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied to check significant differences in drug release from different formulations . the kinetic models used were zero order ( cumulative percentage of drug release versus time ) , first order ( log cumulative percentage of drug remaining versus time ) , the higuchi model ( cumulative percentage of drug release versus square root of time ) , and korsmeyer - peppas ( log cumulative percent drug release versus log of time ) . regression ( r ) values were calculated for the linear curves obtained by regression analysis . preparation of pentoxifylline loaded floating microballoons was done by using hpmc k4 m and ethyl cellulose as sustained release polymers by the solvent evaporation technique . ethanol and dichloromethane were used as solvents to keep both polymers and drug in solution . the solution was poured with the help of syringe into 250  ml water containing 0.01% tween 80 maintained at a temperature of 3040c and subsequently stirred at ranging agitation speed to allow the volatile solvent to evaporate . the formulations f1 , f2 , and f3 were formulated by varying the concentration of ethyl cellulose , and formulations f4 , f5 , and f6 formulated by varying the concentration of hpmc k4 m . microballoons with higher concentration of ethyl cellulose gave much retarded drug release than higher concentration of hpmc k4 m . from the result of this study , the average particle size of microballoons were found to be 74.63  1.04 , 85.18  3.12 , and 104.0  2.87 for f1 , f2 , and f3 formulations and 82.96  2.13 , 99.32  1.45 , and 110.4  2.94 for f4 , f5 , and f6 formulations , respectively . this is due to the increase in viscosity of the solution and the decrease in stirring efficiency . also with increasing polymer concentration , therefore , a shorter time was provided for the breakup of droplets , and larger microballoons were formed . the scanning electron microphotograph showed that the developed floating microballoons were spherical with porous surface which facilitate diffusion of drug as shown in figure 1 . production yields were found to be 75.76  1.54 , 78.13  1.21 , 80.89  2.24 , 76.79  1.38 , 74.66  2.61 , and 72.57  1.85 for f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 , and f6 formulations , respectively , as shown in table 2 . the percentage loading efficiencies were found to be 75.5  1.82 , 76.36  1.27 ,  77.85  0.61 , 76.22  0.82 , 77.29  0.12 , and 77.66  1.35% for f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 , and f6 formulations , respectively . the buoyancy percentage for all batches was almost above 70% , which was studied for 12  h. the highest percentage was obtained with formulation f6 . average buoyancies in percentage were found to be in the range of 72.43  0.21% to 78.19  0.63% for f1 to f6 formulations . in general , with the increase in the amount of polymers , there was an increase in the buoyancy percentage . the increase in the buoyancy percentage may be attributed to air and gel - forming polymer hpmc k4 m which caused swelling because of increased amount of the polymers present . the in vitro drug release of formulations f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f5 , and f6 was found to be 96.81  0.16 , 88.84  0.46 , 82.21  1.29 , 93.13  1.48 , 90.16  0.98 , and 87.09  1.73 in 12  h , respectively . results indicate that proportion of polymers in formulation was the key factor governing the release of drug from microballoons . as the concentration of polymer increased , there was an increase in diffusional path length . formulations comprised of ethyl cellulose in higher proportion exhibited much retarded drug release as compared to formulations comprised of hpmc k4 m in higher proportion . the release profile of pentoxifylline from microballoons for all formulations was shown in figure 2 . the release profile of pentoxifylline from microballoons containing varying concentrations of ethyl cellulose and hpmc two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied to check significant differences in drug release from different formulations containing different concentrations of hpmc k4 m and ethyl cellulose . on increasing the amount of polymers , a significant decrease ( p < 0.05 ) was obtained in the cumulative drug release . the kinetics and mechanism of drug release were determined using zero order , and first order , higuchi 's model , and further analysis was performed using korsmeyer - peppas equation . all formulations were found to be following higuchi 's model as the plot showed high linearity ( r = 0.985 to 0.991 ) as shown in table 3 . this equation indicates that the cumulative amount of drug release is proportional to the square root of time for diffusional release of drug from the formulation . n  values from the power law equation ( korsmeyer - peppas equation ) for drug release profiles were between 0.776 and 0.842 , suggesting that drug release mechanism from formulations followed the non - fickian ( anomalous ) transport mechanism , which may indicate that diffusion was predominant mechanism of drug release . the release kinetic data obtained from different plots of models for all formulations are given in table 3 . floating microballoons of pentoxifylline were prepared by the solvent evaporation technique using different concentrations of polymers like hpmc k4 m and ethyl cellulose ( ec ) dispersed in ethyl alcohol and dichloromethane as a solvent system . prepared floating microballoons showed significant floating ability , good buoyancy , and sustained drug release . in vitro drug release of microballoons was influenced by polymers concentration . from the percentage loading efficiency and in vitro drug release studies , it was observed that f3 formulation exhibits greater drug loading efficiency and sustained release behavior . on fixing the in vitro drug release data of optimized formulation to various kinetic models , it was found that it exhibits the higuchi order of kinetics followed by zero order and first order . the formulation undergoes anomalous ( non - fickian ) diffusion , which indicates that the drug release rate was controlled by swelling , erosion , and diffusion from microballoons . thus , pentoxifylline loaded floating microballoons can prove to be potential pharmaceutical dosage form for prolonging the gastric retention time of dosage form .","the floating microballoons have been utilized to obtain prolonged and uniform release in the stomach . 
 the objective of the present study involves design , development , and characterization of pentoxifylline loaded floating microballoons to prolong their gastric residence time . 
 pentoxifylline ( trisubstituted xanthine derivative ) loaded microballoons were prepared by the solvent evaporation technique using different concentrations of polymers like hpmc k4 m and ethyl cellulose ( ec ) in ethyl alcohol and dichloromethane organic solvent system . 
 microballoons were characterized for their particle size , surface morphology , production yield , loading efficiency , buoyancy percentage , and in vitro drug release studies . from the characterization 
 it was observed that increases in amount of polymers ( hpmc k4 m and ec ) led to increased particle size , loading efficiency , and buoyancy percentage , and retarded drug release . 
 the particle size , particle yield , loading efficiency , buoyancy percentage and in vitro drug release for optimized formulation ( f3 ) were found to be 104.0  2.87  m , 80.89  2.24% , 77.85  0.61% , 77.52  2.04% , and 82.21  1.29% , respectively .

"the golgi complex serves as the central station in the biosynthetic pathway , where proteins are sorted for their different destinations , such as various domains of the cell surface and the endosomal  lysosomal system . this delivery of cargo proteins from the golgi complex to their target compartments is carried out by dynamic , membrane - bound organelles that are frequently called either  transport carriers  or  post - golgi carriers  ( pgcs ) ( luini et al . as these pgcs have an important role in the process of intracellular transport , their morphology , living dynamics and molecular compositions have become the focus of significant interest , particularly over the last few years . these pgc transport organelles were originally defined through the development of green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) technology and living - cell imaging ( lippincott - schwartz et al . 2000 ) , whereby the first fluorescent cargo protein that was followed in living cells revealed a new world of images of these relatively large and highly dynamic structures that travel from the golgi complex to the plasma membrane ( wacker et al . 1997 1998 ) . then , with time , the list of cargo molecules that could be visualized in vivo expanded , further exposing the unexpected complexity of the post - golgi transport pathways . finally , further technical advances resulted in the combination of video and electron microscopy ( correlative light - electron microscopy , clem ) , which provided the means to define the morphogenesis of these pgcs at the ultrastructural level . as a result of these studies we now know that pgcs arise from specific membrane domains of the golgi complex that lack resident golgi enzymes , forming what are known as the  pgc precursors  ( hirschberg et al . the shapes and sizes of pgcs that even carry the same cargo can vary across a wide range , and under the light microscope , most of them are seen to be clearly larger that plasma - membrane associated clathrin vesicles and 100-nm fluorescent beads ( hirschberg et al . 1998 ) . the smaller pgcs usually have a size of 300400  nm , although some of the larger ones can reach several microns in length . video microscopy has also revealed that many of these carriers appear globular , although they frequently stretch out into tubular shapes during their translocation through the cytosol ; thus pgcs have frequently been termed as  pleiomorphic  structures . in transporting their cargoes to the correct acceptor compartments , however , carriers can also form and support post - golgi transport without microtubules , although the correct targeting of their cargo proteins is usually compromised under these conditions ( rindler et al . finally , the life cycle of a pgc can be schematically imagined to consist of three stages : ( 1 ) its formation ( which can in turn be further divided into several substages ; see below ) ; ( 2 ) its transition through the cytosol ; and ( 3 ) its docking and fusion with the target membrane ( polishchuk et al . the first of these steps , the formation of the pgc , appears to be the most complex , and it also probably remains the least understood . since the question of the morphogenesis of a pgc is closely intertwined with that of the structure of the organelle from which it originates , the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) , both of these issues will now be discussed in an integrated fashion . the process of pgc morphogenesis has been characterized in detail using video and electron microscopy , as well as with the combination of these techniques ( clem ) . as indicated above , this process comprises the formation , the extrusion and the fission of the export domain from the tgn , thus generating the free carrier ( polishchuk et al . the first step ( the formation of the tubular export domains ) also includes the segregation of the cargo proteins from the golgi resident enzymes . these events appear to be common to the proteins directed towards different post - golgi compartments , such as basolateral plasma membrane ( hirschberg et al . 1998 ; white et al . 2001 ; polishchuk et al . 2003 ) , the apical plasma membrane ( keller et al . 2001 ) and the endosomal  lysosomal system ( puertollano et al . these export domains usually contain tgn markers ; i.e. they are part of the tgn ( polishchuk et al . 2003 ; puertollano et al . 2003 ) . of note , these three post - golgi compartments are the ones that have been best characterized for the pgcs leaving the tgn , with the total number and types of pathways for cargo exit from the tgn at present not known , although there are at least six , and probably more ( rodriguez - boulan et al . 2005 ) .

mironov et al . 1997 ; bonfanti et al . 1998 ; losev et al . 2006 ; matsuura - tokita et al . thus , in a simple version of this scheme , the tgn would result from the final stages of maturation of the golgi cisternae . this would include the partial transformation of this trans - most cisternae into a tubular network , and the various carriers that leave the tgn for their different destinations would all originate form different domains of this tubular network . a more complex and more recent view of the organization at the trans face of the golgi complex comes from studies using electron microscopy tomography of cryofixed , freeze - substituted cells ( ladinsky et al . 1999 , 2002 ) . these studies have indicated that the tgn derives not only from the last trans cisterna , but instead from the three trans - most cisternae ( roth et al . 1985 ) , from where tubules emanate into the trans space of the golgi stacks . remarkably , only the trans - most cisterna exhibits clathrin - coated buds , with the other buds appearing to have different , yet - to - be identified , types of coats ( ladinsky et al . 1999 ) . thus , only the trans - most cisterna would be responsible for the clathrin- and ap-1-dependent trafficking towards the endo - lysosomes , and although all of these three trans - most cisternae of the golgi stacks would serve as the classical tgn , each of them could be specialized in the packaging and export of specific cargo proteins . this might have important functional and mechanistic implications for the proteins sorting and export process . another remarkable tgn feature that has been revealed by these tomographic studies is that these three trans - most cisternae can intercalate with the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) ( ladinsky et al . 1999 , 2002 ) . these have been proposed to have important roles in the transfer of lipids ( through specialized contact sites ) between the er itself and the golgi complex . it will be important to establish whether the morphological discrepancies described above reflect fundamental differences in the organization of the export of cargo in different cell systems . indeed , it is possible that the first model ( the tgn as a network resulting from the tubular disassembly of the last trans - most cisterna ) might actually only represent a special case of the more complete three - trans - cisterna model , and that both of these two different models of tgn may apply , depending on the cell type and the functional conditions . in support of this possibility , it is clear that the tgn can vary significantly in both size and composition across different cell types . for example , cells with a well - developed endo - lysosomal system and without secretory granules exhibit an extensive tubular tgn , while the tubular component of the tgn is reduced in cells that are specialized in regulated secretion ( clermont et al . 1995 ) . this appears to occur in the latter because most of the tgn membranes are used for the packaging of secretory granules , and the tubules only form the thin bridges between the granule precursors . such an organization simplifies the release of the granules , which occurs through the rupture of these tubular elements ( clermont et al . similarly , human fibroblasts have large collagen - containing distensions that are connected to tubular elements in the trans - golgi area ( polishchuk et al . thus , the morphology and size of the tgn apparently depend on the predominant type and amount of cargo protein departing from the golgi complex . the morphology of the tgn depends also on its secretory status . when exit from the tgn is blocked by a lowering of the temperature to 20c in the presence of abundant cargo ( matlin and simons 1983 ) , the volume and surface areas of the tgn increase greatly ( griffiths et al . 1989 ) ; while in the absence of cargo , the 20c block results in all three of the trans - most cisternae producing bulging exit domains ( ladinsky et al . 2002 ) . at physiological temperatures , three - dimensional ( 3d ) analyses of the golgi stacks have revealed well developed , tubular reticular , tgn - like membranes at the trans side of the golgi complex in actively secreting cells ( trucco et al . 2004 ) , while the tgn is nearly absent in quiescent cells ( trucco et al . thus , the tgn is a very dynamic structure , the shape and size of which is potently regulated by the extent of traffic flowing through it . to discover the regulatory mechanisms is an important challenge for the future . another challenge will be to define whether the three - cisterna organization really underlies a functional specialization of these cisternae in the sorting and packaging of different cargo classes , as suggested by the presence of clathrin buds only on the last cisterna of the golgi stack . so far , the lack of immunolabeling studies does not allow determining whether different trans cisternae really do contain different transport proteins . in addition to being an organelle of the biosynthetic pathways , the tgn is involved in endocytic transport routes ( griffiths and simons 1986 ; mellman and simons 1992 ; pavelka et al . 1998 ) . several studies with different cell types showed that the tgn and golgi stacks can contain plasma - membrane constituents and internalized materials ( stoorvogel et al . could well introduce a further level of structural complications , since the recycling endosomes , in particular , reside in the golgi area and are tubular in nature . in conclusion , both the dynamics and the structure of the tgn are variable and incompletely defined , thereby presenting an additional layer of difficulty to our understanding of the biogenesis of the carriers that depart from this organelle . there are two key aspects to the formation of the pgc precursors : their morphogenesis at the tgn ; and the segregation between different types of cargo proteins that are targeted for different destinations , as well as between the golgi - resident proteins , such as the golgi enzymes . regarding pgcs morphogenesis , in principle , the tubular carrier precursors might form through the mechanical pulling force exerted by microtubule - based motors on a flatter , parent , membrane domain ( e.g. , a golgi cisterna ) . this has been shown to be mechanistically possible for both artificial and natural membranes ( roux et al . if this is the case , the pgc precursors would be expected to be essentially simple linear tubular structures ( roux et al . the second possibility is that these precursors are actually formed from the tubular subdomains of the tgn , which are generated prior to docking and extrusion by microtubules . in this case recent studies have provided compelling support in favor of the latter model ( polishchuk et al . first , both free pgcs and their precursors at the tgn comprise complex tubulo - reticular structures , which have often been described as the main component of the tgn in many cell types ( clermont et al . for example , pgcs carrying vsvg show a mostly tubular morphology , and can have a complex structure that even contains clearly visible fenestrae ( polishchuk et al . 2003 ) ; this would be expected of membranes that derive from protrusions of the tgn . indeed , pgc precursors that have been visualized using clem , appear to be comprised of tubular segments that are interconnected with complex branching and fenestrated membranes ; they are also seen to be continuous with the parent membranes of the golgi stack ( polishchuk et al . similarly , carriers containing the apical cargo protein hemagglutinin ( ha ) frequently have a tubular morphology as well as ha - positive domains at the tgn ( puertollano et al . thus structural similarities between pgc precursors and the tgn appear to be a common feature of different types of pgcs . this strongly suggests that pgcs form via the fission of an entire precursor domain ( or a large part thereof ) from the rest of the tgn membranes . thus the question regarding the mechanism by which the originally flat golgi membranes are converted into highly bent , tubular essentially , this can be achieved by one of two mechanisms : either by the action of proteins that can bend these membranes into tubules , in a manner that is possibly similar to that of amphiphysin , endophilin , sorting nexins and others ( antonny 2006 ) , or via the alteration of the lipid composition of these trans - golgi membranes , which can be mediated , in turn , by several processes . for instance , changes in lipid content , and hence membrane curvature , can be modulated via the lipid - metabolizing enzymes that reside at the golgi complex ( for review , see de matteis and godi 2004 ; luini et al . . the transmembrane or inter - organelle transfer of lipids can contribute to the generation of particular lipid environments in the membranes of the tgn . in this respect , it is important to note that numerous contact sites between the er and the trans - cisternae of the golgi complex have been detected by electron microscopy tomography ( ladinsky et al . such contact sites can be explored for lipid transfer between the er and trans - golgi that is mediated by specific lipid - transfer proteins . also , since the cisterna - like morphology of golgi compartments can be stabilized by large polymers of golgi enzymes ( nilsson et al . 1996 ) , the loss of oligomerized golgi enzymes in the trans - golgi should , in principle , favor cisterna - to - tubule transformation of cargo - containing membranes . moreover , this process can be accompanied by the loss of the stacking mechanisms at the trans side of the golgi complex . here , grasp65 and grasp55 are two proteins that have been suggested to be involved in the maintenance of cisterna juxtapositioning , and they are located mainly at the cis and medial golgi , rather than the trans - golgi ( barr et al . so this intercisternal  glue  may be gradually lost as a cisterna progresses towards the trans pole of the golgi complex . this has been confirmed both in mammals and yeast by the observation that the trans - most cisterna frequently peels off from the main golgi stack ( clermont et al . it is possible that more than two or more mechanisms act in synergy to provide this transition from flat golgi cisternae to the tubulo - reticular tgn morphology . in addition to the formation of tubular domains at the exit face of the golgi complex , this is also the level at which cargo proteins that are directed to different post - golgi destinations should be sorted . the classical view in the membrane transport field implies that sorting at the tgn ( as well as throughout the whole secretory pathway ) is driven mainly by the coat - adaptor - protein machinery , which interacts specifically with amino - acid signals of certain transmembrane cargo proteins ; this then provides the mechanical force for budding and fission of transport vesicle ( mellman and warren 2000 ) . this holds true for the endo - lysosome - directed carriers that have been thoroughly characterized . these carriers consist of clusters of clathrin - coated buds that are connected by tubular regions , and thus exhibit a grape - like structure . in contrast , pgcs carrying a cargo like the g - protein of vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsvg ) form in a coat and an ap - independent manner . both pgcs and their precursors do not show -cop or - , - and -adaptins at their membranes ( polishchuk et al . 2003 ) . other adaptors , such as the ggas , are excluded from vsvg carriers as well ( puertollano et al . similarly , coats and adaptors have also never been detected on pgcs that are carrying proteins to the apical surface in polarized cells ( kreitzer et al . thus , these carriers should form either by virtue of some still - unknown adaptors that can not yet be visualized by electron microscopy , or by their association with specific lipid microdomains that are involved in sorting ( schuck and simons 2004 ) . this might be the case for proteins directed to the apical surface in polarized epithelial cells , the concentration of which at the tgn appear to be through their partition into cholesterol- and sphingolipid - rich membrane domains that are known as  rafts  ( schuck and simons 2004 ) . observations in living cells have revealed that the fission of pgcs frequently coincides with mechanical pulling of carrier precursor from the tgn along microtubules . apparently , the pulling force which the molecular motors such as kinesin ( see below ) can apply to the tgn membranes is important to facilitate the extension of pgc precursors from the golgi body and for the later fission of the pgc ( kreitzer et al . 2003 ) . in cell - free systems , the addition of kinesin to golgi membranes ( and even to liposomes ) together with microtubules induces the formation of tubule - like membranes that are similar to pgc precursors ( roux et al . 2002 ) , while a block of kinesin function by microinjection of an inhibitory antibody ( kreitzer et al . 2000 ) or expression of the headless kinesin mutant ( nakata and hirokawa 2003 ) prevent pgc formation from the golgi complex . kinesin has been seen to be associated with the tip of pgc precursors , although it can also attach to other points along the pgc precursor membrane ( polishchuk et al . the movement of kinesins along microtubules can then create tension within the pgc precursor that will facilitate the fission process . indeed , based on in vitro data , membranes under tension have recently been proposed to have an important role in fission ( roux et al . however , pgcs can also form when microtubules have been destroyed by nocodozole treatment ; in this case , the pulling force to create membrane tension in fission - prone regions might be provided by actin motors ( warner et al . live cell imaging and clem have also shown that fission does not take place randomly along the membranes of pgc precursors . in this case , which regions of a pgc precursor can be defined as prone to fission ? our data suggest that fission usually takes place at the thinnest parts of the pgc precursor ( fig . 2a ) , which at the electron microscopy level corresponding to thin tubular segments of membranes ( polishchuk et al . in contrast , fission does not take place at the tgn regions with a complex morphology ( i.e. , in those containing tubular networks and branching tubules , or in thick vacuolar regions ) . obviously , the precise points of fission will define not only the compositions of the pgc carriers , but also their morphology . if fission occurs close to the tip of the tgn tubule , a carrier will be smaller in size . in contrast , larger pgcs can form by cleavage at the base of the pgc precursors ( fig . similarly , endosome - directed pgcs can apparently detach from the tgn as simple cargo - containing vesicles if the fission occurs at the neck of the clathrin - coated buds ( fig . however , many clathrin - positive pgcs have a grape - like morphology ( tubule with several buds ) , suggesting that entire chunks of tgn membranes containing 23 clathrin - coated buds can be cleaved from the golgi complex ( polishchuk et al . the fission ( red line ) of the carriers occurs at the thinnest parts of the pgc precursor , which correspond to thin tubular segments of the tgn membrane at the electron microscopy level . in contrast , fission does not take place at the tgn regions with a complex morphology ( i.e. , containing tubular networks and fenestrae , or in thick vacuolar regions ) . if fission occurs close to the tip of a pgc precursor , the carrier will be smaller in size ( 1 ) . in contrast , larger pgcs can be formed by cleavage at the bottom of a pgc precursor ( 2 ) . b pgcs directed to endosomes detach from the tgn as simple clathrin - coated vesicles if fission ( red line ) occur at the neck of the clathrin - coated bud ( 1 ) . alternatively , entire chunks of the tgn membrane containing 2 - 3 clathrin - coated buds can be cleaved from the golgi complex fission of post - golgi transport carriers . the fission ( red line ) of the carriers occurs at the thinnest parts of the pgc precursor , which correspond to thin tubular segments of the tgn membrane at the electron microscopy level . in contrast , fission does not take place at the tgn regions with a complex morphology ( i.e. , containing tubular networks and fenestrae , or in thick vacuolar regions ) . if fission occurs close to the tip of a pgc precursor , the carrier will be smaller in size ( 1 ) . in contrast , larger pgcs can be formed by cleavage at the bottom of a pgc precursor ( 2 ) . b pgcs directed to endosomes detach from the tgn as simple clathrin - coated vesicles if fission ( red line ) occur at the neck of the clathrin - coated bud ( 1 ) . alternatively , entire chunks of the tgn membrane containing 2 - 3 clathrin - coated buds can be cleaved from the golgi complex another factor that might be important for pgc shaping is the type of cargo that is embedded in the pgc . for example , procollagen - i usually forms quite large aggregates that are visible within 300400-nm - diameter membrane distensions of the golgi membranes . as a consequence , similar distensions have been detected in most collagen - containing pgcs ( polishchuk et al . 2003 ; canty et al . different members of the kinesin superfamily ( kamal et al . 2000 ; nakata and hirokawa 2003 ; teng et al . 1999 ) , have been shown to drive post - golgi transport of specific cargo to various destinations . this high fidelity of cargo selection by molecular motors at the tgn and their further delivery to the correct surface or intracellular domain may be regulated by interactions of motor protein directly with the cargo ( kamal et al . 2000 ; teng et al . 2005 ) or with components of the sorting machinery at the tgn ( nakagawa et al . 2000 ) . as an example , transport of ha and annexin 13b to the apical surface in epithelial cells relies on raft - associated motor kifc3 ( noda et al . kif13a operates in the other post - golgi route that is used for the transport of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor ( nakagawa et al . 2000 ) . a number of neuronal proteins , including bapp , gap43 and vamp-2 , require kif5 for their correct targeting ( nakata and hirokawa 2003 ) , while the microtubule minus - end - directed motor dynein has been shown to support rhodopsin transport in rod photoreceptors ( tai et al . the simplest would use a direct interaction between the motor and a specific domain of a cargo protein , as is seen for the dynein light chain and the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin ( tai et al . alternatively , adaptor proteins could serve as a bridge between a motor and its cargo . for example , kif13a transports the mannose-6-phosphate receptor through its interaction with the ap-1 complex ( nakagawa et al . 2000 ) . finally , both motor and cargo could associate with the same specific lipid microdomain , as for instance , for kifc3 and the apically targeted annexin xiiib . another issue that needs to be addressed is whether any of these sorting processes take place in the pgcs while they are moving toward their acceptor compartment . this happens , for example , with the maturation of secretory granules when the mannose-6-phosphate receptor is concentrated and sorted from the secretory granules by clathrin - coated vesicles ( klumperman et al . so several strategies have been used to determine whether similar sorting events happen with pgcs . mature exocytic carriers can be arrested before their fusion with the plasma membrane either by microinjection of an anti - nsf antibody or by treatment with tannic acid ( which fixes the plasma membrane but does not penetrate inside the cell ) . in contrast to secretory granules , the comparison of mature and newly formed pgcs did not reveal significant changes in either their ultrastructure or their composition ( polishchuk et al . similarly , mature golgi - to - endosome carriers were accumulated in cells upon endosome inactivation . however , they did not show any significant transformation , except for a very moderate reduction in the area covered by clathrin ( polishchuk et al . live - cell imaging of subconfluent mdck cells has shown that pcgs that initially contained both a basolateral marker ( vsvg - cfp ) and an apical marker ( gpi - yfp ) did not sort out either of these cargoes into any separate structures , and instead delivered both of the proteins to the plasma membrane ( polishchuk et al . gpi - gfp was then sorted from the basolateral surface to the apical membrane through transcytosis ( polishchuk et al . the partitioning of two proteins from a common pgc into separate carriers has also been reported ( jacob and naim 2001 ) . this suggests that sorting from the pgc may exist , but that it should depend on the nature of the cargo proteins being transported . the complexity of sorting events in the post - golgi space appears to be even worse since the discovery that certain cargoes may pass through the endosomal compartments before their arrival at the plasma membrane . sporadic reports in the past have suggested that some secretory proteins do not move from the golgi complex directly to the plasma membrane , but instead pass through an endocytic intermediate on their way to the cell surface ( leitinger et al . this indirect  through - endosome  delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane might be also facilitated by the intimate association of tgn membranes with number of endocytic compartments in the perinuclear area of the cell ( marsh et al . the list of the proteins using this pathway has been recently updated , and it has now been shown that in mdck epithelial cells , vsvg , the ldl receptor and e - cadherin can be detected in the endosomes before their exit to the plasma membrane ( ang et al . 2004 ; lock and stow 2005 ) . the first is whether this transport route is ubiquitous ( i.e. , does it exist in different cells ? ) . the second question is whether different cargoes move through the same endosomal compartment on their way to the cell surface in epithelial cells ? a number of proteins ( such as vsvg and the ldl receptor ) have been reported to use a rab8-positive sub - population of endosomes as an intermediate station on their way to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells ( ang et al . these proteins require the ap-1b adaptor complex to be properly sorted from these rab8 endosomes towards the basolateral surface domain ( ang et al . 2003 ) . other cargoes ( such as e - cadherin , for example ) move to the plasma membrane through a rab11 endocytic compartment ( lock and stow 2005 ) . it remains to be determined , however , whether there is any cross - talk between these rab8- and rab11-dependent routes . this possibility apparently exists , since rab8 and rab11 endosomes are both accessible to transferrin ( ang et al . finally it is important to clarify as to what extent this through - endosome transport route is used by different cargo proteins in epithelial cells . this issue has been partially addressed by the silencing of the 1b subunit of the ap-1b adaptor complex , which resides at the endosomes and is required for the correct delivery of many basolateral proteins . the use of rna interference has revealed , however , that a number of cargoes ( such as transferrin and fc receptors , for example ) can be targeted correctly even in the absence of ap-1b , which suggests that these proteins can move directly from the golgi complex to the basolateral surface without crossing the endocytic routes ( gravotta et al . the existence of more than one basolateral pathway has also been supported by the observation that transport of different basolateral proteins can be selectively regulated by different pkd isoforms ( yeaman et al . thus , further efforts need to be made to understand to what extent an endocytic post - golgi compartment is involved in the sorting and transport events of cell - surface proteins . the extensive characterization of pgc morphology by video and electron microscopy has provided a framework for the positioning of the molecular machineries in the morpho - functional maps of various trafficking segments . at the same time , many molecular players in tgn - to - plasma membrane transport have been identified . the attribution of each of the molecular components to each of the pathways is probably now the main challenge . we believe that the development of specific assays will significantly assist in the achieving of this objective . video microscopy of gfp - tagged cargo proteins has allowed us to evaluate the process of pgc formation , as well as the speed and directionality of pgc movement through the cytosol . 2006 ) or horse - radish - peroxidase - based endosome immobilization ( ang et al . these conditions allow us to trap mature pgcs and to compare their compositions to newly formed carriers and the tgn membranes . moreover , preferential sites of pgc docking and fusion can also be easily identified in this way . the combination of these experimental approaches with specific molecular inhibitors now allows us to attribute a protein of interest to one of the steps in post - golgi transport .","the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) is one of the main , if not the main , sorting stations in the process of intracellular protein trafficking . 
 it is therefore of central importance to understand how the key players in the tgn - based sorting and delivery process , the post - golgi carriers ( pgcs ) , form and function . over the last few years 
 , modern morphological approaches have generated new insights into the questions of pgc biogenesis , structure and dynamics . 
 here , we present a view by which the  lifecycle  of a pgc consists of several distinct stages : the formation of tgn tubular export domains ( where different cargoes are segregated from each other and from the golgi enzymes ) ; the docking of these tubular domains onto molecular motors and their extrusion towards the cell periphery along microtubules ; the fission of the forming pgc from the donor membrane ; and the delivery of the newly formed pgc to its specific acceptor organelle .

"staghorn calculi are branched calculi that fill the entire or part of the renal pelvis and extend into the renal calices . if untreated or inadequately treated , they may lead to various complications such as deterioration of renal function and risk of developing urosepsis . in addition , chronic irritation , inflammation and infection from these stones can cause squamous metaplasia of the renal pelvis epithelium that may progress to squamous cell carcinoma . squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis is a rare tumor , with a prevalence of < 1% of urinary tract neoplasms . here we demonstrate an older woman with staghorn calculi presenting with severe hypercalcemia caused by squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis . a 79-year - old female presented with gradual deterioration of mental status for 1 month . for 2 months prior to admission , she had had intermittent right upper abdominal pain , vomiting , constipation , anorexia and significant weight loss . her medical conditions were hypertension and dyslipidemia , and she was receiving treatment with amlodipine and simvastatin . kidney , ureter and bladder ( kub ) x - ray visualized a large right staghorn stone ( fig . 1a ) , and a retrograde pyelogram showed right staghorn renal calculi with partial obstruction and left middle ureter stricture ( fig . a diuretic renal scan was interpreted as a nonfunctioning right kidney and fair renal function of the left kidney . serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 52 mg / dl ( reference range 718 ) and 6.8 mg / dl ( reference range 0.671.17 ) , respectively . she was rehydrated with normal saline and then referred to our hospital for relief of left ureteric obstruction . on examination , the patient appeared lethargic and dehydrated . her blood pressure was 160/87 mm hg and her pulse rate was 93 beats / min . two lymph nodes , 0.7 and 1 cm in diameter , were palpated in the left supraclavicular area . she had nonpitting edema on both legs that was more pronounced on the right leg with the presence of homan 's sign . urinary examination showed a ph of 5 , white blood cells of 12/high - power field and red blood cells of 01 cells / high - power field . furthermore , blood chemistries revealed serum total calcium of 14.8 mg / dl ( reference range 8.510.1 ) , serum phosphorus of 3 mg / dl ( reference range 2.54.9 ) and serum creatinine of 2 mg / dl ( reference range 0.671.17 ) . serum intact parathyroid hormone ( pth ) was investigated and found to be 11.5 pg / ml ( reference range 1565 ) . in the settings of old age , weight loss and deep vein thrombosis , humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy was mostly suspected . unfortunately , we could not confirm the diagnosis with pth - related protein ( pth - rp ) due to test unavailability in our country . renal ultrasound visualized large right staghorn calculi and moderate left hydronephrosis with proximal hydroureter ( fig . doppler ultrasound showed acute extensive deep vein thrombosis of both legs along the external iliac vein , the common femoral vein , the proximal deep femoral vein to the popliteal vein . there was minimal right pleural effusion on chest x - ray , with no abnormal pulmonary nodules . in searching for the primary site of malignancy , histopathology was compatible with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma . computed tomography of the chest and abdomen showed an infiltrative tumor with extensive involvement of the right kidney , the right pelvocalyceal system , the right adrenal gland , the right lobe of the liver and the adjacent right hemidiaphragm and psoas muscle ( fig . there were inferior vena cava invasion and multiple metastases in both hepatic lobes and intra - abdominal lymph nodes . the final diagnosis was advanced - stage squamous cell carcinoma of the right renal pelvis . to rescue left kidney function , a left retrograde pyelogram with double j stent after restoration of volume status , serum creatinine levels decreased from 2.0 to 1.7 mg / dl . four days later , serum calcium level subsided to 10.16 mg / dl . it was decided that long - term therapy would be the best supportive care . the patient was discharged to a primary care hospital and passed away 1 month later . the tumor generally presents with abrupt onset , severe symptoms and high serum calcium concentration of > 14 mg / dl . even though various cells in the body have the potential to produce pth - rp , tumors that commonly produce pth - rp include squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck , esophagus , cervix and lung ; adenocarcinomas of the breast and ovary and renal cell carcinoma . the definite diagnosis can be confirmed by detection of high serum pth - rp , but this is not necessary for diagnosis in most situations . squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis is a very rare tumor , accounting for only 0.58.0% of malignant renal tumors [ 5 , 6 ] . the coexistence of renal calculi has been reported in 87100% of cases [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] . it has also been associated with tuberculosis , chronic pyelonephritis , radiation therapy , chronic rejection in a transplanted kidney , analgesic abuse with phenacetin , immunosuppression with azathioprine and previous percutaneous nephrolithotomy . staghorn calculi are usually composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate ( struvite ) and/or calcium carbonate apatite . cystine or uric acid mixed with other components can also grow in a staghorn configuration . infection stones because of the strong relation with urinary tract infection caused by urease - producing gram - negative bacteria , e.g. proteus , morganella and providencia spp . however , recent data found that 55% of cases with staghorn calculi were from metabolic stones , in particular of calcium phosphate composition . moreover , the most common component of staghorn calculi in patients in southern thailand was uric acid . left untreated , staghorn calculi may cause life - threatening sepsis and renal function impairment . over time , staghorn stones cause squamous metaplasia and dysplasia of the uroepithelium . therefore , most patients should require treatment of staghorn stones . the treatment options are medical therapy , surgery , percutaneous nephrolithotomy and shock wave lithotripsy . analysis of the composition of the stone and metabolic evaluation are essential for preventing recurrence [ 13 , 14 ] . increased fluid intake to achieve a urine output of > 2.5 l / day will decrease the risk of urinary supersaturation . early detection of the tumor by ultrasound would be difficult because the tumor appears as a nonspecific finding , such as a solid mass , calcification or hydronephrosis . as a result , a computed tomography scan may be an option for cancer detection , with better yield for diagnosis . findings of filling defect in the collecting system , delayed appearance of pyelogram or renal parenchymal thickening should be definitely considered as renal tumor . in conclusion , humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy mediated by pth - rp is an uncommon feature of the tumor . removal of the staghorn stone is necessary to eliminate infection and prevent squamous metaplasia of the renal epithelium . written informed consent was obtained from the next of kin for publication of this case report and the accompanying images . a copy of the written consent is available for review by the editor of this journal .","we report on a 79-year - old woman with staghorn calculi who presented with severe hypercalcemia . she was later found to have humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy caused by a rare tumor , squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis . 
 chronic irritation , infection and inflammation from staghorn stones cause squamous metaplasia , leading to squamous cell carcinoma of the renal collecting system . 
 the prognosis is very poor , with a 5-year survival rate of < 10% . 
 this case highlights the importance of awareness of a very rare and aggressive carcinoma in a patient with long - standing nephrolithiasis .",132
"graft versus host disease refers to the inflammatory and/or fibrosing manifestations that may arise at various times after transplantation of any organ containing lymphoid cells , which react against and damage tissues in the immunocompromised host . the gvhd syndrome has traditionally been subdivided into two syndromes : acute gvhd and chronic gvhd . graft versus host reaction ( gvhr ) is the expression of gvhd in a specific organ . transfusion - associated ( ta ) gvhd is a rare but probably underdiagnosed disorder , which , although usually fatal , may evolve into chronic graft - versus - host disease . a 55-year - old female presented with complaints of increased pigmentation all over body since 4 years . the pigmentation initially started over right thigh and later spread to involve the entire body within few months . the patient gave history of receiving 2 units of cross - matched , unrelated , compatible blood for low hemoglobin ( 7.5 g % ) about 6 months prior to the onset of pigmentation . the patient had attained menopause about 15 years back with no history of irregular menses or menorrhagia previously . palms and soles showed reticular hyperpigmentation with atrophic skin over digits [ figures 1a , 1b and 2 ] . ( b ) : reticulate hyperpigmentation present all over the body  anterior aspect reticulate hyperpigmentation , atrophic skin over palms oral cavity showed reticular hyperpigmentation over buccal mucosa [ figure 3 ] . hair over the scalp was sparse and lateral eyebrows were lost [ figure 4 ] . nails showed longitudinal ridging , distal niche , pterygium formation and atrophic changes [ figure 5 ] . reticulate hyperpigmentation over buccal mucosa , lips non - scarring diffuse alopecia over scalp , reticulate hyperpigmentation over the face distal niche , longitudinal ridging and pterygium over finger nails dermatoscopic study of pigmentation showed reticular pattern with dark brown - black pigment granules concentrating more at the corners of the network . based on history and clinical features , differential diagnoses of lichen planus pigmentosus , connective tissue disease and chronic graft versus host disease were considered and relevant investigations were done . investigations showed microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin of 9.5 g% , raised esr ( 50 mm / hr ) , reactive crp with negative ana and ra factor . her liver function tests , renal function tests , random blood sugar , serum calcium , uric acid , and thyroid profile were within normal limits . histopathological examination showed thick basket weave and laminated orthokeratotic stratum corneum , flattened epidermis , focal hypergranulosis , basal cell vacuolization , individual necrotic keratinocytes at dermoepidermal junction and thick , innumerable melanophages with sparse lymphocytic infiltrate in widened papillary dermis [ figures 6 and 7 ] . histopathology  10 ( h and e )  thick basket weave , laminated orthokeratotic stratum corneum , flattened epidermis , focal hypergranulosis , basal cell vacuolization , individual necrotic keratinocytes at dermoepidermal junction and thick , innumerable melanophages with sparse lymphocytic infiltrate in widened papillary dermis histopathology  40 ( h and e )  prominent orthokeratosis , individual necrotic keratinocytes , basal cell vacuolization in the background of history of blood transfusion , onset of symptoms after 6 months of blood transfusion , clinical features and histopathologic features , a diagnosis of lichenoid variant of chronic cutaneous graft versus host reaction was made . the patient was started on oral prednisolone 40 mg od and azathioprine 50 mg od , topical emollients and advised regarding photoprotection . however , the patient failed to follow up after starting treatment . gvhd occurs when immunocompetent t cells from a donor recognize and react against  foreign  tissue antigens in an immunocompromised host . it may be the result of autoreactive t cells that escape negative selection in the thymus which has been damaged by preconditioning treatment , acute gvhd and/or age - related atrophy . the th2 immune responses of these donor - derived cd4 + t cells then stimulate host b cells to synthesize autoantibodies . in addition , ifn production by activated t cells induces hla - dr expression on keratinocytes , making them targets for a similar reaction . it is commonly observed after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , ( regularly used in the management of leukemias , lymphoma , immunodeficiency and inborn errors of metabolism ) , but ta gvhd is only rarely reported . ta gvhd is recognized to occur following transfusion of blood , after materno fetal transfer of lymphoid cells , and peripheral blood stem cell transfer . although early reports of ta gvhd were recognized in immunocompromised hosts , more recent cases have been documented in immunocompetent transfusion recipients . it has been documented after transfusion of unirradiated blood components , whole blood , fresh ( nonfrozen ) plasma , red blood cells , and platelets . transfusions from donors homozygous for an hla haplotype to a recipient sharing this haplotype may predispose to ta gvhd in immunocompetent patient . there is an extremely high fatality rate for established acute ta gvhd , reaching 90% in some reports . because of the very high early mortality , chronic gvhd secondary to blood transfusion has only rarely been reported . it may appear de novo , or following acute gvhd , in continuity or after a variable symptom - free period . it is usually a multisystem disease ; localized disease also occurs , in which individual organs ( usually skin or liver ) are affected . the severity of individual organ involvement does not correlate well with the overall survival ; the patient 's functional performance is a better indicator of survival . it can develop spontaneously or be triggered by several events , notably uv irradiation , physical trauma , zoster , or even borrelia infections . lichenoid lesions occur early , typically on periorbital skin , ears , palms , and soles . a slowly progressive erythematous rash on the face , palms and soles becomes lichenoid , with changes resembling lichen planus in many sites . thinning of the nails , pterygium formation , phimosis , or vaginal strictures may also develop . oral involvement is very common , with areas of erythema and atrophy , lichenoid or hyperkeratotic plaques , ulceration , and atrophic glossitis . reticulate patchy hyperpigmentation and , less commonly , hypopigmentation , poikiloderma , vitiligo ( which may be total ) , erythema , atrophy , alopecia , multiple follicular papules , deep ulcerations of the buttocks and legs , and dystrophic nail changes are other features . both acute and chronic gvhd cause an interface dermatitis which may be a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate or predominantly vacuolar damage of basal cells . satellitosis  is particularly suggestive of gvhd , although no single histological feature is pathognomonic . the lichenoid lesions are similar to acute gvhd lesions , with a superficial dermal lymphocytic infiltrate , moderate exocytosis , and a variable degree of keratinocyte necrosis . igm may occur at the dermal  epidermal junction , with granular deposits of igm , iga and c3 in the walls of dermal vessels . corticosteroids are the first choice for the treatment of chronic gvhd , but approximately 30% of patients require secondary systemic treatment . the lichenoid variant is usually well - controlled with a combination of corticosteroids and cyclosporine . cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , pentostatin , or high - dose thalidomide and hydroxychloroquine may be used if the first - line therapy fails . puva photochemotherapy and narrow - band uvb phototherapy are other options for skin involvement , while extracorporeal photochemotherapy may improve cutaneous as well as systemic involvement . granulocyte colony - stimulating factor , antilymphocyte globulin , tacrolimus , biological therapies , including etanercept , and particularly rituximab , may be helpful for steroid - resistant disease . patients with the lichenoid type of eruption have a worse prognosis , with 80% mortality at 10 years . prevention includes gamma irradiation of the lymphocyte - containing blood products and the use of third- or fourth - generation leukoreduction filters , although not 100% efficacious . graft versus host disease can be induced when blood products containing viable lymphocytes engraft in recipients after transfusion . we hereby report a case of graft versus host disease occurring 6 months post blood transfusion . the disease affected skin , mucosa , hair and nails of the patient with no systemic symptoms and histology was suggestive of lichenoid gvhd . chronic lichenoid gvhd , a disease usually seen post solid organ transplantation can rarely occur post blood transfusion.it can be limited only to skin , mucosa , nail and hair , without any systemic involvement and not causing much of functional impairment . chronic lichenoid gvhd , a disease usually seen post solid organ transplantation can rarely occur post blood transfusion . it can be limited only to skin , mucosa , nail and hair , without any systemic involvement and not causing much of functional impairment .","chronic graft versus host disease ( gvhd ) is a less frequently seen disease that occurs post solid organ or bone marrow transplantation . chronic gvhd occurring post blood transfusion is an even more uncommon disease . 
 it can present either as a lichenoid disease or as a sclerodermatous disease involving multiple systems . in this article 
 , we report a case of chronic graft versus host reaction occurring in skin secondary to blood transfusion .",89
"the current research on human diseases primarily focuses on the molecular , microbiological , immunological , and pathological influences . the mechanical basis of disease is now often being explored to decipher any direct contributions toward the physiological response [ 1 , 2 ] . in functionally loaded tissues such as cartilage and bone , cells ( chondrocytes and osteocytes ) experience multiaxial forces ( hydrostatic , compressive , tensile , and shear ) , which play a significant role in modulating the biological function through maintenance of the phenotype and production of a neotissue . conversely , abnormal mechanical forces ( either static or dynamic ) can lead to altered cell behavior resulting in pathological matrix synthesis , increased catabolic activity ( degradation ) , and ultimately osteoarthritis or osteoporosis ( apoptosis ) . our previous investigations have indicated that chondrocytes and likely other cell types respond to their stress - strain environments in a temporal and spatial manner . it has also just been shown that individual cellular mechanical properties may indicate the regenerative potential of mesenchymal stem cells . investigations of the biomechanics at the cellular level have also identified the biomarkers of disease . cytoskeletal stiffness of metastatic cancer cells was reported as more than 70% softer than the benign cells that line the body cavity in patients with suspected lung , breast , and pancreatic cancer . these approaches highlight the utility of single - cell biomechanics as a critical component of advancing microscale therapeutics . advancements in laser technology and microfluidics now allow the use of optical tweezers or traps and fluid mechanics to manipulate isolated single cells [ 8 , 9 ] . isolated loads can be applied experimentally to single cells in culture to quantify cellular and cytoskeletal biomechanics . one can then apply forces and displacements as small as pico - newtons and nanometers , respectively [ 1012 ] . the local microenvironment can therefore be precisely manipulated to facilitate biomechanical test sequences on individual biological cells and molecular structures .   in order to explore the connection between external mechanical stimulation and cellular regeneration or degeneration , we developed a three - dimensional , multiphysics computational model to fully characterize a unique micromechanical environment . the applied stress state within our custom - fabricated optical and hydrodynamic ( optohydrodynamic ) trap have been mathematically developed from the fundamental equations describing microfluidic creeping flows past a suspended sphere . the objective described in the following paper is to explore the full - field cellular strain response to a range of applied stresses and cellular moduli . the described computational framework will now allow us to develop more realistic cellular models , whose intracellular structures are distinctly identified . living non - adhered , suspended osteoblasts , chondrocytes , fibroblasts , and myoblasts have recently been isolated and mechanically manipulated [ 12 , 16 ] . primary cultures of chondrogenic and osteogenic tissues were generated directly from rat long bones , while muscle cells were acquired from the mouse - derived myoblast c2c12 cell line ( atcc , crl-1772 , manassas , va , usa ) . all cells were tested at room temperature experiments ( ~20.5c ) in a flow media consisting of a physiological buffer resulting in a media viscosity of ~1  mpa  s. this single cell biomechanical manipulation was made available by combining optical trapping with microfluidics to create the optohydrodynamic trap . this work was facilitated by an instrument , which integrates two laser - based techniques for the mechanical characterization of cellular and biomolecular structures [ 8 , 12 ] . the optical tweezers or the trap component of the device utilizes an infrared laser (  = 1,064  nm ) to suspend micron - sized objects with nanometer position control and pico - newton constraining forces . in the mie regime , where objects are larger in dimension than the wavelength of the trapping laser ( here biological cells ) , a ray optics description indicates the transfer of refracted light and the associated momentum into trapping forces ( figure 1 ) . micron - particle image velocimetry can be engaged by incorporating two frequency - doubled lasers (  = 532  nm ) aligned through the same optical path as the ot for full - field flow velocity characterization . however , the nanoparticles associated with velocity imaging have proven deleterious to cellular health , but provide useful experimental validation of flows around synthetic micron - sized particles .   the hydrodynamic component of this approach is facilitated through a microfluidic chip design configured in the form of a cross - junction channel ( figure 2 ) . this geometry creates an extensional flow environment and a stagnation point at the channel 's geometric center . cells are positioned at the centroid with the optical trap and manipulated with microfluidics , thus creating the optohydrodynamic trap . the cell experiences a total drag force equal to zero , confirmed by integrating the stress tensor as defined by the normal ( form drag ) and shear ( friction drag ) stresses ( figure 3 ) . this reflects the mechanical stability or the saddle - point nature of the optohydrodynamic trap . previous studies describe chip fabrication in detail including the control of the gravity - driven flow initially associated with microfluidic manipulation . the two- and three - dimensional stress states were previously developed as applied to the surface of a nonrotating spheroid cell of radius a , within the optohydrodynamic trap [ 2 , 12 , 14 , 15 ] . briefly , the full - field fluid velocity vector u was constructed from the constitutive equations describing a non - rotating sphere suspended in a general linear flow with viscosity  and pressure distribution p . in the polar - spherical components ( r-- magnitudes and er - e-e vectors ) , the generalized flow field produces the individual velocity components : 
 ( 1)u = u(ra52(ar)2 + 32(ar)4)sin2cos2er+u(ra(ar)4)sincoscos2e+u(ra(ar)4)sincos2e 
 including the pressure distribution 
 ( 2)p = p5ua(ar)3sin2cos2. the velocity gradients can be converted into the applied fluid stresses by applying the constitutive equation for an incompressible , newtonian fluid : 
 ( 3)t=pi+2e , 
 where t is the stress tensor and i is the identity matrix associated with the local isotropic ( hydrostatic ) pressure distribution p. the strain rate tensor e can be characterized by the flow velocity gradient tensor and its transpose : 
 ( 4)e=(12)[u+ut ] . by incorporating the velocity and pressure fields into the gradient analysis and then in turn into the constitutive equation , the fluidic stress tensor can be fully defined as 
 ( 5)trr=p+ua(2 + 15(ar)312(ar)5)sin2cos2er , tr=ua(25(ar)3 + 8(ar)5)sincoscos2e,tr=ua(25(ar)3 + 8(ar)5)sinsin2e. defining the stress tensor at the cellular surface , r = a , produces the volumetric fluidic stress state applied to the cell : 
 ( 6)tr = ter=rrer+re+re , 
 where the full - field stress state can then be defined in terms of distinct normal , rr , and shear , r and r , stress components , respectively , in polar spherical coordinates : 
 ( 7)rr=p+5uasin2cos2,r=5uasincoscos2,r=5uasinsin2. 
 a three - dimensional presentation of the stresses was developed ( matlab , mathworks , inc . , natick , ma ) for demonstration of the site - specific nature of the stress distributions ( figure 4 ) . the six deviatoric stresses were combined as an effective stress value , eff , as a means to model the three - dimensional stress state : 
 ( 8)eff=12[(xy)2+(yz)2+(zx)2  + 6(xy2+yz2+zx2)]1/2 . 
 here , the maximum polar coordinate derived stresses were converted to the cartesian coordinate stresses such that the maximum normal stresses are located along the x - y - z axes and the maximum shear stresses are defined along the 45 orientation off - axis locations . volumetric strain , e , based on the strain invariants , ii , was defined to encompass the full - field deformation response of the cell within the multiaxial fluidic loading environment and does not apply the small - displacement theory assumption . the cartesian axes associated with the maximum normal strains were determined from a mohr 's circle analysis [ 12 , 20 ] : 
 ( 9)e = i1+i2+i3=x+y+z+xy+yz+zx+xyz .   the experimental approach described earlier is a planar - wise measurement technique ; thus the optical depth strain value , z , can be determined through a transposition of the planar loading scenario , again through a mohr 's circle analysis : 
 ( 10)z=1(x+y ) . 
 however , in this modeling presentation here , the full - field stress state and the corresponding strains are fully characterized . the optohydrodynamic deviatoric stress state was applied to an isotropic , homogenous biological cell ( 20  m in diameter ) within a multiphysics computational environment ( comsol v4.0 , palo alto , ca , usa ) in order to determine the individual principal strains and in turn the volumetric strains . in this work , we continue to examine the cellular biomechanics induced within a controlled micromechanical environment . three - dimensional cellular strains were computationally modeled in silico with multiphysics software applying the analytically defined stress state ( figure 5 ) . volumetric stress and strain relationships indicated both the nonlinear response of the spherical cellular structure as well as the logarithmic increase in strain with subsequently softer cellular moduli ( figure 6 ) . this relationship is further explored when examining the direct relationship of strain with elastic moduli ( figure 7 ) . the extreme strain response induced in diseased cells indicates their further vulnerability when passively or actively resisting applied stresses . we explored the full - field cellular strain response to a range of applied hydrodynamic stresses and cellular moduli , representing various degrees of functional loading and health / disease , respectively . the computational framework now allows us to develop more realistic cellular models with intracellular and membranous structures , distinct in spatial , elastic , and active transport characteristics . the mechanical properties of a single cell are often formulated using either macroscopic or microscopic approaches . macroscopic approaches , as partially described in this work , homogenize every cellular component to produce an isotropic or anisotropic yet homogeneous continuum model so that the mechanical properties of cells can be formulated using temporal and spatially continuous partial differential equations . future efforts will incorporate a more microscopic approach , which regards the cell as a biocomposite material consisting of randomly or uniformly spaced anisotropic reinforcement cytoskeletal materials within an isotropic medium . the microscopic approach generally obtains the biomechanical response of a single cell by applying the mechanical boundary conditions at the individual fiber and matrix level , scaling  up  to the cellular level . microscopic approaches often provide much more detail into the subtle interaction between the cytoskeletal fibers and matrix , which potentially leads to a more accurate model of the cellular behavior , such as characterizing the irreversible deformation of the cellular skeleton . unfortunately , refined microscopic models suffer from inhibitory computational and storage costs [ 26 , 27 ] . when interpreting the potential geometric changes in cellular shape associated with mechanical loading , the cell may experience some interesting membrane transitions triggering unique biologic cues . under suspension and hydrostatic loading , the cell 's volume ( v ) can be defined as a sphere , v = 3/4abc , with radii a = b = c. as seen here during the hydrodynamic extensional loading state , the isotropic , homogenous cell model deformed into a scalene ellipsoid ( a  b  c ) with equal and opposite tensile and compressive strains in the horizontal plane . however , with the future inclusion of intracellular structures and organelles as well as nonlinear elastic properties assigned to the membrane and cytoskeleton , cellular models may also deform into either an oblate spheroid ( formed when an ellipse is rotated about its minor axis , a = b > c ) or a prolate spheroid ( formed when an ellipse is rotated about its major axis , a = b < c ) . the resulting shape here replicated a scalene ellipsoid likely due to different maximum stresses applied in the three orthogonal axes . ongoing experiments and modeling will continue to explore multiaxial single - cell biomechanics as well as the biologic triggers associated with geometric shape - shifting . the described multiphysics computational framework will facilitate more realistic cytoskeletal model interpretations , whose intracellular structures can be distinctly defined , including the cellular membrane substructures , nucleus , and organelles . future results will provide mathematical outcomes supporting the ongoing investigations in tissue and cellular engineering .","controlled external chemomechanical stimuli have been shown to influence cellular and tissue regeneration / degeneration , especially with regards to distinct disease sequelae or health maintenance . 
 recently , a unique three - dimensional stress state was mathematically derived to describe the experimental stresses applied to isolated living cells suspended in an optohydrodynamic trap ( optical tweezers combined with microfluidics ) . 
 these formulae were previously developed in two and three dimensions from the fundamental equations describing creeping flows past a suspended sphere . 
 the objective of the current study is to determine the full - field cellular strain response due to the applied three - dimensional stress environment through a multiphysics computational simulation . in this investigation , 
 the multiscale cytoskeletal structures are modeled as homogeneous , isotropic , and linearly elastic . 
 the resulting computational biophysics can be directly compared with experimental strain measurements , other modeling interpretations of cellular mechanics including the liquid drop theory , and biokinetic models of biomolecule dynamics . 
 the described multiphysics computational framework will facilitate more realistic cytoskeletal model interpretations , whose intracellular structures can be distinctly defined , including the cellular membrane substructures , nucleus , and organelles .",237
"peripancreatic fluid collections ( pfcs ) can develop secondary to either fluid leakage or liquefaction of pancreatic necrosis following acute pancreatitis , chronic pancreatitis , surgery , or abdominal trauma.14 previously focusing on the original atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis,5 pfcs include acute fluid collections , acute and chronic pancreatic pseudocysts , pancreatic abscesses , and pancreatic necrosis . pancreatic abscess  to define a  localized collection of purulent material without significant necrotic material . however , since this finding is extremely uncommon , the term  pancreatic abscess  was confusing even investigators of pancreatic diseases . in 2013 , the revised atlanta classification proposed to clarify several issues from the original atlanta classification.6 the revised atlanta classification classified local complications mostly followed by acute pancreatitis into four types according to pathological conditions and timing as follows : 1 ) acute peripancreatic fluid collection ( apfc ) ; 2 ) acute necrotic collection ( anc ) ( sterile or infected ) ; 3 ) pancreatic pseudocyst ( pp ) ; and 4 ) walled - off necrosis ( won ) ( sterile or infected),6 in this classification , the term  pancreatic abscess  was removed and divided into infected pps and wons based on their component and radiologic images.6 until 2013 , an infected pp was lumped together with an infected won in the same category as a pancreatic abscess . thus , an infected anc / pp or won must be set apart from apfc , sterile pp or won based on the revised atlanta classification6 because the strategy of treatment is markedly different ( table 1 ) . the outcome of endoscopic drainage was significantly worse for won compared with pp , with significantly fewer collection disappearances and more complications.7 even if the pp should not always be treated according to the american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy guideline,8 the indication for drainage of pp are symptoms ( abdominal pain , early satiety ) , complications ( infection , bleeding , rupture ) , obstruction of a surrounding hollow viscous ( gastric , duodenal , or biliary obstruction ) , or enlarged pp . drainage of pp was also recommended if the pps were larger than 6 cm , continued to increase in size or did not resolve after 4 to 6 weeks7 as well as symptomatic lesions . infected anc was also recommended for drainage similarly to an infected pp . on the other hand , infected wons , which consisted of a mature , encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis that has developed a well - defined inflammatory wall , were recommended for not only drainage but also necrosectomy if needed . at present , endoscopic drainages are popular as a minimally invasive alternative to surgical or percutaneous drainage for pfc management . of the endoscopic drainages for pfcs , endoscopic ultrasound - guided transluminal drainage ( eus - td ) has become the standard and safe procedure in many centers for the nonsurgical treatment of pfcs because it can provide a safe puncture avoiding intervening blood vessels . thus far , single or multiple plastic stents ( combined with a nasocystic catheter ) have commonly been used for the treatment of pfcs for eus - td . more recently , the use of covered self - expandable metallic stents ( csemss ) has provided a safer and more efficient approach route for internal drainage . in this review , we focus on the best approach and stent to use in endoscopic drainage for pfcs on the basis of the original atlanta classification5 because of lack of clinical results confirming the revised atlanta classification.6 a recent retrospective study regarding nonsurgical approaches  percutaneous versus endoscopic transmural drainage ( conventional direct transluminal drainage by forward - viewing endoscopy [ ctd ] or eus - td)to symptomatic pp revealed no significant difference between technical success rates in treating pp.9 however , percutaneous transmural drainage was associated with a higher reintervention rate , longer hospital stay , and increased number of follow - up abdominal imaging studies.9 therefore , endoscopic transmural drainage should be the preferred modality for the drainage of symptomatic pp compared with percutaneous drainage . a recent prospective randomized controlled trial regarding surgical drainage versus eus - td for symptomatic pp revealed no difference in treatment success , complications , or reinterventions between the surgical and eus - td groups , the length of hospital stay was shorter , the physical and mental health scores were better , and the total mean costs were lower for the eus - td group.10 because none of the patients randomized to eus - td developed pp recurrence at the follow - up evaluation , there was no evidence to suggest that surgical drainage is superior to eus - td for pp drainage . thus , endoscopic drainage for pp drainage has become an effective alternative treatment to percutaneous and surgical drainage . endoscopic drainage is now considered to be the first - line approach for treating symptomatic pp due to its less invasiveness , lower reinterventions , lower morbidity rate , and shorter hospital stay . however , we should consider that surgical treatment still has an important role in terms of adjunctive or salvage therapy if endoscopic or percutaneous intervention fails . endoscopic drainage of pp consists of ctd , transpapillary drainage ( tpd ) and eus - td . in a web - based u.s . survey that identified the american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy members who performed pp drainage in 2006 , eus - td was used only by 56% of u.s . endoscopists and 43% by international endoscopists.11 tpd requires that the pp communicate with the main pancreatic duct and that it has few septations to permit complete drainage . pancreatic duct strictures or disruption , if identified , may be dilated , after which a single plastic stent is placed into the main pancreatic duct . it is also crucial to evaluate for the presence of a pancreatic fistula , which if present , should be initially treated by pancreatic duct stenting . if the pancreatic fistula does not resolve after a prolonged period of pancreatic duct stenting , endoscopic sealing with n - butyl-2-cyanoacrylate can be considered.12 a recent prospective cohort study of patients with refractory pancreatic duct strictures revealed that the use of a wire - guided diathermic dilator is feasible and safe . wire - guided diathermic dilator treatment may be considered a new standard alternative procedure when conventional dilation fails.13 eus - td of pp is an attractive endoscopic approach in patients who have a small window of entry based on computed tomography ( ct ) findings , particularly in the case of lack of an endoscopically defined area of luminal bulging , in unusual locations of pps , with coagulopathy , with thrombocytopenia , with portal hypertension , with documented intervening vessels , in failed ctd or tpd and considering complication during ctd or tpd . a recent prospective randomized controlled trial regarding ctd versus eus - td revealed significant differences regarding technical success in treating pp.14 with regard to clinical outcomes ( short - term and long - term results ) , however , there was no significant difference between ctd and eus - td.14 therefore , for luminal bulging pps , both ctd and eus - td can be selected and performed . however , for nonluminal bulging pps or if ctd or tpd has failed , eus - td has the theoretical advantage of reducing the risk of bleeding , perforation , and infection compared with ctd . the first meta - analysis comparing the technical success and clinical outcomes of eus - td and ctd for pps resulted in the same conclusion.15 utilizing eus - td for pp a prerequisite for eus - td is the presence of a well - defined mature wall . the fluid collection must be accessible endoscopically , such as being located within 1 cm of the gastric or duodenal walls ; paracolic collections can not be accessed and would require adjunctive methods such percutaneous drainage.16 thus , eus - td should be performed as a preferable approach to ctd or tpd ( table 2 ) . to date , current reports in the literature regarding eus - td for pp have documented recent developments and improvement of outcomes.17,18 currently , the type , size , and number of stents used for eus - td are the major concerns of interest . the fistula tract between the gastrointestinal tract and the pp is maintained with the placement of double pigtail plastic stents for preventing dislocation and migration . although double pigtail plastic stents have been used to provide drainage , occlusion rates are high and endoscopic access to the pp cavity via the fistula is limited because of its small caliber . therefore , placement of multiple small - caliber ( including simultaneous placement of a pigtail stent and a nasocystic drainage catheter ) ( figs 13 ) or large - caliber pigtail plastic stents is required to maintain a large fistula for sufficient and effective drainage . however , small - caliber plastic stents are needed for multiple attempts and accesses to the cavity . these procedures may cause loss of the guidewire ( failure of multiple stenting ) , proximal migration of the first stent into the cavity , additional time , and a more cumbersome procedure . on the other hand , large - caliber stents can be difficult to advance and deploy through the channel of the eus scope . recently , tubular csemss ( tcsems ) , which are used for the treatment of a biliary stricture , have been available for pp drainage instead of multiple plastic stents . the tcsems provide larger calibers than plastic stents , which might be advantageous for contaminated and excessive amounts of debris although it is much more expensive than plastic stents ( table 3 ) . the tcsems can also reduce the risk of perforation , leakage and bleeding because of minimal dilation and sealing of the fistula tract including tamponade effects . several reports of a case or case series of pp have indicated the utility of csemss for drainage . a summary of these reports showed 93 patients with pp using csems ( table 4).1933 the technical success rate from published cases was 100% ( 93/93 pps ) . pp resolution was achieved in 94.6% ( 88/93 pps ) with complete resolution in 90.6% ( 77/85 pps ) . the complication rate was 21.1% ( 19/76 pps ) . among them , the most common complication was superinfection to pps , with a mild degree of severity . on the other hand , the csems migration rate was 3.9% ( 3/76 pps ) and the buried csems rate was 2.6% ( 2/76 pps ) . partial or full csems migration is a significant problem because csemss are tubular conduits and do not have anchoring flanges . to prevent migration , the placement of a double pigtail stent or a nasocystic catheter through the csems may be effective to serve as an anchoring effect . the currently available and used csemss were designed for drainage related to a luminal stricture , but were not related to a transluminal route . when a bile duct or an esophageal stent is used for pp , the longer protrusion on both the gastrointestinal tract and the pp cavity sides entails a risk of contact ulceration , bleeding , or migration . they are not good options in cases when the pp is not firmly attached to the gastrointestinal wall , because they do not apply any anchorage force and the risk of leakage is high.30 more recently , new dedicated anchoring fully covered semss ( acsemss ) for pp have been developed , such as wide flared end ( fig . 4 ; ( a , b ) nagi stent , taewoong medical co. , ltd . , seoul , korea,31 ( c , d ) bcf stent , m.i.tech co. , ltd . , seoul , korea ) or anchoring ( fig . 4 ; ( e ) axios , xlumena inc . , mountain view , ca , usa)22 to prevent migration ( figs 57 ) . these types of acsems provide stent stability , minimize the risk of migration due to an anchoring effect , and maintain the larger sems lumen for passage , which may enable easy direct access into the pp cavity without a nonliquid component after expanding in full diameter . what is the optimal stent for pp ?  the answers to this question are straightforward . at the present shape22 is an ideal stent and is highly recommended for treating pp in terms of antimigration and the direct insertion of an endoscope through the acsems . the stent anchors are designed to distribute pressure evenly on the luminal wall and securely anchor the stent , thus preventing migration . the proximal and distal anchor flanges are designed to hold the bile duct and duodenal wall in apposition , preventing leakage between the two nonadherent organs . what remains controversial and yet to be determined are the appropriate period for stent placement and the optimal stent diameter . stents for pfcs act as a conduit and facilitate drainage of pancreatic secretion from the disconnected gland . in a prospective randomized controlled trial involving the removal versus nonremoval of stents , the rate of pfc recurrence following stent removal was significantly higher , particularly in patients with main pancreatic duct rupture.34 it is likely that pfc resolution leads to the eventual adherence of the cavity wall , leading to the gradual migration of the stent toward the gastrointestinal lumen . stent removal occurring before complete pfc collapse might lead to pfc recurrence , particularly if a communication exists between the pfc and the pancreatic duct.35 prolonged transluminal stent placement has been adopted as a strategy to prevent pfc recurrence , that is , the stent remaining in its proper position reduces the recurrence rate of pfc.36 on the contrary , the appropriate duration of stent placement is recommended to be short ( 7 to 10 days ) because of a significant risk of stent migration if the stents were left in place longer than 10 days.37 however , the short duration of stent placement may not be sufficient to create an adequately mature fistula tract that will consequently tolerate balloon dilation and direct endoscopic necrosectomy.28 the clinical data on pancreatic abscess or infected won are more limited and generally poor , owing to the need to remove abscess and necrotic debris , than in the case of pp drainage . however , in collections with necrotic debris , the success rate falls with the drainage of cyst contents alone . subsequent direct endoscopic necrosectomy has therefore been performed for an infected anc , pp , or won . we should consider direct endoscopic necrosectomy under the following conditions : 1 ) necrotizing pancreatitis is present ; 2 ) us , eus , ct , or magnetic resonance images show solid components in the fluid collection ; and 3 ) acute inflammation suggesting an infected won is present.38 several sessions are necessary for sufficient necrosectomy to improve inflammation . for this technique , placement of multiple plastic stents and repeated large - diameter balloon dilatation are required in each session . recently , a prospective randomized controlled trial of direct endoscopic drainage / necrosectomy of pancreatic abscess or infected won versus surgical management has been performed.39 in this recent study involving patients with an infected won , endoscopic necrosectomy reduced the proinflammatory response ( serum interleukin-6 ) as well as the new - onset multiple organ failure , intra - abdominal bleeding requiring intervention , enterocutaneous fistula or perforation of a visceral organ requiring intervention and pancreatic fistula compared with surgical necrosectomy . in the study design , multiple plastic stenting for infected won following repeated balloon dilation was performed . a summary of studies reporting the use of csems in 56 patients with pancreatic abscess or infected wons is shown in table 5.20,23,27,28,30,31,38,4043 the technical success rate ( 100% , 57/57 pancreatic abscess or wons ) and the pancreatic abscess or infected won complete resolution rate ( 87.8% , 43/49 pancreatic abscess or infected wons ) were high similarly to pps . the complication rate was low ( 9.5% , 4/42 pancreatic abscess or infected wons ) compared with pps . larger diameter csems without additional fistula tract dilation for the passage of a standard scope is needed to access and drain for pancreatic abscess or infected wons with solid debris . during direct endoscopic necrosectomy through the csems , such csems interferes with the operation of the endoscope . on the other hand , the sems length was selected on the basis of the size of the pp , pancreatic abscess or won , with 1/3 to 1/2 of the sems protruding into the gastrointestinal tract at the level of the flared ends permitting apposition of the pp , pancreatic abscess or won to the gastrointestinal tract.43 commercially available biliary semss neither offer a large diameter that allows a larger channel endoscope to be inserted in order to perform necrosectomy , nor permit complete apposition of the wons to the wall of the gastrointestinal tract . therefore , an anchoring fcsems particularly with a dumbbell shape is also strongly desired for treating infected anc / pp or wons . the conventional single transluminal gateway drainage using transmural stenting ( single or multiple plastic stents or large - bore semss ) has allowed the complete resolution of unilocural or uncomplicated pfcs . however , single gateway drainage for complicated or infected wons is limited and often insufficient . multilocular or huge infected won requires multiple transluminal gateway drainage because of the presence of undrained subcavities.4446 when subcavities or undrained areas of the main cavity are in a location far from the gastrointestinal tract , eus - td is not possible . single transluminal gateway transcystic multiple drainage might be a better technique for these cases.45 if endoscopic intervention fails for complicated won , the hybrid technique using endoscopic and percutaneous approaches is recommended and might be a better approach . eus - td with sems placement for infected pp , pancreatic abscess or wons is a technically feasible and apparently safe alternative to ctd and td . eus - td with sems placement can be considered as the first - line therapy for pp . with increasing data showing better clinical outcome of eus - td with csems , it is highly recommendable to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial of plastic stent versus csems for pp drainage to determine the long - term outcome and allow cost analysis . finally , future clinical prospective studies should be conducted to validate local complications of acute pancreatitis on the basis of the revised atlanta classification.6","endoscopic drainage for pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections ( pfcs ) has been increasingly used as a minimally invasive alternative to surgical or percutaneous drainage . recently , endoscopic ultrasound - guided transluminal drainage ( eus - td ) has become the standard of care and a safe procedure for nonsurgical pfc treatment . 
 eus - td ensures a safe puncture , avoiding intervening blood vessels . single or multiple plastic stents ( combined with a nasocystic catheter ) were used for the treatment of pfcs for eus - td . 
 more recently , the use of covered self - expandable metallic stents ( csemss ) has provided a safer and more efficient approach route for internal drainage . 
 we focused our review on the best approach and stent to use in endoscopic drainage for pfcs . 
 we reviewed studies of eus - td for pfcs based on the original atlanta classification , including case reports , case series , and previous review articles . 
 data on clinical outcomes and adverse events were collected retrospectively . 
 a total of 93 patients underwent eus - td of pancreatic pseudocysts using csemss . the treatment success and adverse event rates were 94.6% and 21.1% , respectively . 
 the majority of complications were of mild severity and resolved with conservative therapy . 
 a total of 56 patients underwent eus - td using csemss for pancreatic abscesses or infected walled - off necroses . the treatment success and 
 adverse event rates were 87.8% and 9.5% , respectively . 
 eus - td can be performed safely and efficiently for pfc treatment . 
 larger diameter csemss without additional fistula tract dilation for the passage of a standard scope are needed to access and drain for pfcs with solid debris .",366
"pycnodysostosis was first reported in 1923 by montanari , and he called it as atypical achondroplasia . the main characteristics are short stature , cranial dysplasia , increased bone density and fragility . other clinical features include open cranial sutures , hypoplastic paranasal sinuses , dysplastic lateral clavicle , shortened terminal phalanges , proptosis , blue sclera and frontal or occipital bossing . oral manifestations include obtuse gonial angle , grooved palate , anterior cross - bite , malpositioned teeth associated with increased incidence of dental caries and periodontitis , hypoplastic maxilla , receded chin , delayed eruption of permanent teeth , delayed exfoliation of deciduous teeth and hypoplasia of root - obliterated pulp spaces . a 47-year - old man reported to the department with a complaint of deformed lower jaw for the past 10 years . history revealed that the patient had undergone extraction of his teeth that was uneventful , following which there was fracture of jaw at the extraction site . subsequently , there was frequent exfoliation of teeth with fracture at different sites in the lower jaw . his medical history revealed that he had multiple fractures of the upper and lower limbs and a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension . general examination revealed that the patient 's height was 127 cm and weight was around 49 kg , with proportionate dwarfism [ figure 1 ] . the hand and feet had short digits with overlying cutaneous wrinkles that tapered off with large overriding nails [ figure 2 ] . a 47-year - old man , 127 cm in height shortened digits and cutaneous wrinkles on extraoral examination , there was facial dysmorphia with prominent forehead ( frontal bossing ) , proptosis , beaked nose , deep nasolabial skin folds , micrognathia and obtuse mandibular angle on the right side [ figure 3 ] . mild proptosis and facial dysmorphia intraoral examination revealed multiple clinically missing teeth , chronic periodontitis , narrow and grooved palate , no features of enamel hypoplasia , malposed teeth [ figure 4 ] and evidence of sequestrum in relation to the tooth 46 [ figure 5 ] . based on the history and clinical presentation , a provisional diagnosis of a bone dysplasia , probably pycnodysostosis , was made and differential diagnosis of cleidocranial dysplasia and osteopetrosis was included . grooved palate and clinically missing maxillary anteriors sequestrum in relation to tooth 46 laboratory findings were within normal limits , including hemoglobin conc . , differential count calcium , phosphate , alkaline and acid phophatase level . computed tomography of the bone window of the skull showed open sutures and fontenalles with nonaerated paranasal sinuses , flattening of the mandibular angle on the right side with evidence of fracture and loss of bone architecture on the left side involving the ramus of the body of the mandible and hypoplastic maxilla [ figures 68 ] . orthopantomograph revealed generalized bone loss , multiple missing teeth and obtuse gonial angle with loss of bone structure on the left side of the mandible involving the body and ramus [ figure 9 ] . 3d - reconstructed computed tomography showing open sutures and fontanelles 3d - reconstructed computed tomography showing fractured body of the mandible and obtuse gonial angle 3d - reconstructed computed tomography showing fractured body of the mandible opg showing generalized bone loss , multiple missing teeth , and obtuse gonial angle lateral skull showing open fontanelles with nonaerated paranasal sinus and fractured body of the mandible the patient was surgically managed for osteomyelitis by removal of the sequestrum and curettage , and further mandibular reconstruction was performed . the patient presents with characteristic facies , dwarfism , beaked nose , prominent head and generalized increase in the density of bones not sufficient to obliterate medullary canals or cranial orifices . frequent fractures due to trauma can aid in diagnosing this condition . in our case , the patient was negligent about the condition and reported to us with a fractured jaw . intraoral clinical presentation included altered pattern of exfoliation of deciduous teeth and eruption of the permanent dentition . the disease is diagnosed at an early age , wherein the main reasons for consultation are generally short stature and open anterior fontanelles . in later stages , consultation is usually for fracture resulting from slight or moderate trauma , given the severe bone fragility . symptoms include dental abnormalities , with hypoplasia of the enamel , obliterated pulp chambers and hypercementosis . protrusion of the incisors with anterior open bite may be found , and dental crowding associated with extensive caries and periodontitis is frequent . in our case , multiple clinically missing teeth , chronic periodontitis , narrow and grooved palate , features of enamel hypoplasia and malposed teeth these conditions cause the premature loss of dentition that may already be complete by the fourth decade of life , similar to our patients . our patient showed evidence of sequestrum in relation to the tooth 46 as a result of osteomyelitis . orofacial infections are commonly encountered by the dentist and there are wide ranges of modalities that can be implemented in managing them . this is caused by the increased bone volume of the sella turcica that , on compressing the pituitary gland , causes its hypoplasia and a deficient production of the growth hormone . our patient 's height was 127 cm and weight was around 49 kg , with proportionate dwarfism . the hand and feet had short digits with overlying cutaneous wrinkles that tapered off with large overriding nails . diagnosis of pycnodysostosis is based on the clinical presentation , and medical treatment for the condition is symptomatic . the differential diagnosis of pycnodysostosis includes osteopetrosis , acroosteolysis , mandibular acral dysplasia and cleidocranial dysplasia . unlike osteoporosis , hepatosplenomegaly and difference between pycnodysostosis and cleidocranial dysplasia is that dense and brittle bones are found in pycnodysostosis but not in cleidocranial dysplasia . new treatment modalities like gene therapy and bone marrow transplant can be expected to be the mainstay in the future , now that the abnormal expression of cathepsin k and the gene defect has been located . now - a - days , symptomatic treatment is provided for patients with pycnodysostosis , with the main intention of prevention of fractures . as pycnodysostosis is associated with inappropriate bone remodeling , it can pose a challenge for a dental health care professional to provide treatment as there can be serious complications , such as osteomyelitis arising as a result of dental infections . tooth extractions in these patients demand certain special care , such as carrying out the surgery atraumatically with proper asepsis . oral hygiene practices and frequent visits to","pycnodysostosis , a sclerosing bone dysplasia , is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an estimated prevalence rate of one in one million . 
 patients with pycnodyostosis usually have normal intelligence , sexual development and life span . 
 this condition is characterized by increased bone density and fragility along with oral manifestations like malposition teeth , hypoplastic maxilla , receded chin and delayed eruption of permanent teeth with discharging sinuses in the jaws because of poor blood supply . 
 this is one such rare case report of a 47-year - old patient presenting with a complaint of fractured jaw and reviewing the clinical and radiographic characteristics of pycnodysostosis .",141
"strokes produce important physical , psychological and social consequences , in spite of 
 advances in prevention and early care1 . several studies highlight the importance of cognitive activities such as attention , memory 
 and action observation on the nervous system plasticity2 , 3 . the experiences and the 
 information generated by these cognitive activities influence motor learning4 , 5 . 
 hence , the importance of providing the patient with learning experiences and sensory stimuli 
 enriched by the interaction with a therapist6 . after stroke , achieving patients functionality ( e.g. being able to turn a door handle ) has 
 become the focus of the therapeutic action . the emphasis of treatment has virtually always 
 been focused on performing the task , regardless of how it was executed , whereas the 
 qualitative aspects of the activity have not been considered to be important7 , 8 . taking into account the 
 knowledge on motor learning which highlights not only the motor processes but also the 
 sensory and cognitive strategies5 , it is 
 possible to direct the therapeutic performance to  recovery  instead of  compensation  . this 
 implies focusing the intervention more on the quality of execution rather than on the final 
 result , promoting an adequate activation of the existing patterns prior to the injury5 , 9 . a therapeutic strategy that addresses these approaches is the cognitive therapeutic 
 exercise based on the neurocognitive rehabilitation theory described by the neurologist 
 carlo perfetti10 , 11 . this theory connects the activation of cognitive processes with 
 sensory - motor recovery by means of the patient learning new interaction patterns with their 
 surroundings10 , 11 . although its effectiveness in orthopedic rehabilitation has been 
 recently demonstrated12,13,14 , there is a need 
 for well - designed studies in neurological patients . a prior randomized clinical trial15 in acute stroke used a protocol with an 
 unclear and non - specific methodology and it concluded without statistically significant 
 evidence between the two groups . recently , significant differences were found on upper limb 
 functions from chronic stroke patients , regarding activities of daily living and quality of 
 life16 . our study has implemented a protocol based on the neurocognitive approach considering and 
 acting on the individual s motor , sensory and cognitive characteristics . the aim was to 
 determine its feasibility and evaluate whether subjects treated with this protocol improved 
 qualitative upper extremity ( ue ) movement . we hypothesized that subjects who received the 
 neurocognitive protocol would show greater improvements on motor , sensory and cognitive 
 functional aspects when compared with those treated with a conventional protocol , and these 
 positive changes would also demonstrate clinical and significant improvements on ue 
 functionality with maintenance at follow - up . the 
 inclusion criteria were : diagnosis of subacute ischemic stroke ( from 15 days to 3 months , 
 middle cerebral artery territory ) , age between 25 and 80 , mini - mental test 24 , motor 
 deficits in ue caused by stroke ( motricity index < 99 ) and enough trunk control to be able 
 to sit with dorsal support . exclusion criteria were : global aphasia , somatoagnosia or 
 neglect , modified ashworth scale > 2 and carrying out other types of therapies at the same 
 time as the study with the exception of the occupational therapy treatment applied to all 
 participants of the study . the study was approved by the hospital s 
 clinical investigation ethics committee ( register number : ac-11 - 094 ) and conducted according 
 to the helsinki declaration . following enrollment , participants were randomized consecutively for 10 months by a random 
 number table into two groups : the control group ( cg ) which received conventional physical 
 therapy and the experimental group ( eg ) with the neurocognitive protocol . the evaluator was 
 a widely experienced and trained physical therapist in assessing and treating stroke 
 patients . the 
 percentage of adherence rate of 80 and 100% required for treatment and assessments ( a ) , 
 respectively , as well as the percentage of retention rate of 85% were established and 
 controlled by both therapists . a panel of scales was applied at the beginning of the study ( a1 ) , at 5 weeks ( a2 ) , at the 
 end of the treatment in the 10th week ( a3 ) and at a follow - up 10 weeks later ( a4 ) . the 
 primary outcome was the motor evaluation scale for upper extremity in stroke patients 
 ( mesupes ) score to assess ue functionality . the result is 
 obtained by adding together the points at each assessment ( a1234 ) . each item is scored 
 from 0 ( inability to adapt muscle tone to the movement ) to 5 ( ability to correct and 
 complete motion without help ) . mesupes - hand consists of 9 wrist and finger items scored on a 
 3-pointed rating scale : no movement or incorrect=0 ; movement incomplete=1 ; movement 
 complete=28 , 17 . the minimal detectable change ( mdc ) for the total score with 95% 
 confidence level was calculated and resulted in a score difference of 8 to be necessary for 
 a genuine change of function additional outcomes included : the motricity index test , validated for the quantitative 
 assessment of paretic ue muscle strength . in this study the arm score is the result of adding together the 
 points for the 3 arm test + 1 at each assessment ( a1234)18 . the revised nottingham sensory assessment is a standardized scale 
 for evaluating sensory impairment in stroke patients19 . the kinesthesia subscale is applied bilaterally on the shoulder , 
 elbow , wrist and metacarpal - phalangeal joint at each assessment ( a1234 ) . it is scored 
 from 0 ( absent sensation ) to 3 ( correct position ) . the light touch subscale displays the 
 result of adding together every assessment score on the shoulder , elbow , wrist and palm . it 
 is scored on a 3 point rating scale : absent sensation=0 ; impaired sensation=1 ; normal 
 sensation=219 . the kinesthetic and 
 visual imagery questionnaire assesses the cognitive aspect of imagining a movement in its 
 two main dimensions , visual and kinesthetic20 . it shows the result of adding together the points of each upper 
 extremity item at each assessment with the exception of a2 when no change was expected to be 
 observed . both dimensions evaluated shoulder elevation , forward shoulder flexion , elbow 
 flexion / extension , thumb - fingers opposition on a score from 1 ( no image or sensation ) to 5 
 ( image as clear as seeing or as intense as executing the action)20 . the values obtained with mesupes at a1 allowed the blinded evaluator to determine the level 
 of motor involvement required by every participant ( passive , active - assisted or active ) . the 
 evaluator also recommended sensory and cognitive difficulties of the exercises , but those 
 recommendations were only followed by the physical therapist in the eg treatment . in both groups the intervention consisted of passive , active - assisted and active 
 mobilizations with freedom of directions . proprioceptive joint information was provided on 
 the shoulder , elbow , wrist and fingers segments in addition to tactile information , using 
 different textured surfaces ( rough , fine , etc . ) , on palms and fingers21 , 22 . both groups 
 performed a 30-minute treatment with 3 individual sessions / week for 10 weeks23 , 24 . fifteen minutes were dedicated to shoulder , elbow and wrist and 15 
 minutes to the affected hand . the participant was positioned in a supine position for the 
 first part and in a sitting position for the second one8 . during ue mobilizations and the contact with different surfaces , eg participants received 
 the proposal of sensory discrimination tasks organized in a hierarchy ( from lower to higher 
 difficulty)12 , 13 , 22 , 25 , 26 ( table 1table

 involved cognitive activation of learning strategies such as observation , motor imagery , 
 imitation , etc12 , 13 , 25,26,27 . every task was proposed 
 as a problem to be resolved with closed eyes13 , 22 , 25 , 26 . the physical therapist began with the 
 most suitable task for each participant and continued with the following one after the 
 satisfactory completion of the first task5 , 12 , 13 . in addition , the physical therapist could constantly adapt the 
 protocol to the individual s level based on daily observation but always under the protocol 
 guidelines , designed by an experienced physical therapist and based on the neurocognitive 
 theory12 , 13 . no discrimination tasks were established in the cg although mobilizations and different 
 surfaces were proposed28 , 29 . hence , cg participants received the same type of 
 information ( propioceptive and tactile ) but they were not asked to resolve any problem nor 
 to be aware of their body sensations . individual characteristics and therapy adherence were expressed as mean  standard 
 deviation ( sd ) . the therapy adherence rate ( % ) was also reported . outcome measure data were 
 reported as score differences between the post and pre - study ( a4a1 ) for each participant , 
 the a1 and a4 median ( md ) for each group as well as between each assessment ( md of a2a1 , 
 a3a2 and a4a3 ) . nonparametric statistical tests were employed . the pearson  
 test and mann - whitney u test the wilcoxon signed rank test allowed pre - post clinical evolution from the 
 beginning to the end of the study to be determined in both groups and the mann - whitney u 
 test was used to compare the changes between groups on a1 and a4 . a significance level of 
 0.05 has been used in all analyses but considered only in an exploratory sense . seven subjects with involvement of the right middle cerebral artery and one of the left 
 were finally considered for analysis . one subject withdrew after a2 because of personal 
 reasons and was discarded ( retention rate=89% ) . the average age was 53.4  9.6  years old , 
 seven males and one woman , all of whom were right - handed . no statistically significant differences between groups were 
 found relating to gender ( p=1 ) and injured hemisphere ( p=1 ) nor age ( p=0.89 ) and time from 
 stroke onset to treatment ( p=0.89 ) . all the participants attended at least 80% of the 
 treatment sessions and all four assessments . this represents an adherence intervention rate of 95.8% in the 10-week treatment period and 
 an assessment rate of 100% in the 20-week study period . although not statistically significant , there were more relevant pre - post study 
 improvements in the eg on mesupes arm and hand subscales . these changes appeared earlier and 
 lasted throughout the study in the eg . despite random assignment , significant differences 
 between groups were found at a1 with lower hand values in the cg ( p=0.03 ) . in terms of the 
 minimal detectable change ( mdc ) , all the participants of the eg and 2 of the cg ( participant 
 1 and 4 ) reached pre - post clinical changes . the secondary outcome measures showed neither 
 statistically significant differences ( p>0.05 ) between groups nor pre - post study changes

 questionnaire this study aims to show the influence of motor , sensory and cognitive aspects on ue 
 recovery in subacute stroke patients through the comparison between a neurocognitive 
 protocol and a conventional treatment . the combined use of a panel of scales is also 
 proposed as it allows the different components involved in motor control to be segregated 
 and assessed . in particular , mesupes has allowed us to determine the individual s initial 
 and successive states in terms of movement quality concerning functional tasks . the 
 preliminary results of both groups suggest the use of mesupes to obtain stratified sampling 
 in larger studies . thus , by obtaining more accurate information , the adaptation of the 
 protocol to the characteristics of each individual is facilitated . the high adherence of 
 participants in treatment and assessments sessions could be explained by both these 
 factors . although the results were not statistically significant , due partially to the small sample 
 studied , they are of important clinical relevance . furthermore , it resulted in a considerable improvement in the 
 functional autonomy of the ue . in particular , all the eg participants and 2 of the cg showed 
 the score differences ( mdc ) needed to obtain a clinical change . the mesupes scale shows improvements in both groups indicating that neurocognitive and 
 conventional treatments have been useful to ue functionality ( table 2 ) ; but also demonstrating that the neurocognitive one ( eg ) 
 promotes more benefits in all segments ( shoulder , elbow , wrist and hand ) . this group 
 presented superior pre - post changes on arm and hand subscales . in previous studies by lang 
 et al.30,31,32 , a higher recovery of the 
 proximal segments is questioned and lack of differences between proximal and distal joints 
 is reported . our pilot study highlights a greater distal recovery , where the changes for the 
 hands were higher , and occurred earlier in the eg , as a probable consequence of giving 
 greater importance to their treatment . this is consistent with perfetti s concept of the 
 hand10 , 11 , considered as an essential element for the interaction with the 
 objects inside the action , in which the movements of the more proximal segments are involved 
 and acquire their significance . to do so , it should be noted that the exercises proposed for 
 the hands included kinesthetic and tactile information due to their importance concerning 
 hand functionality25 , 26 . the evolution of both groups supports the importance of starting 
 treatment as soon as possible33,34,35 and maintaining 
 it for at least 10 weeks . with exception of some studies on chronic stroke , there is little 
 evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation beyond this period , because no further 
 treatments are usually maintained 3 months after the stroke36 . in the present study , these months coincide with the period 
 between a3 and a4 , in which there was an overall stabilization of the evolution of ue 
 functionality in the cg , while improvements in the eg were still observed . in addition , the 
 improvements from a1 to a4 may indicate the importance of both motor learning strategies 
 through the discrimination tasks5 , 37 and also the need to extend the treatment 
 beyond this period of time for a better recovery38 . in concordance with previous studies34 , 35 that show the 
 correlation between the individual s initial state and the prognosis , we have also found 
 that subjects with mild or moderate severity have a better functional outcome reached in a 
 shorter time compared to those with higher severity , despite the fact that these subjects 
 are also expected to show an evident improvement at the end of the rehabilitation . earlier and superior improvements in muscle strength were found in the eg . these gains 
 obtained mainly in the first 5 weeks for both groups did not correlate with increased 
 functionality throughout the 10 weeks of treatment . this is evidenced by the mesupes scale 
 for all segments in the eg and for the hand in the cg . this would indicate that although 
 muscle strength , assessed by the motricity index , is gained at the beginning in all 
 segments , more time is needed to translate its gains into functionality improvement through 
 training28 . moreover , it would indicate 
 that favorable progression in ue movement depends mainly on parameters such as accuracy , 
 fluidity , coordination or correlation between joints7 , 
 32 , 39 , 
 40 . all of these are qualitative 
 aspects in which sensory discrimination has an important role25 , 26 . there are still few studies about the effects of passive movement in brain areas during the 
 processing of tactile and kinesthetic information ; but van de winckel et al.25 , 26 
 have already observed that , under both normal and stroke conditions , passive sensory 
 discrimination causes the activation of parietal , pre - motor and motor areas in a similar way 
 as active exploration . there are different studies about sensory treatment protocols on 
 stroke patients for recovering sensory impairments21 , 
 22 . on the other hand , our pilot study 
 aims for movement recovery by sensory processing tasks . despite the need for more 
 homogeneous research into the impact of sensory impairments on motor and functional ue 
 recovery41 the importance of maintaining the 
 treatment during at least 10 weeks is also supported by sensory results . the light touch trend of 
 improving after the treatment period could be an indicator of the learning factor which is 
 highlighted in the neurocognitive protocol . in the eg , kinesthetic maximum values were 
 obtained at the end of 10 weeks , unlike the cg where improvements were mainly in the first 5 
 weeks . considering that kinesthesic median values at a1 in both groups were high , there was 
 not a great deal of margin for improvement ( table 
 2 ) . these results lead us to highlight the role of tactile and kinesthetic 
 discrimination in improving ue functionality . finally , the cognitive element assessed has been the ability to imagine the ue movement . as 
 in some studies20 , 43 , the values of healthy ue were higher in its two dimensions ( visual 
 and kinesthetic ) . these results suggest that motor and sensory deficits affect the capacity 
 to imagine the body part involved , despite still being in the subacute phase ( 15 days to 3 
 months ) , but this capability changes within a short period of time ( days or a few weeks ) . in 
 the present study both groups evolved favorably and similarly over the 10 
 weeks of treatment , until almost reaching the maximum score of the visual image . we can 
 hypothesize that , unlike the kinesthetic image , this component is altered in early stages 
 ( acute and subacute ) . conversely , the constant arrival of pathological information as well 
 as the probable difficulty in remembering the correct movement sensations would subsequently 
 cause a kinesthetic image disorder . the recovery of motor memory needs a better and stable 
 representation of the primary motor area achieved with guided therapeutic exercises44 . a potential limitation in the study is 
 that other cognitive elements also activated in the discriminatory tasks , such as memory or 
 attention , were not evaluated . some studies45 , 46 have demonstrated the facilitation of 
 tactile processing in the primary sensory area through attention . other limitations of this study include the lack of neuroimaging techniques to gather 
 further data and a small sample size that resulted in unequal comparison groups with respect 
 to mesupes outcomes despite random assignment . this study used a blinded evaluator to 
 decrease the likelihood of biased assessment measures . in general , our results support the protocol feasibility and the use of a panel of scales 
 in order to obtain more accurate evidence of the neurocognitive approach effectiveness by 
 means of a larger study . despite the fact that some clinical trials have been recently 
 published about neurocognitive treatment using a similar approach , their results are not 
 easily comparable to ours , because chanubol et al.15 and lee et al.16 
 performed protocols without establishing clearly either the selection criteria of exercises 
 level or their progression . sensory and cognition assessments were not applied and the other 
 assessments were only performed before and after treatment . despite the lack of statistical significance , this pilot study indicates that upper 
 extremity movement deficits improve when exercises with motor , sensory and cognitive 
 components are performed following a neurocognitive approach . a careful selection of the 
 appropriate difficulty for each individual as well as the guidance of a therapist in the 
 cognitive and sensory processes allow greater and prolonged improvements over time on the 
 upper extremity , especially for the hand function . the neurocognitive approach is a safe , 
 useful and easily applicable way to work with stroke patients in any rehabilitation center . although further research is necessary , the feasibility of the proposed protocol facilitates 
 the carrying out of a clinical trial to consolidate evidence of these findings .","[ purpose ] this study aims to describe a protocol based on neurocognitive therapeutic 
 exercises and determine its feasibility and usefulness for upper extremity functionality 
 when compared with a conventional protocol . 
 [ subjects and methods ] eight subacute stroke 
 patients were randomly assigned to a conventional ( control group ) or neurocognitive 
 ( experimental group ) treatment protocol . 
 both lasted 30 minutes , 3 times a week for 10 
 weeks and assessments were blinded . 
 outcome measures included : motor evaluation scale for 
 upper extremity in stroke patients , motricity index , revised nottingham sensory assessment 
 and kinesthetic and visual imagery questionnaire . 
 descriptive measures and nonparametric 
 statistical tests were used for analysis . [ results ] 
 the results indicate a more favorable 
 clinical progression in the neurocognitive group regarding upper extremity functional 
 capacity with achievement of the minimal detectable change . 
 the functionality results are 
 related with improvements on muscle strength and sensory discrimination ( tactile and 
 kinesthetic ) . 
 [ conclusion ] despite not showing significant group differences between pre 
 and post - treatment , the neurocognitive approach could be a safe and useful strategy for 
 recovering upper extremity movement following stroke , especially regarding affected hands , 
 with better and longer lasting results . 
 although this work shows this protocol s 
 feasibility with the panel of scales proposed , larger studies are required to demonstrate 
 its effectiveness .",281
"stairway falls are a leading cause of injury in patients less than 5  years of age [ 1 , 2 ] . while the majority of these injuries occur when a child steps down the stairs , approximately 3  % of injuries will be associated with a caregiver falling while carrying a child . this specific mechanism has been shown to result in injury patterns that are more likely to necessitate hospitalization and more likely to involve trauma to the head and fractures to the extremities . while it is often necessary for a parent or caregiver to carry children in their arms while walking down stairs , the child may obstruct the caretaker s view on the stairway ( fig . this can lead to a fall by the caretaker and an injury to the child and/or caretaker . to date , several previous studies have been conducted evaluating stairway injuries in children , but none have focused on this specific mechanism ( fall from caregiver s arms ) or the injuries associated with these falls . the goal of this study was to identify injuries that may occur when a caretaker falls while carrying a child on a stairway , to understand the pathomechanics of this injury , and to perform a cost analysis of the injury.fig . d bird s eye view of how the child can obstruct the caretaker s view on the stairway a side view of the caretaker s unobstructed view on the stairway . d bird s eye view of how the child can obstruct the caretaker s view on the stairway emergency department and orthopedic clinic records were reviewed between 2004 and 2012 to identify patients with an orthopedic injury after a fall from stairs . sixteen children were retrospectively found to have a fracture from a  fall - in - arms  injury sustained while a caregiver was going down stairs , and were included in this study . patient identification occurred at a routine weekly fracture conference , where every emergency department fracture in which the orthopedic service was consulted was presented . if the patient met the inclusion criteria , they were then added to the database . the following demographic and epidemiologic data were recorded for each patient : age , gender , location of injury , and mechanism of fall . additionally , radiographs were reviewed to assess fracture location , type , displacement , and treatment . cost analysis data was obtained from the hospital billing department and included all emergency department care , inpatient care , and subsequent follow - up . this study was granted a waiver of informed consent , including permission and assent , in accordance with 45 cfr 46.116(d ) and 45 cfr 46.408 , and a waiver of hipaa authorization per 45 cfr 164.512(i ) . the study was authorized by the local ethical committee and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 declaration of helsinki as revised in 2000 . sixteen children presented to the emergency room and orthopedic clinic of our hospital after sustaining an injury when their caretaker fell while carrying them down the stairs . our billing records reveal that we , as an institution , treat approximately 9,500 fractures per year , giving an incidence of approximately 1 fracture by this mechanism per 5,000 fractures . interviews with the parents yielded information regarding the specifics of the fall and the possible pathomechanics of the child s injuries . the parent or caregiver noted in all cases that the child was being held in front as they descended the stairs . the child obscured their view and they missed a step and fell ( fig . the age at the time of injury averaged 14  months and ranged from 7  months to 51  months of age . eight ( 50  % ) sustained femur fractures , six ( 38  % ) sustained tibia fractures , and one ( 6  % ) sustained a metatarsal fracture . there was one both bone forearm fracture ( 6  % ) ; this occurred in the eldest child ( 51  months ) . four of these patients , however , required a reduction or manipulation , three of which were performed in the operating room . functionally , all patients did well , with no deficits noted at final follow - up . cost analysis was performed amongst our 16 patients to determine the financial burden accrued in relation to these accidental traumas ( table  1 ) . the average total charge of the treatment of the fractures was $ 6,785 ( standard deviation $ 11,183 ; range $ 948$45,876 ) . five of the 16 children ( 31  % ) had a skeletal survey , as the treating physicians were concerned about possible child abuse ; the average total charge for those receiving a skeletal survey was $ 7,024 . after a social service consultation and a skeletal survey were obtained in these cases , no patient was felt to be the victim of child abuse . for those children not requiring a skeletal survey , three children ( 19  % ) required a closed reduction of their femur fractures in the operating room ; their total care charges averaged $ 23,568 . for the children not treated in the operating room , the average charge was $ 2,912.table  1cost of fall -

accidental trauma work - ups suggested no cases of abuse . additionally , no child in our study had a concomitant injury other than the fracture . this is consistent with other studies , where abused children tended to have other injuries such as bruising as well head and trunk injuries . the total charge for the children who received a skeletal survey as part of their work - up was $ 7,024 . it is the duty of treating physicians  whether they are primary care physicians , emergency room physicians , or orthopedists  to be vigilant in the work - up of suspected nonaccidental trauma , and the skeletal survey is frequently the first test ordered following a history and physical . with that said , in cases where the caregiver can provide a clear history , the skeletal survey can be deferred to minimize costs and radiation exposure to the child . three children in our series had to go to the operating room for a surgical reduction . all of these were for diaphyseal femur fractures that were treated with a spica cast . the costs related to the treatment of these femur fractures dwarf the costs of the other patients in this series . when taken as two separate groups , the average charge for femur fracture treatment in the emergency room was $ 2,912 , compared to $ 23,568 for treatment in the operating room . this study does have limitations and is biased toward orthopedic injuries , as all of the cases reported were obtained through orthopedic emergency room consults and clinic visits . isolated injuries to the head or torso would not involve an orthopedic consult and thus were not included in this group . this most likely underestimates the total number of children seen at our hospital due to a fall down stairs while being carried by a caregiver . additionally , the number of children with relatively minor injuries who did not seek medical treatment further underestimates the true incidence of this mechanism of injury . this paper describes the type of orthopedic injuries sustained during a fall down stairs while in a caregiver s arms . what our study adds to the literature is that nearly one - third of the children underwent a skeletal survey due to concerns regarding child abuse . additionally , the average cost of these injuries was not insignificant and averaged $ 6,785 . thirdly , we believe that the pathomechanics of this injury are as follows : the caregiver descends the stairs carrying a child in front.the size of the child obscures the view of the subsequent stair ( fig . 1a  d).the caregiver misses the step and falls.the momentum usually causes the caregiver and child to fall forward down the stairs ( fig .  2).fig . 2they miss the step and fall , often landing on the child as they fall the caregiver descends the stairs carrying a child in front . the size of the child obscures the view of the subsequent stair ( fig . the momentum usually causes the caregiver and child to fall forward down the stairs ( fig . 2they miss the step and fall , often landing on the child as they fall they miss the step and fall , often landing on the child as they fall with a better understanding of this mechanism , the treating er physician can avoid routine skeletal surveys when the parent describes a plausible sequence , as we note above . finally , with awareness of this mechanism , prevention of these injuries may be possible . our recommendations are for the caregiver to hold on to the handrail while traversing the steps . in addition to using the handrail , the caretaker s view of the stairs should be unobstructed ( fig .  3 ) . this can be accomplished by positioning the child on the opposite side of the body to the handrail . we hope that these recommendations serve to remind healthcare providers as to the dangers of carrying children on stairways . at times this may be necessary , and can be performed safely if the proper precautions are taken.fig . in addition to using the handrail , the caretaker s view of the stairs should be unobstructed the caregiver should hold on to the handrail while traversing the steps . in addition to using the handrail , the caretaker s view of the stairs should be unobstructed in conclusion , a fall in a caregiver s arms while going down stairs can result in multiple orthopedic injuries , particularly to the lower extremity . the costs of treating these injuries are not insignificant , averaging nearly $ 7,000 , and the suspicion of child abuse can be both costly and unnecessary in the case of a true accident . while descending the stairs with a child in their arms , the caregiver should hold the child to the side so as not to obscure their vision of the step with one arm , ideally holding the handrail with the other .","backgroundthe purpose of this study was to describe fractures sustained by children and to analyze the associated costs when a caretaker falls down stairs while holding a child.materials and methodsbetween 2004 and 2012 , 16 children who sustained a fracture after a fall down stairs while being carried by a caregiver were identified . 
 parents / caregivers were interviewed to see how the fall occurred , and a cost analysis was performed.resultsthe average age of the patients was 14.5  months ( 751  months ) . 
 the lower extremity was involved in 15 of 16 fractures , with 8 involving the femur . 
 the majority were buckle fractures , but all diaphyseal femur fractures were spiral . 
 three patients required a reduction in the operating room . 
 all fractures healed with cast immobilization . 
 five patients underwent skeletal surveys , as the treating physicians were concerned about potential child abuse . 
 the average cost of treatment was $ 6785 ( range $ 94845,876 ) . 
 detailed histories from the caregivers showed that they  missed a step  due to the child being carried in front of the caregiver , obscuring their vision.conclusionsa fall in a caregiver s arms while going down stairs can result in multiple orthopedic injuries . 
 the costs of treating these injuries are not insignificant , and the suspicion of child abuse can be both costly and unnecessary in the case of a true accident . while descending the stairs with a child in their arms , the caregiver should hold the child to the side so as not to obscure their vision of the step with one arm , ideally holding the handrail with the other.level of evidenceiv case series .",335
"obesity is a major public health problem with over two - thirds of americans overweight and greater than one - third obese . while new data have suggested a leveling off of the prevalence of childhood obesity , 12.4% of kindergarteners are obese and overweight five - year olds are four times as likely as normal weight five - year olds to become obese [ 2 , 3 ] . it has been well documented that obesity leads to cardiac , metabolic , and other systemic health derangements . it has also been shown that these unfavorable changes may start as early as three years of age . well - child checks have long been recognized as opportunities to foster healthy growth and development . these regular visits , which are performed with a health care provider , traditionally occur during the newborn period , at one , two , four , six , nine , twelve , fifteen , eighteen , and twenty - four months and every year thereafter . the goal is to provide continuity of care and allow for anticipatory guidance to be given . recognizing that diet and nutrition are linked with obesity , it is important to address these topics . however , guidelines on nutrition counseling remain vague , and visit time is constrained by a multitude of other encouraged and essential components . yet studies show that when it comes to counseling during well - child checks , less is more and focusing on fewer topics is more effective . however , these are notably imprecise with regard to early and targeted interventions to prevent and treat obesity in pediatric populations . regarding nutrition counseling during well - child care within the first year of life , the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) bright future guidelines contains goals for temporal introduction of foods rather than composition of diet . even at the one - year visit , surprisingly , there is no mention of nutrition guidance at the fifteen- or eighteen - month well - child checks and it is not until the two - year visit that the subject of obesity is first addressed in the guidelines . meanwhile , research shows that a rapid transition occurs between the one- and two - year well - child checks , when diet habits seemingly shift to favor fast foods , with the french fry as the number one consumed vegetable consumed by two - year olds . the world health organization ( who ) strongly advocates for exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life and offers recommendations on complimentary feeding habits . these include continuing on - demand breastfeeding until two years of age and starting at 6 months of age , gradually increasing the number of feedings , consistency , and variety of other foods . for a nonbreastfed child , who further recommends providing four to five meals per day , with one or two healthy snacks aimed to meet the child 's nutritional needs . these who guidelines are appropriately aimed toward a global audience , with an emphasis on preventing malnutrition and ensuring adequate growth . current literature on prevention and treatment for obesity has overwhelmingly focused on adolescent and school aged populations . the aap recommends screening for obesity starting at two years , while united states preventive services task force ( uspstf ) suggests waiting until age six [ 7 , 10 ] . these recommendations bypass a likely window of opportunity for primary prevention prior to the second year of life , and  in the case of the uspstf  prior to six years . given these vague universal recommendations , we hypothesize that significant variability exists in clinical practice . it has been demonstrated that there is variability among pediatric primary care practices regarding obesity counseling , attitudes , and perceptions . some prior studies have focused on family medicine primary care providers ' ( pcps ) beliefs and practices pertaining to childhood obesity . however , many of these studies have placed emphasis more specifically on evaluation of treatment modalities , perception of obesity as a disease , and physician training [ 1318 ] . further , much of the previous work on childhood obesity appears directed beyond the age of five years , with few interventions studied between two and six years of age . this study builds upon the existing literature by offering a family medicine perspective and focusing specifically on perceived barriers and anticipatory guidance discussed at the early well - child checks  particularly those prior to the second year of life . this is further warranted as much of the current literature occurred prior to the updated 2008 aap bright futures guidelines [ 7 , 20 ] . given the recent emphasis on primary care and the likely influx of pediatric patients via the accountable care act , family physicians will continue to provide a substantial amount of care for pediatric populations . the goal of the present study is to assess the perception of family medicine pcps in a university based family medicine network surrounding the barriers of preventing and treating obesity in the young child and to analyze pcps reported behaviors at well - child checks . in addition , the present study allows for a comparison of attitudes and practice between family medicine pcps and pediatric pcps who participated in an earlier study using a similar survey . the sample included all family medicine physicians , physician assistants ( pas ) , and nurse practitioners ( nps ) at eleven family medicine duke primary care sites in duke university health systems . the survey used in the present study was developed based on a similar study performed in pediatric practices , current epidemiological literature , and recommendations from the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) and the united states preventive services task force ( uspstf ) [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] . previous authors were contacted for permission to utilize a similar survey tool . the survey contained three independent sections , each with a brief introduction . the sections were as follows : ( i ) perceived barriers in treating obesity , ( ii ) current pcp practices at well - child checks , and ( iii ) demographic information . introductory phone calls with follow - up emails were sent in january 2012 , prior to the in - person survey administration . an agreed upon morning or lunch hour time was arranged to include a ten- minute presentation explaining the goals of the project , with subsequent survey administration to all pcps who attended the meetings . an agreement was made to present the study findings to the participating sites at the conclusion of the study . data collection was performed during january and february 2012 and the data were analyzed in march 2012 . demographic data are presented as percentages / proportions . for questions related to perceived barriers , we calculated the percentage of respondents who indicated how important each issue was on a likert scale 15 ( not important , slightly important , moderately important , very important , and critically important ) , as well as the combined percentage of those who responded either very important ( 4 ) or critically important ( 5 ) . for pcp behaviors assessing anticipatory guidance , multiple responses were accepted ( i.e. , mark all well - child checks that apply ) . this study was reviewed by the research advisory board of the primary care research committee and the institutional review board of duke university and was found to be an exempt study ( pro00034169 ) . surveys were completed by 56 of the 78 family medicine pcps ( 41 family medicine physicians , 8 physician assistants , and 7 nurse practitioners ) at the 11 participating clinics , for a 72% response rate . approximately 1/3 ( 35% ) were 4049 years old , 1/3 ( 33% ) were 3039 , 27% were 50 + years old , and 5% were twenty through twenty - nine years old . the majority of pcps were medical doctors or doctors of osteopathic medicine ( md / do ) ( 73% ) , with physician assistants and nurse practitioners making up 14% and 13% , respectively . the average reported body mass index ( bmi ) of respondents was 24.71  kg / m ( 7 of the 54 respondents did not complete the bmi measures ) . approximately 1/3 ( 33% ) of the pcps were classified as overweight and 0.6% were in the obese category . reported bmi closely mirrored pcps perception of their weight , as 30% indicated they were overweight and 2% believed they were obese . pcps were asked to rate the relative importance of specific barriers to preventing or treating overweight or obese children . these questions related to children of all ages and focused on many factors including the child , parents , family unit , influence of society , and pcp factors . the five barriers that were most often rated as either very important or critically important were as follows : ( i ) families do not get enough exercise ( 93% ) ; ( ii ) families often have fast food meals ( 86% ) ; ( iii ) parent is not motivated to change diet or lifestyle ( 81% ) ; ( iv ) families watch too much tv ( 79% ) ; and ( v ) child is not motivated to change diet or lifestyle ( 75% ) ( table 1 ) . the following barriers were rated as very important or critically important by 6072% of pcps : parent is unaware that child is overweight , parents are overweight so they are not concerned that child is overweight , families are too busy to eat home cooked meals , healthy foods are too expensive , tv advertisements promote unhealthy foods , pcps have limited time to discuss nutrition , and pcps are frustrated with the low success rate of treating overweight children . barriers that pcps were less likely to rate as very important or critically important were as follows : overweight child does not act sick , overweight child is a  good eater , parents do not have time to shop for healthier foods , families are too busy to eat meals together , healthy lifestyle habits are too complicated to follow , published reports about diet and nutrition are often confusing , school lunches promote unhealthy eating habits , pcps ' time constraints , lack of training to treat overweight children , compensation for obesity treatment , access to nutritionists , and pcps ' weight status or body mass index ( table 1 ) . pcps were asked to mark all of the well - child checks in which they discuss a variety of health topics with patients . analyzing the barriers perceived by pcps as most important to preventing and treating obesity revealed trends regarding fast food consumption and physical inactivity . as shown in table 2 , even by their own report , most pcps did not discuss fast foods at or prior to the twelve - month visit . at the eighteen - month visit fast foods are discussed by 32% of pcps . meanwhile , the two - year visit is the first well - child visit at which the majority of pcps ( 68% ) discuss fast food . while the majority of pcps ultimately discuss this topic , the discussion is not undertaken by a majority of pcps at a specific encounter until the two- through five - year visits . fruit and vegetable discussion increases in frequency as the child ages , with a peak of 63% of pcps discussing this at the twelve - month visit , before dropping to 51% at the eighteen - month visit . between 22% and 26% of pcps discuss having 3 meals per day by the twelve - month visit , whereas 65% are discussing meal frequency at the two- through five - year visits . physical inactivity / exercise was another area of concern with 93% of pcps recognizing this as a contribution to obesity , yet this topic was discussed by at most 23% of pcps at and/or before the twelve - month visit . by the eighteen - month visit , at most 48% of pcps had ever discussed the topic with their patients or families . the two- through five - year visits are the first time at which the majority of pcps ( 68% ) discuss this topic . the percent of well - child visits where screen time is discussed closely mirrors physical activity / exercise , and a similar trend is seen regarding the discussion of fast foods ( table 2 ) . a major finding of the current study involved the relative importance pcps ascribe to perceived barriers in treating obesity . our results reproduced those of a previous study utilizing a similar survey but performed within a pediatric setting . our results confirm that family medicine pcps share the same top six concerns when dealing with perceptions surrounding obesity . these concerns center around physical inactivity , fast food consumption , and motivation to change . the barriers identified were in areas that were inconsistently addressed in practice , specifically prior to the two - year well - child check . despite the apparent lack of congruence between the identified barriers and the actions by pcps in clinical practice , furthermore , due to the self - reported nature , pcps may overestimate how often they address certain issues . a second major finding of the current study was the inconsistency pcps demonstrated concerning when discussion took place for physical activity , fruit and vegetable selection , screen time , juice , and other beverage choices . this study suggests that primary prevention interventions targeting obesity in practice are either misplaced or missed altogether in some cases , which is consistent with other recent studies demonstrating missed opportunity for primary prevention of obesity [ 2124 ] . as this study is representative of an academic practice population with close geographic proximity , further study on a larger scale and in other practice populations the aap recommendations make no mention of fruits and vegetables until the five- and six - year well - child visits . in another case , the aap guidelines suggest the discussion of having 3 meals per day at the nine- and twelve - month well - child checks . however , in this study , only 26% of pcps have this discussion specifically at or before the twelve - month well - child visit . interestingly 65% of pcps have this discussion at the two- through five - year well - child visits despite lack of specific recommendation to do so . pcps seem to be aware of existing guidelines but , in this example , delay the delivery . other than this specific recommendation at the five - year well - child visit , all of the earlier well - child visit nutrition and diet guidelines are relatively nonspecific regarding diet composition . this likely contributes toward the variability observed in this study , as many pcps chose to have discussions , such as fruits and vegetables , at differing well - child visits . therefore , we believe that it would be advantageous to the goals of obesity prevention and treatment to have early and targeted interventions that precede adoption of adverse lifestyle choices [ 2527 ] . although it is beyond the scope of this paper , innovative approaches in obesity treatment have been identified over the past decade [ 2830 ] . comparing this study of family medicine pcps with a similar study done with pediatric providers revealed some similarities in practice behavior . pcps behavior in both studies reflected the general aap anticipatory guidance guidelines pertaining to obesity [ 7 , 11 ] . however , the anticipatory guidance discussions were not consistently performed at specific visits in either study , with greater variability observed in this family practice study ( see table 2 ) . different methodologies were used in data collection , as the study for family medicine pcps was measured using a cumulative approach , whereas the pediatric study was measured at point of first intervention . in comparing these studies , we chose to use the most conservative estimates by summating the percentages of anticipatory guidance being discussed . for example , a single pcp may have indicated that they discussed fast food at both the four- and six - month visits . our study would count both of these as unique interventions being done by different pcps . consequently , these findings may offer a realistic representation or , otherwise , an overestimation of how often topics were discussed at well - child checks . the present study identifies discrepancies in pcps adherence to counseling guidelines for nutrition , exercise , and screen time . in regard to exercise and screen time , this study demonstrates similar increases in the percentage of pcps discussing these topics , with the majority doing so at the two- through five - year well - child checks , and a peak between the six- through eleven - year well - child checks . however , the aap guidelines suggest that a majority of pcps address each of these topics much earlier . it would be beyond the scope of this discussion to address all elements of the survey . therefore , the remainder of this discussion will focus on the results relevant to fast food counseling and nutrition and their role in obesity prevention . a surprising result from this study was that there is no clear consensus as to when pcps are having discussions about fast food . while a prior study indicated that 62% of pediatricians addressed fast foods at or prior to twelve - month well - child visits , this study shows that at most 39% of family physicians did so ( table 2 ) . these estimates suggest that there is still a large percentage of the population receiving no counseling on fast food during the entire first year of life . it is not until the two - year well - child visit that a majority of pcps discuss fast food . meanwhile , previous research has shown that there is a profound shift in dietary habits toward fast foods , such as french fries , that occurs between the one- and two - year well - child checks . to address fast food consumption , pcps could consider integrating a universal  french fry discussion  regularly at the twelve - month well - child care visit . given the recognition that food transitioning towards fast foods such as french fries occurs within the subsequent window from twelve months to twenty - four months , it might be beneficial to offer a specific intervention at this visit . furthermore , prior research has shown that a dedicated intervention targeting two - year olds and their families can significantly reduce bmi . the  french fry discussion  could take the form of a purposeful talk with family members about the importance of avoiding fast foods , fried foods , and sweetened beverages . for example , using motivational interviewing techniques has been shown to be effective in changing behavior relating to obesity , and this approach may address such a complex behavior [ 32 , 33 ] . this visit could additionally include handouts or printouts about alternative foods and snacks that are affordable and can be prepared quickly . rather , this should be an individualized discussion , in which family members are encouraged to voice their concerns and devise solutions that meet their unique situation . as such , we would not anticipate a discussion of this relevance requiring anything less than ten minutes of dedicated visit time . the goal of this discussion would be to leverage the patient - physician - family relationship to positively impact lifestyle choices for both the child and the family . further study is needed to examine actual obesity prevention and treatment guidelines in clinical practice and to discern the specifics , feasibility , and benefits of incorporating additional counseling into routine well - child care .","childhood obesity is a complex problem that warrants early intervention . 
 general recommendations for obesity prevention and nutrition counseling exist . 
 however , these are notably imprecise with regard to early and targeted interventions to prevent and treat obesity in pediatric populations . 
 this study examines family medicine primary care providers ' ( pcps ) perceived barriers for preventing and treating pediatric obesity and their related practice behavior during well - child visits 
 . methods . 
 a written survey addressing perceived barriers and current practices addressing obesity at well - child visits were administered to pcps at eleven family medicine clinics in the duke university health system . 
 results . 
 the most common perceived barriers identified by pcps to prevention or treatment of obesity in children were families not getting enough exercise ( 93% ) and families too often having fast food meals ( 86% ) . 
 most pcps do not discuss fast foods at or prior to the twelve - month well - child visit . 
 the two - year visit is the first well - child visit at which a majority of pcps ( 68% ) discuss fast food .   conclusion . 
 no clear consensus exists as to when pcps should discuss fast food in early well - child checks . 
 previous research has shown a profound shift in children 's dietary habits toward fast foods , such as french fries , that occurs between the one- and two - year well - child checks . 
 consideration should be given to having a  french fry discussion  at every twelve - month well - child care visit .",301
"access to water in the required quantity is needed to achieve good personal and domestic hygiene practices1 ; while good quality water ensures that ingested water does not constitute a health hazard , even in a life time of consumption2 . it is however estimated that as much as 1.1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water3 , while the drinking of contaminated water is responsible for 88% of the over four billion cases of diarrhoeal diseases that occur in the world every year , and the 1.8 million deaths that result from them . it is also indirectly responsible for the 50% of childhood malnutrition that is linked to diarrhoral diseases , and the 860 , 000 deaths that result from them each year4 the who estimates that 94% of diarrhoeal diseases are preventable through modifications to the environment4 , with improved access to safe drinking water alone able to reduce diarrhea episodes by between 20% and 35% , according to two systematic reviews56 . these health benefits , and the fact that a ready access to water saves the time of water drawers for more productive activities explain why access to adequate quantity of safe water was made one of the millennium development goals7 , and why it was recognized as one of the foundations of nigeria 's developmental efforts , by the national economic empowerment and development strategy ( needs ) document8 . target 10 , goal 7 of the millennium development goal sets a 2015 target to reduce the proportion of people without access to safe water by half7 ; while the 2005 national water and sanitation policy expects a 100% coverage by 20119 . these targets would however require extra effort to achieve in the rural riverine communities of the niger delta region , considering the enormous effort required to make the huge water resources in the communities safe for drinking . according to the 2008 national demographic and health survey , access to safe drinking water is still low in the rural communities of nigeria at 43.8% , which is likely to be worse in the rural riverine communities of the niger delta , because of the widespread use of overhung toilets in the communities , and the poor quality of groundwater , linked to saline intrusion and high concentration of iron , manganese and arsenic , as a result of the geology of the area10 . it was not known the extent target 10 , goal 7 of the mdg has been met in the communities , especially with the much publicized efforts of government and the oil companies in addressing the basic needs of the people of the niger delta . this study assessed the situation of the community water supply in 22 rural and semi - urban riverine communities in bayelsa and rivers states , in the niger delta ; as part of a baseline health impact assessment study conducted in the communities for a gas pipeline project . the report the findings and the recommendations of appropriate technologies that could be implemented to hasten the pace of meeting the mdg in the communities are hereby presented . this was a descriptive cross - sectional study using a structured interviewer - administered questionnaire , field observations and focus group discussions carried out in 21 communities , in four local government areas in south - south nigeria . a triangulation of the qualitative research techniques were used to help gain a deeper insight into the context of the water situation in the study communities . these communities had a population of about 150 , 000 people ( projected with the 2006 national census ) . the study set to detect a 5% difference in access to safe water , with an alpha error of 5% , acceptable beta error of 20% , and a statistical power of 80% ; and using the national average of access to safe water in rural communities of 43.8%11 . using the usual formula for sample size determination for descriptive studies12 the data were collected by the author and trained assistants and analysed for the type , operation , maintenance and functionality of water facilities , and the microbiological status of the water , using the membrane filtration technique , with escherichia coli as the indicator organism14 . the data were analyzed according to the standard method12 , and the results were considered to be significantly contaminated if they were found to be beyond the world health organisation ( who ) minimum acceptable values15 . the respondents had an average age of 29.20 + / 5.2 years ; most ( 89.69% ) had a secondary school education or less , and had spouses that were mostly engaged in fishing and farming ( 40.13% ) ( table 1 ) . the socio - demographic characteristics of study participants table 2 shows the water and sanitation facilities of the respondents . the most common source of drinking water was surface water ( 37.9% ) , with bottled / sachet water serving the needs of up to 19% of the households . household water and sanitation facilities most ( 61.2% ) of the drawers of water for the households spent less than 15 minutes to complete the round trip to the water sources , while most ( 60.8% ) of the households stored their drinking water in jerry cans . a lot ( 48% ) of the drinking water used by the households were not treated , even as only 12.72% of them used an improved sanitation facility , and the two - week period prevalence of diarrhea amongst them was 27% . the number and type of water supply facilities in the 22 study communities are shown in table 3 . there were a total of 374 community water supply facilities in the communities , an average of 17 per community , but only 89 ( 23.80% ) were functional as at the time of the study ; an average of 4.4 per community . only 46 ( 12.3% ) of the water facilities provided piped supply , though with very few household connections , with only 17 ( 36.96% ) of them functional as at the time of the study . the number and types of community water supply facilities in the study communities table 4 shows how the water facilities in the communities were provided . most ( 64.7% ) of the facilities were provided by government and its agencies like the niger delta development commission , but this included the protected hand - dug well constructed during the colonial and immediate post - colonial periods , and the hand - pumped well provided by several ad - hoc government water supply programmes . the sources of the community water facilities in the study communities the water facilities provided by the oil companies were either provided as part of their social responsibility to the communities , or as part of the remediation for an oil spill . those provided as part of the company 's social responsibility were mostly functional , mainly because they had functional committee for the maintenance of the facilities , though with most of the maintenance costs borne by the oil company . table 5 shows the results of the microbiological analysis of the water sample collected from various water sources in the communities . members of four of the communities had during the field study complained of the quality of water from their facilities , and some members had refused to drink from the facilities . the results of the microbiological analysis of the water sample collected from the various facilities in the communities more than two third ( 67.9% ) of the samples tested were found to contain significant numbers of escherichia coli ; especially the samples collected from surface water from which members of the communities routinely drank from . the study showed that the study communities were served by an average of 4.4 functional community water supply facilities , and that most of the inhabitants spent less than fifteen minutes to draw water from the facilities . this is consistent with the who recommendation of less than 15 minutes to and fro journey to the drinking water source , that ensures the provision of adequate quantity of water required to satisfy the drinking water and sanitation needs1316 . the situation in the study communities was also better than the figures obtained during the 2008 national demographic and health survey11 . according to the survey , only 71.9 % of nigerians residing in the rural areas had access to water within 30 minutes , compared to the 91% obtained in the study . the situation in the study communities was helped by the efforts of the oil companies operating in the communities who provided more than 30% of the community water facilities in the communities . however , as much as 76.2% of the community water facilities in the study communities were not functional as at the time of the study ( table iii ) . this has also been noted in other communities in nigeria17 ; and blamed on factors that include amongst others , the absence of a responsible body for the operation and maintenance of the facilities , and poor workmanship by dubious contractors17 . these factors were also noted in the study communities as most of the non - functional facilities were those provided by government and its agencies , without any arrangement for their maintenance and operation . on the other hand , facilities provided as part of an oil company 's social responsibility were found to be mostly functional , because they had functional committees constituted and funded for the operation and maintenance of the facilities . the non - functional water facilities forced 66% of the households into drawing their water from non - improved sources . this is worse than the national average for rural areas of 53.4%11 and very unhealthy considering that as high as 67.9% of the water facilities were found to have e.coli count higher than the who recommended level15 . it is also not surprising that the two week period prevalence in the communities was 26.97% , much higher than the 8.9% average for rural areas in nigeria . the quality of water in the communities can be improved not only by ensuring the functionality of the water facilities , but most importantly by encouraging the use of point - of - use water purification systems . the use of point - of - use water purification systems would fully tap the huge surface water resources in the communities , and particularly discourage the use of the expensive , but dubious bottle / sachet water that was used by19.08% of the households to satisfy their drinking water needs . point - of - use water purification systems have been found to deliver as much health benefits as an improved water source56 , and among the most cost - effective approaches in preventing diarrhoeal diseases18 . promoting the use of the point - of - use purification systems require a deliberate effort , especially because 48.03% of the households did not see the need to purify water of suspicious quality before drinking ; while up to 29% use alum and cloth filtration that are not particularly effective in disinfecting the water in the communities . even boiling that is often recommended has been found to fail under conditions of heavy faecal contamination as found in the study communities ; because of the ease with which household utensils are recontaminated19 . more social marketing activities would therefore be needed in the communities to specifically promote the use of the coagulant / chlorine combination that was used by just 5.92% of the households , but have been found to be very effective520 . members of four of the study communities had complained of the quality of water from their facilities . this is probably related to the high iron and manganese content of the water , as indicated by a previous study in the niger delta10 . also , the fact that most of the water facilities in the communities had elaborate water treatment facilities points to the enormity of the problem posed by the high inorganic content of the ground water . the type of technology used to deal with the poor quality ground water is probably inappropriate , and responsible for the high level of non - functionality of the water facilities . the sustainable use of the water facilities therefore lies in adopting an appropriate technology that can address the need , yet simple enough to be operated and repaired by readily available expertise21 . there are already several low - cost and rugged technologies that can be applied at household and community levels in the communities for the treatment of water with high inorganic content2223 ; such technologies should as a matter of urgency be adopted and promoted in the communities . the communities had easy access to water supply , but most of the facilities were either contaminated or nonfunctional . the operation and management of the facilities by members of the communities , and the promotion of point - of - use purification systems are hereby advocated .","background : water is a fundamental human need . 
 this is the basis for target 10 , goal 7 of the millennium development goals which sets to reduce the proportion of people without access to safe water by half by 2015 . 
 this study assessed the access to safe water supply in 22 riverine communities in the niger delta region of nigeria.materials and method : the study was carried out using a descriptive cross - sectional study design , with the data collected using a structured interviewer - administered questionnaire , field observations and focused group discussions . 
 the questionnaire was administered to female heads of household , and used to collect information on the main source of drinking water , the time it took for the round trip to the main water sources , and methods used for the treatment of water of suspicious quality . 
 an inventory of all the community water facilities in the communities was also taken , and information collected on the functionality of the facilities , and how they were constructed , operated and maintained . 
 a sample of the water from each of the facilities was also collected in a sterile container for microbiological analysis.results:a total of 456 questionnaires were administered and retrieved . 
 the most common source of drinking water was surface water ( 37.9% ) , and most ( 61.2% ) of the water drawers spent less than 15 minutes to complete the round trip to the water sources . 
 there were an average of 17 community water supply facilities , but only 23.8% of the facilities were functional during the study . 
 most of the functional facilities were being managed by community members . 
 more than two third ( 67.9% ) of the samples tested were found to contain significant numbers of escherichia coli.conclusion:the communities had easy access to water supply , but most of the facilities were either contaminated or nonfunctional . 
 the management of the facilities by members of the communities , and the promotion of point - of - use purification systems are hereby advocated .",398
"anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog .","research on the implications of anxiety in parkinson 's disease ( pd ) has been neglected despite its prevalence in nearly 50% of patients and its negative impact on quality of life . 
 previous reports have noted that neuropsychiatric symptoms impair cognitive performance in pd patients ; however , to date , no study has directly compared pd patients with and without anxiety to examine the impact of anxiety on cognitive impairments in pd . 
 this study compared cognitive performance across 50 pd participants with and without anxiety ( 17 pda+ ; 33 pda ) , who underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment . 
 group performance was compared across the following cognitive domains : simple attention / visuomotor processing speed , executive function ( e.g. , set - shifting ) , working memory , language , and memory / new verbal learning . 
 results showed that pda+ performed significantly worse on the digit span forward and backward test and part b of the trail making task ( tmt - b ) compared to the pda group . 
 there were no group differences in verbal fluency , logical memory , or tmt - a performance . in conclusion , 
 anxiety in pd has a measurable impact on working memory and attentional set - shifting .",246

( a high - quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue . ) several lines of evidence indicate that the number and function of epcs are impaired in diabetes ( 17,19 ) and that these events rely mainly on nox - mediated ros production ( 15 ) . the effect of in vivo uag and ag administration in protecting both cacs and epcs from oxidative damage was first evaluated . toward this end , cells isolated from uag- or ag - treated individuals with type 2 diabetes and healthy subjects were characterized for cac and epc markers ( supplementary fig . 1 ) ( 18 ) and subjected to dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence assay . the results reported in fig . 1a and b demonstrate that uag , but not ag , treatment ( 6 h ) drastically reduced ros production in individuals with type 2 diabetes . moreover , the number of viable cells was significantly higher after uag treatment compared with before ( fig . a protective effect of uag on ros production was also demonstrated in cells cultured with age or high glucose ( supplementary fig . these findings , together with the observation that neither in vitro nor in vivo uag administration ( supplementary fig . 2c and d ) changed age receptor ( rage ) expression , suggest that effector(s ) downstream of rage is the target for protective effect of uag . because similar results were obtained after 12 h of treatment ( data not shown ) , data throughout the study relates to 6-h uag treatment . a and b : dichlorofluorescein diacetate assay was performed on cacs or epcs , recovered from healthy subjects ( ncacs , nepcs ) or from diabetic patients ( dcacs , depcs ) treated with saline , uag , or ag ( white area : no treatment ;

( a high - quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue . ) the present data first demonstrate that uag , unlike ag , reverts diabetes - induced epc damage by inhibiting activation of the nox regulatory protein rac1 ; as a consequence , uag protects diabetic epcs from senescence and improves their vasculogenic capability ; again , only uag rescues epc mobilization under diabetic conditions by restoring enos phosphorylation , and specific uag - binding sites mediate its effects . uag is the most abundant circulating form of ghrelin ( 3 ) and plays a positive role on glucose metabolism . in contrast , basic and clinical studies have proposed ag as a diabetogenic hormone ( 8,38 ) . indeed , clinical conditions of insulin resistance are associated with an alteration in the circulating ghrelin profile with relative ag excess with respect to uag ( 12 ) . thus , it is tempting to speculate that an altered uag / ag ratio might contribute both to metabolic changes and to diabetes - associated complications . among diabetes - associated complications , abnormal vascular remodeling is believed to play a major role in accelerating vascular disease ( 39 ) . historically , it has been assumed that new blood vessels originate from sprouting cells and co - opting of neighboring preexisting vessels . however , both physiological and pathologic angiogenesis are also supported by mobilization and recruitment of other cell types , including the bone marrow  derived cells , such as epcs ( 16,18,40,41 ) . interestingly , alterations in the number and function of these cells correlate with the risk factor profile ( 19,20 ) . overproduction of ross in these pathologic settings seems to contribute to impaired vascular regenerative processes ( 42 ) . the plasma membrane nox is recognized as one of the major regulators of ros generation ( 15,29 ) . activation of the enzyme can occur via many upstream signaling pathways converging on phosphorylation of p47 and activation of rac1 leading to the oxidase assembly ( 29 ) . our study shows that uag can protect diabetic epcs from oxidative stress by affecting the nox regulatory protein rac1 . the accelerated onset of senescence contributes to the impaired epc bioavailability in patients with diabetes ( 17 ) . the tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor involved in dna damage mechanisms and is recognized as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in human atherosclerotic and restenosis lesions ( 43 ) . moreover , the p53-mediated pathway contributes to epc senescence - like growth arrest in diabetes ( 44 ) . accordingly , the present study shows that silencing p53 in epcs isolated from individuals with type 2 diabetes or cultured with age prevents both ros production and senescence . the finding that both in vitro and in vivo exposure to uag negatively modulates p53 accumulation identifies the p53-mediated signal as the primary mechanism through which uag protects epcs from senescence . we also found that , by preventing oxidative stress , uag improves de novo vessel formation . the efficacy of cell therapy certainly depends on the number , functional capability , and successful retention of cells in the site of action . thus , our data strongly suggest that naturally occurring uag induces improvement of epc function and survival that may translate into a more efficient response to vascular dysfunction . senescence is also associated with impaired mobilization of bone marrow  derived cells ( 17 ) . the molecular interactions between stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells , and the molecular mechanisms controlling their mobilization in the bone marrow microenvironment , are poorly understood ( 45 ) . considerable interest has arisen about agents able to mobilize and augment progenitor cell delivery to sites of vascular injury to enhance revascularization . among these , sdf-1 and vegf are recognized as primary regulators of bone marrow cell mobilization during stress conditions ( 22,46 ) . in addition , under physiological stresses , the activation of matrix proteases within the bone marrow microenvironment results in the release of skitl , which enables endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor cells to transit from the quiescent to the proliferative niche and facilitates their mobilization into the circulation ( 22 ) . the delivery of progenitor cells to sites of neovascularization also relies on functional enos activity ( 23 ) . indeed , in pathologic settings associated with blunted enos activity and reduced systemic no bioavailability , defective epc mobilization and impaired vascular regenerative processes occur ( 24,25 ) . enos activation through akt has been reported for ag acting on the gq - coupled ghs - r1a in cultured endothelial cells ( 47 ) . we herein demonstrate that uag can restore enos activity via akt - mediated phosphorylation in a pathologic setting characterized by impaired enos phosphorylation . such an event was found crucial to epc bone marrow mobilization , because uag had no effect in enos knockout mice . we also showed that enos phosphorylation , occurring in response to uag , is associated with mmp9 activation and possibly with the release of skitl , as suggested by the reduced expression of the mbkitl on stromal cells recovered from uag - treated mice and by functional studies . although we can not exclude that uag may act in a paracrine manner by locally inducing the release of vegf from bone marrow stromal cells , we demonstrate that short - term treatment with uag , but not ag , of bone marrow cells in vitro leads to akt and enos phosphorylation and that , in vivo , these events are associated with mmp9 activation and epc mobilization . furthermore , uag , unlike ag , strongly induced epc mobilization in individuals with type 2 diabetes , but not in nondiabetic subjects . notably , no change in serum concentrations of primary mobilization factors was detected after uag or ag systemic administration . in addition , our results shed light on the earliest molecular events leading to uag- but not ag - mediated physiological regulation of epc bioavailability . indeed , we showed that epcs possess specific uag - binding sites , which are not recognized by ag . in addition to ghs - r1a , which is the ag - specific receptor ( 3 ) , other ghrelin receptor subtypes exist , whose molecular identities have not yet been characterized , but that recognize both ag and uag ( 3 ) . thus , our data provide the first evidence of the existence of uag - specific binding sites and of their relevance in human - derived epcs , which could represent a novel target for pharmacological modulation . preclinical and clinical studies generally support the therapeutic potential of autologous epcs in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases , such as tissue ischemia and myocardial infarction ( 49 ) . however , epc mobilization may also accelerate atherosclerotic plaque progression ( 50 ) and induce tumor ( 51 ) or retina ( 52 ) neovascularization in individuals with type 2 diabetes . nonetheless , therapies with statins , the main epc mobilization mediators ( 53 ) , revealed no concerns in terms of neovascularization . we now have reason to believe that the significant epc mobilization potential of uag , and the lack of its effects on serum levels of sdf-1 and vegf , may be exploited for clinical treatment of diabetes- and atherosclerosis - induced vascular impairment . in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes , epc availability is reduced , restricting the possibility of treating patients in need with directed / cell - based therapies . besides displaying a positive influence on -cell viability and glucose homeostasis ( 3 ) , uag mobilizes epcs , protects epcs from oxidative stress and from senescence , and increases de novo vessel formation ( see model in fig . this suggests that uag - related peptides or uag receptor  specific agonists may be further developed into lead compounds from the perspective of a novel pharmacologic intervention to ameliorate both metabolic control and impaired vascular growth in individuals with type 2 diabetes where ag has failed . the resident bone marrow pool of early and late epcs was mobilized into circulation after uag - mediated akt activation in stromal cells , which leads to enos phosphorylation and mmp9 activation . in turn , mmp9 activation switched on the release of skitl , a determinant for epc exit into the bloodstream . in addition , uag treatment restores diabetic viability of epcs and increases their vasculogenic capability by preventing ros generation and its downstream signaling pathway ( p53 accumulation , p21 expression , rb phosphorylation ) . this effect results from uag - mediated inhibition of rac1 activation , a prerequisite for nadph oxidase assembly .","objectiveacylated ghrelin ( ag ) is a diabetogenic and orexigenic gastric polypeptide . 
 these properties are not shared by the most abundant circulating form , which is unacylated ( uag ) . an altered uag / ag profile together with an impairment of circulating endothelial progenitor cell ( epc ) bioavailability 
 were found in diabetes . 
 based on previous evidence for the beneficial cardiovascular effects of ag and uag , we investigated their potential to revert diabetes - associated defects.research design and methodshealthy human subjects , individuals with type 2 diabetes , and ob / ob mice were ag or uag infused . 
 epc mobilization in patients and mice was evaluated , and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated in bone marrow stromal cells . 
 recovered epcs were also evaluated for the activity of senescence regulatory pathways and for nadph oxidase activation by knocking down p47phox and rac1 . 
 finally , uag modulation of human epc vasculogenic potential was investigated in an in vivo mouse model.resultsneither ag nor uag had any effect in healthy subjects . however , systemic administration of uag , but not ag , prevented diabetes - induced epc damage by modulating the nadph oxidase regulatory protein rac1 and improved the vasculogenic potential both in individuals with type 2 diabetes and in ob / ob mice . 
 in addition , unlike ag , uag facilitated the recovery of bone marrow epc mobilization . 
 crucial to epc mobilization by uag was the rescue of endothelial no synthase ( enos ) phosphorylation by akt , as uag treatment was ineffective in enos knockout mice . 
 consistently , epcs expressed specific uag - binding sites , not recognized by ag.conclusionsthese data provide the rationale for clinical applications of uag in pathologic settings where ag fails .",376
"rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is an obstinate , systemic inflammatory disease which has a negative impact on the quality of life.1 anti - tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) therapy has proved to be beneficial to ra patients because it can suppress inflammation and joint damage;2 therefore , the percentage of ra patients treated with ant - tnf agents is steadily increasing . adalimumab ( ada ) , a fully human anti - tnf monoclonal antibody , exhibits excellent effectiveness in ra ; however , its use has been reported to cause many adverse events in ra patients . tnf is an important cytokine involved in initiating a protective immune response ; therefore , patients receiving this therapy may be at a high risk of infection . legionella pneumophila is a fastidious intracellular gram - negative bacillus that requires special microbiological culture media . , however , it seems that the risk of l. pneumophila pneumonia may be increasing in ra patients receiving tnf antagonist therapy.3 we report a rare case of pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila in an ra patient after only two ada injections . this report suggests a possible association between the use of ada and the incidence of pneumonia , which is a severe and often fatal infection . a seventy - eight - year - old japanese woman with seropositive ra , diagnosed in 1998 based on the acr 1987 criteria , underwent sulphasalazine ( sasp ) therapy before she visited our institute . in 2008 she was started on methotrexate ( mtx ) and low - dose prednisolone ( psl ) therapies . despite administration of low - dose therapies of mtx ( 6 mg / week ) , sasp ( 500 mg / day ) , and psl ( 2.5 mg / day ) , because of her age and history of drug intolerance , her ra disease activity remained high [ tender joint count , 4/28 , and swollen joint count , 11/28 ; patient global assessment score , 72 mm/100 mm ; c - reactive protein ( crp ) , 2.55 mg / dl ; erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , 52 mm / hour ; matrix metalloproteinase- 3 , 71.7 ng / ml ; and disease activity score 28-esr , 5.82 ] . furthermore , she had pulmonary emphysema and slight fibrosis in her bilateral lower lungs , and her sister had previously suffered from tuberculosis . however , the patient had no other lung diseases , including tuberculosis ( negative result on the tuberculin test quanti - feron ) , no medical history of any viral infection , was not a hepatitis b virus carrier , and showed normal serum kl-6 and beta - d - glucan levels ( 410 u / ml and < 2.84 pg / ml , respectively ) . therefore , we decided to include anti - tnf therapy along with her current therapy after giving isoniazid ( inh ) 300 mg / day for three months . ada at a dose of 40 mg was introduced in addition to mtx ( 6 mg / week ) , sasp ( 500 mg / day ) , psl ( 2.5 mg / day ) , and folic acid ( 5 mg / week ) in june 2011 . she experienced excellent pain relief in her joints after her first subcutaneous ada injection , with no immediate adverse effects ; her second injection was therefore safely administered two weeks after her first injection . eight days after her second ada injection , she had fever ( 38.6 c ) , fatigue , and bloody sputum for two consecutive days ; thereafter , she was admitted to our hospital . at that time , we first heard that she regularly visited a public bath and had continued to do so after ada treatment . on admission ( day 0 , 8 days after her second ada injection ) , her body temperature was 38.6 c and she was slightly tachycardic ( 96 beats / minute ) with a blood pressure of 142/68 mmhg . her heart sounds were normal , and she had neither chest pain nor visible rash . however , coarse crackles were audible in her right lower lung , and oxygen monitoring showed hypoxemia ( spo2 , 92% ) . her joints were not swollen , painful , or warm , so we did not consider this state as a flare of ra . on the other hand , laboratory data showed marked acute inflammation ( crp , 27.05 mg / dl ; white blood cell count , 20,600/mm ) and a positive urine l. pneumophila antigen test ( binax , portland , or , usa ) . however , her serum beta - d - glucan levels were normal ( < 3.30 pg / ml ) . in addition , her expectoration culture , collected two days later , was weakly positive for haemophilus influenzae ( blnar ) . chest x - ray showed a permeation shadow in her right lower lung , and chest computed tomography ( ct ) showed pleural thickening , light ground glass opacities ( ggos ) right under the pleura , and consolidation with an air bronchogram in the right s6 , s9 , and s10 segments without fibrotic change from her baseline lung ( fig . the patient was clinically diagnosed with pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila affecting her originally fibrotic ra lungs . she was then admitted and given intravenous pazufloxacin ( pzfx ) 1000 mg / day ( after an initial administration of 2 g twice daily at days 0 and 1 ) for 10 consecutive days . she showed remarkable recovery after being injected with pzfx and was discharged on day 10 . after discharge from our hospital , we confirmed her seroconversion of l. pneumophila and complete healing of pneumonia on chest ct . mtx ( 6 mg / week ) and psl ( 5 mg / day ) therapies were then restarted without ada because of an increase in her ra disease activity at day 20 . however , pneumonia relapsed at day 55 along with loss of appetite , fatigue , and coughing . laboratory data showed acute inflammation ( crp , 13.09 mg / dl ; white blood cell count , 10,500/mm ) , and her urine l. pneumophila antigen test ( binax ) was again positive . in addition , both her serum kl-6 and beta - d - glucan levels were high ( 815 u / ml and 29.56 pg / ml , respectively ) unlike before . blood gas data showed severe hypoxemia ( po2 , 47.5 mmhg ; pco2 , 29.5 mmhg ) . chest ct findings showed multifocal consolidation with ggo extending to the bilateral lower aggravated fibrotic lungs ( fig . 2a and b ) unlike pneumocystis pneumonia ( pcp ) , which mostly showed diffuse ggo of the bilateral lungs . furthermore , neither dna of pneumocystis jiroveci from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( balf ) nor serum cryptococcus and aspergillus antigens were positive . we could not detect any bacteria from her balf culture . on the other hand , serum candida antigen and culture of candida albicans were positive . on the basis of these findings , we diagnosed a relapse of l. pneumophila pneumonia with deep mycosis ( eg , candida infection ) and interstitial pneumonia ( ip ) . the patient s lungs were previously affected by ra , but not pcp . unfortunately , although we tried every possible treatment , the patient eventually died of aggravated ip on day 79 ( kl-6 , 5030 u / ml ; beta - d - glucan , 8.05 pg / ml at day 72 ) . ada , a fully human anti - tnf monoclonal antibody , has been used in japan since june 2008 for the treatment of ra and is administered at 40 mg once every 2 weeks or at 80 mg for cases of high disease activity which do not respond to 40 mg use . it is known to be very effective in decreasing inflammation , such as that in ra . however , it is also known that anti - tnf therapy may be a risk factor for a number of infections ; in particular , ada treatment is considered a risk factor for reactivation of latent tuberculosis.46 anti - tnf agents including ada are said to be risk factors for bacterial pneumonia.7,8 in addition , ra disease severity in itself is known to be one of the strongest risk predictors of infection.9 as mentioned above , patients treated with anti - tnf agents are generally believed to be at an increased risk of bacterial infections.10 conversely , another study found that the severity of serious infections was not increased in anti - tnf - treated patients compared with a disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs ( dmard)-treated cohort.11 considering the risks associated with the use of anti - tnf agents , we restrict their administration and occasionally exclude immunocompromised patients with co - morbidities , such as those with diabetes mellitus , heart disease , viral hepatitis , and lung disease , or elderly patients from these treatments . our patient was a 78-year - old woman with ra , who had a long - term smoking habit and had bilateral fibrotic lungs ; these were possibly be risk factors for legionella infection in patient as well as other infections such as pcp . legionellosis presents as two types of diseases ; one is legionnaires disease , the more severe form , and the other is pontiac fever , the milder form , which shows minimal heat and muscular pain , and has a rapid complete recovery.12 legionellos is also often presents as pneumonia and is mainly caused by the l. pneumophila serogroup 1 ( sg1 ) , a ubiquitous , opportunistic , gram - negative intracellular pathogen.3 tnf induces differentiation of monocytes into macrophages , which are essential in the induction of granuloma , and is important for maintaining the integrity of granuloma.13 in addition , tnf plays an important role in host resistance against infectious agents , especially those multiplying intracellularly.14 thus , treatment with tnf antagonists is associated with an increased risk of infection , particularly infections caused by intracellular microorganisms such as l. pneumophila . in contrast , in japanese post - marketing surveillance with tnf antagonists for ra , both fatal and surviving cases of legionella pneumonia were reported to be very rare ( infliximab , 1 and 0 in 7522 cases ; etanercept , 0 and 0 in 13894 cases ; ada , 3 and 2 in 3084 cases , respectively ) . legionella pneumonia tends to be a severe and fatal form of community - acquired pneumonia very similar to pneumococcal pneumonia . nowadays , however , l. pneumophila pneumonia is considered to be a curable disease if appropriate antimicrobial therapy is administered at an early stage . usually , legionellosis is considered to be caused by inhalation of aerosols containing l. pneumophila and bathing in hot springs and circulation - type bathtubs available in public bathing facilities that are infected with l. pneumophila . but further investigations showed that her case was an isolated infection and was not part of a mass outbreak , suggesting that l. pneumophila infection in our patient was more likely caused after ada treatment . nowadays in japan , both the introduction of the urinary legionella antigen test and improvements in the  infectious disease law have led to an increase in the number of reports of l. pneumophila . accordingly , milder cases of legionella pneumonia have been reported . in the past , many cases of legionellosis might have been overlooked , including milder cases of legionella pneumonia or minor pontiac fever . winthrop - university hospital criteria are said to be very useful for discriminating fairly well between l. pneumophila pneumonia and bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia , at the time of hospitalization , for community - acquired pneumonia.15 chest ct findings of legionella pneumonia are said to be bilateral or unilateral with single and multifocal consolidation and ggo,16 while those of mild legionella pneumonia are said to be bilateral , with multiple affected segments and peripheral lung consolidation with ggo.17l . pneumophila includes 16 types of serogroups , and only sg1 can be detected by the urine l. pneumophila antigen test ( binax ) . the percentage of l. pneumophila sg1 may be high in japan , as it is in a lot of countries , but we are unable to detect all l. pneumophila by this antigen test . urine l. pneumophila antigen test may be positive for a few weeks after treatment of legionella pneumonia as seen in this case ; however , we diagnosed this case as a recurrence of l. pneumophila pneumonia with deep mycosis ( eg , candida infection ) and ip on the basis of data from serum , culture , balf analysis , and ct scans , which showed multifocal consolidation with ggo extending to the lower parts of her fibrotic lungs bilaterally at recurrence ( fig . the risk of l. pneumophila pneumonia is reported to increase in patients receiving tnf antagonists , with a relative risk of 16.521 , compared with that in the overall population in france.3 the use of corticosteroids and mtx might also have played a role in the emergence of this infection , but the patient had been treated with these medications for a long time . legionella tends to colonize the respiratory tract of immune - compromised patients and causes severe health problems once their immune system is further affected.18 in our case , because the patient did not visit any public bath after discharge from our hospital , it is possible that although she initially recovered from l. pneumophila pneumonia and was discharged from the hospital , the organism was still present in her respiratory tract , causing pneumonia to recur and ultimately prove fatal . in such cases , it is important to prevent tuberculosis by inh , pcp by trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole , and pneumococcal pneumonia by vaccination , in all immune - compromised ra patients before the first treatment with anti - tnf agents ; additionally , it is important to carefully monitor ra patients who have been given anti - tnf agents in the past , not only in the early phase when they are first given tnf inhibitors , but also afterwards , especially after they have recovered from infections such as that described in our case . to our knowledge , this is the first reported fatality triggered by relapsing pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila with deep mycosis and ip in an ra patient treated with ada . the patient eventually died of aggravated ip following a relapse of pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila . to avoid exacerbation of a patient s illness and to prevent fatality due to severe infection , it is important for us to be aware of the fact that the use of tnf - inhibitors can lead to infections such as that described here . because a delay in controlling some infections worsens the patient s ra disease activity during that period , it is important to control any infection rapidly and completely . recently , ra treatment has been rapidly and aggressively adopted based on the concept of  treat - to - target  ; therefore , we need both to accumulate evidence from case studies to promote safe and effective treatments for ra , and to avoid therapeutic errors , which will result in the maximum possible survival of patients .","we present a rare fatal case of relapsing pneumonia caused by legionella pneumophila in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis after only two injections of adalimumab . 
 a 78-year - old japanese woman with a 14-year history of rheumatoid arthritis was prescribed adalimumab because her disease activity remained high . 
 however , 8 days after her second injection of adalimumab , she was admitted to our hospital and diagnosed with pneumonia caused by l. pneumophila . following intravenous antibiotic therapy 
 , she recovered completely from pneumonia and was discharged on day 10 , but pneumonia relapsed , resulting in death 79 days after the first episode of pneumonia . 
 l. pneumophila can lead to recurrence of pneumonia that can ultimately prove fatal , similar to the present case . 
 a review of the pertinent literature is also presented .",171
"nucleotide excision repair ( ner ) plays a central role in preserving the genome of prokaryotes and eukaryotes . this versatile repair system removes structurally and chemically diverse bulky dna lesions , including those induced by exposure to uv light and environmental chemical carcinogens [ 1 , 2 ] . the vital importance of this mechanism is demonstrated by several human ner - deficiency syndromes including xeroderma pigmentosum ( xp ) , cockayne syndrome ( cs ) , and trichothiodystrophy ( ttd ) . xp , for example , is characterized by high photosensitivity , hyperpigmentation , premature skin ageing , and proneness to developing skin cancer . furthermore , the capacity of the ner pathway is important in cancer chemotherapy : ner diminishes   the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin , which act via the formation of bulky dna adducts . a better understanding of the mechanisms of recognition of dna lesions by the ner system may lead to the design of improved chemotherapeutic drugs that can modulate the repair response . recent findings reveal that polymorphisms in human ner repair genes have an impact on the repair of dna lesions and cancer   susceptibility [ 6 , 7 ] , as well as on chemotherapeutic efficacy . the eukaryotic ner pathway is a biologically complicated process and consists of two sub - pathways with different substrate specificity :   global genome ner ( gg - ner ) [ 9 , 10 ] and transcription - coupled repair ( tcr ) [ 1114 ] . both sub - pathways consist of ordered multistep processes , which differ in the early steps , when the dna lesions are recognized , but converge in the later steps .   in gg - ner , the focus of our present interest , the whole genome is scanned for bulky lesions to initiate the repair process . two independent complexes , one involving the xpc / hr23b / centrin 2 proteins [ 1517 ] and the other involving the ddb1/ddb2 heterodimer [ 1821 ] , have been implicated in the early steps of base - damage recognition during ner . by contrast , the tcr sub - pathway is activated by a stalled rna polymerase during transcription . once the lesion is detected , the two sub - pathways proceed in an essentially identical manner to excise it :   the multisubunit transcription factor . tfiih , containing helicases xpb , and xpd , is recruited to the lesion site , followed by xpa , the single - strand dna binding protein rpa , and the two nucleases xpg and xpf - ercc1 . once assembled , a 2432 oligonucleotide stretch containing the lesion is excised from the damaged strand . finally , gap resynthesis by dna polymerases  ,  , and    and ligation by dna ligase i complete the ner process . one remarkable characteristic of the ner pathway is its ability to excise an astounding variety of chemically and structurally diverse lesions , and the rates of repair can vary over several orders of magnitude . however , the differences in the structural and thermodynamic properties of the lesions that control the diverse ner efficiencies have remained elusive .   it has been suggested that the ner factors do not recognize the lesion itself , but rather the local distortions and destabilizations in the dna that are associated with it [ 2430 ] .   a number of different properties of damaged dna that elicit the ner response have been proposed . these   include disruption of watson - crick hydrogen bonding [ 24 , 31 ] , kinks in the damaged dna ,   thermodynamic destabilization [ 24 , 29 , 33 ] , diminished base stacking [ 34 , 35 ] , local conformational flexibility , and flipped - out bases in the unmodified complementary strand [ 3740 ] .   a crystal structure of   yeast rad4/rad23 , the homolog of the human ner recognition factor xpc / hr23b , bound to dna containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer , shows that rad4/rad23 inserts a -hairpin through the dna duplex and expels two mismatched thymines in the undamaged strand out of the duplex to bind with the enzyme   ( pdb i d : 2qsg ) . this structure suggests that lesions which thermodynamically destabilize the dna duplex and facilitate the flipping of base pairs and the intrusion of the beta - hairpin are good substrates to the ner machinery :   the more locally destabilized the lesion , the better it is repaired . the modulation of ner susceptibility for the same lesion by neighboring base sequence context , is however , a relatively unexplored area . if a lesion is better repaired in one sequence context than the other , a lesion - induced mutational hotspot could result .   in order to elucidate the relationship between ner efficiency and base sequence - governed dna distortion and destabilization induced by a bulky dna adduct , we have employed as a model system the major lesion derived from the cancer - causing compound benzo[a]pyrene ( b[a]p ) . b[a]p is the most well - studied member in a family of ubiquitous environmental pollutants known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . the tumorigenic metabolite of b[a]p   is the diol epoxide r7 , t8-dihydroxy - t9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( b[a]pde ) . this intermediate reacts with dna and rna ; the most abundantly stable adduct produced in mammalian cells [ 4446 ] is the 10s ( + ) -trans - anti - b[a]p - n - dg adduct ( [ g * ] ) ( figure 1(a ) ) , the focus of our work .   this adduct , unless removed by dna repair mechanisms , is highly mutagenic [ 48 , 49 ] . we have investigated the identical 10s ( + ) -trans - anti - b[a]p - n - dg adduct in the six sequence contexts shown in figure 1(b ) , utilizing an array of approaches :   ner in human hela cell extracts , ligation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques to assess bending properties of the modified duplexes , and structural studies utilizing high resolution nmr methods as well as unrestrained molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . the position of the b[a]p ring system in the b - dna minor groove , directed 5 along the modified strand , was first determined by nmr in the 5-  c[g*]c - i  sequence in 1992 , but sequence - governed structural details as well as dynamic properties remained to be elucidated .   one important motivation   for our work   was to explore the role of nearby guanine amino groups on the structural properties and ner susceptibilities of these duplexes . the key difference in these duplexes is the presence and positioning of guanines flanking the [ g * ] , either immediately adjacent to the lesion or beyond :   the b[a]p rings compete for space   with the bulky amino group of guanine on the minor groove side of b - dna , which we anticipated would differentially impact the structures of the damaged duplexes in a sequence context - dependent manner .   a further motivation was to explore the role of differing sequence contexts beyond the lesion that vary in intrinsic flexibility . we hypothesized that subtle but critical structural effects governed by sequence context would manifest themselves by impacting ner efficiencies . our results determined that sequence context could cause an up to four - fold difference in relative ner susceptibility , with even distant neighbors influencing ner . locally disturbed watson - crick hydrogen bonding and flexible bending are two key sequence - governed structural distortions caused by this lesion that the ner machinery appears to recognize with different efficiencies .   more generally , different lesions in varied sequence contexts will cause different kinds of distortions ; thus , the extent of the local thermodynamic destabilization will also vary ; we hypothesize that it is the extent and type of destabilization that determines the relative ner efficiency . the 5-  c[g * ]  , 5-  g[g * ] c  , and 5-  i[g * ]  sequences . high resolution nmr solution studies have shown that the bulky aromatic b[a]p residue is positioned in the minor groove on the 5-side of [ g * ]   in the 5-  c[g*]g  and 5-  g[g*]c  duplexes ( figure 2 ) .   however , there are sequence - governed differences in some of the structural features . duplex ,   nmr studies revealed that the c  :  g base pair on the 5-side of [ g * ] is severely disturbed . in the case of the sequence - isomer 5-  g[g*]c  duplex , this perturbance is not observed . on the other hand , analyses of md simulations [ 51 , 52 ] based on the nmr data revealed significant   unwinding near the lesion site combined with an anomalously enlarged roll ( figure 3 ) , not observed in the 5-  c[g*]g  duplex . duplex , which is a manifestation of a kink    that is highly flexible . this flexible bend is caused on a molecular level by the severe untwisting and enlarged roll determined by md from the nmr data : dna bending is largely caused by increased roll , which is correlated with untwisting [ 5557 ] . the underlying structural reasons for the disturbed watson - crick hydrogen bond in the 5- , the bulky amino group on g20 ( figure 3 ) , which is partner to the c on the 5 side of [ g * ] , is sterically crowded by the b[a]p ring system since both are on the minor groove side , and hence this c5  :  g20 base pair is episodically denatured ( figure 3(a ) ) ;   for the 5-  g[g*]c  case , the b[a]p rings crowd the g6 amino group , and in this case the crowding is relieved by the severe untwisting accompanied by the increased roll , which produces the flexible bend observed by gel electrophoresis .    investigations with the 5-  i[g*]c  sequence context substantiated the critical role of the guanine amino group since i  ( figure 1(b ) ) lacks this group :   the gel electrophoretic manifestation of a flexible bend was abolished . the nmr data showed conformational heterogeneity in minor groove conformations , and the md simulations showed episodic denaturation of one of the two hydrogen bonds at the i : c base pair , explaining the heterogeneity . the repair efficiency relative to 5-  c[g*]c - i  , the standard sequence utilized in many nmr and ner studies [ 53 , 58 ] , is 4.1  0.2 , 1.7  0.2 and 1.3  0.2 for the 5-  c[g*]g  , 5-  g[g*]c  and 5-  i[g*]c  duplexes , respectively ( figure 4 ) . duplex , dynamic episodic denaturation of watson  crick base pairing flanking the lesion on the 5-side   correlates with the greatest ner susceptibility while the flexible bend in 5-  g[g*]c  is a less pronounced ner recognition signal , and the disturbance to one hydrogen bond in the 5-  i[g*]c  case provides a still lesser signal [ 52 , 53 ] in this series . the 5-  c[g * ] c - i  and 5-  t[g * ] t - ii  sequence contexts . the 5-  c[g*]c - ii  and 5-  t[g*]t - ii while a single , well - defined minor groove adduct conformation is observed in 5-  c[g*]c  duplexes , in the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  sequence context , the minor groove - aligned adduct conformation is heterogeneous .   furthermore , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis studies showed that the adduct induces a rigid bend in the 5-c[g*]c - ii sequence context , the lesion induces a highly flexible bend [ 59 , 60 ] . also , the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  11-mer duplex has a lower thermal melting point than the 11-mer 5- duplex   ( the exact difference depends on sequence length )    as expected from the thermodynamic properties of t  :  a and c  :  g watson - crick base pairs   [ 62 , 63 ] . molecular insights on these experimental observations   were provided by md simulations for the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  and 5-  c[g*]c - ii  duplexes . consistent with the conformational heterogeneity observed in the nmr studies   , it was found that the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  duplex is much more dynamic than the 5-  c[g*]c - ii  duplex : the highly dynamic base pair on the 5-side of the lesion exhibits episodic denaturation of one of the two watson - crick hydrogen bonds , in agreement with the partial rupturing of this base pair observed by the nmr methods ; also , the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  duplex shows somewhat increased and more dynamic roll and untwisting compared to the 5-  c[g*]c - ii duplex , consistent with the flexible bend observed only for the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  case ; in addition , the b[a]p ring system exhibits greater mobility and the duplex groove dimensions are more variable . the differences are accounted for by a coupled series of properties : the intrinsically weaker stacking of t - g compared to c - g steps allows for greater flexibility in the 5-  t[g*]t - ii duplex ;   the weaker t  :  a pair , with only two hydrogen bonds , compared to the c  :  g pair , with three bonds , provides enhanced flexibility ; moreover , the absence of guanine amino groups adjacent to the [ g * ] in the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  case allows for greater mobility for the b[a]p ring system . overall , the greater flexibility of the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  sequence is attributable to the absence of the guanine amino group .   the rates of incision in the human hela cell assay relative to 5-  c[g*]c - i is   2.4  0.2 and 1.6  0.2 for   the 5-  t[g*]t - ii  and the 5-  c[g*]c - ii  duplexes , respectively , corresponding to a 1.5  0.2-fold higher - repair efficiency for the 5-  t[g*]t - ii case is consistent with the overall enhanced dynamics manifested in various structural properties , notably watson - crick hydrogen bonding and bending . the  5-  c[g*]c - i   and  5-  c[g*]c - ii sequences ( figure 1(b ) ) differ in the   sequences   beyond the nearest neighbors to [ g * ] . since different sequence steps are known to be differentially flexible [ 57 , 65 ] , we hypothesized that the same minor groove lesion [ 50 , 64 ] with different distant neighbors would be differentially repaired . polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and self - ligation circularization experiments revealed that the 5-  c[g*]c - ii duplex is more bent and suggested that it has more torsional flexibility than the 5-  c[g*]c - i  duplex . the key role is played by the unique -c3-a4-c5- segment in the 5-  c[g*]c - ii  duplex . duplex originates from the guanine amino group at the c3  :  g20 pair ( figure 5 ) . this amino group acts as a wedge to open the minor groove ; facilitated by the highly deformable local -c3-a4- base step , the amino group allows the b[a]p ring system to better bury its hydrophobic surface within the groove walls . this produces a yet more enlarged minor groove which is coupled with more local untwisting and more enlarged and flexible roll ,   causing the greater bend   in 5-  c[g*]c - ii    ( figure 5 ) . the ner efficiencies are 1.6  0.2 times greater in the 5-  c[g*]c - ii  than in the 5-  c[g*]c - i  sequence context   showing that distant neighbors to [ g * ] modulate the ner susceptibility .   the greater ner susceptibility for the 5-  c[g*]c - ii duplex is explained by its greater bending with enhanced flexibility : the intrinsic minor groove enlargement caused by both the guanine amino groups [ 55 , 68 ] and the great flexibility of pyrimidine - purine steps , including the c - a step [ 57 , 6972 ]   allow the b[a]p moiety ( figure 5 )   to more favorably position itself , but at the expense of the greater bend that makes it more repair - susceptible . we have carried out a series of studies with the same 10s ( + ) -trans - anti - b[a]p - n - dg lesion in a number of sequence contexts that differ in how the lesion is positioned in relation to nearby guanine amino groups . additionally , we have considered differences in intrinsic flexibility of sequences flanking the lesion .   these are model systems for gaining understanding of ner lesion recognition factors . we have obtained molecular structural data by nmr and md simulations , bending properties from gel electrophoresis studies , and ner data from human hela cell extracts for all of our investigated sequence contexts ( figure 1(b ) ) . figure 4 summarizes our key findings and enables us to infer a hierarchy of ner recognition signals for the series of sequences and the single lesion we explored . we point out here that a variety of structural disturbances are found in each case , which are correlated . examples include impaired watson - crick pairing that is accompanied by diminished base stacking , and dna bending towards the major groove , that is induced by a minor groove lesion and is accompanied by minor groove enlargement . our present model system suggests that disturbed watson - crick base pairing is a better recognition signal than a flexible bend , and that these can act in concert to provide an enhanced signal : for example , for 5-  t[g*]t - ii  one episodically ruptured watson - crick hydrogen bond combined with the flexible bend results in better repair than   just one disturbed hydrogen bond as in 5-  i[g*]c  , or the flexible bend alone in 5-  g[g*]c    ( figure 4 ) .   for our system , steric hindrance between the minor groove - aligned lesion and nearby guanine amino groups , if present , determines the exact nature of the disturbances , depending on exactly where the guanine amino groups are situated . the intrinsic flexibility of the specific base steps also plays an important role in causing the differential disturbances . both the nearest neighbor and the more distant neighbor sequence contexts have an impact .   more globally , different lesions may cause different types of distortions depending on the specific nature of the lesion and its sequence context . however , regardless of exactly what these distortions are , we hypothesize that they must provide a local thermodynamic destabilization signal for repair to ensue , and the greater the extent of destabilization , the better the repair .   the destabilization would facilitate the strand separation , base - flipping , and -hairpin insertion by the xpc / hr23b recognition factor [ 41 , 73 ] needed to initiate ner .   in this way , the ner machinery would excise a large variety of lesions with different efficiencies , by recognizing the thermodynamic impact of the lesions rather than the lesions themselves [ 24 , 29 , 41 , 73 ] .    lesions that resist ner present a great hazard , as they survive to the replication step and produce a mutagenic outcome ; such ner - resistant lesions provide an important opportunity for gaining further understanding of the mechanism utilized by the ner apparatus to recognize different lesions .","nucleotide excision repair ( ner ) plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the genome when damaged by bulky dna lesions , since inefficient repair can cause mutations and human diseases notably cancer . 
 the structural properties of dna lesions that determine their relative susceptibilities to ner are therefore of great interest .   as a model system 
 , we have investigated the major mutagenic lesion derived from the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene ( b[a]p ) , 
                   10s ( + ) -trans - anti - b[a]p - n2-dg in six different sequence contexts that differ in how the lesion is positioned in relation to nearby guanine amino groups . 
 we have obtained molecular structural data by nmr and md simulations , bending properties from gel electrophoresis studies , and ner data obtained from human hela cell extracts for our six investigated sequence contexts . 
 this model system suggests that disturbed watson - crick base pairing is a better recognition signal than a flexible bend , and that these can act in concert to provide an enhanced signal . 
 steric hinderance between the minor groove - aligned lesion and nearby guanine amino groups determines the exact nature of the disturbances .   both nearest neighbor and more distant neighbor sequence contexts have an impact . 
 regardless of the exact distortions , we hypothesize that they provide a local thermodynamic destabilization signal for repair .",278
"anatomists have observed that the length of the esophagus , i.e. the distance from the incisors to the esophagogastric junction , varies in different individuals from 32 to 50 cm . by endoscopy , the usual length of on adult essphagus is measured as 40 cm from the incisor to the point where mucosal change occurs , but the esophageal length varies from one person to another according to physical status . this variability is often experienced when trying to insert a ph meter , manometer or even nasogastric tube , or when placing the prosthesis for benign or malignant stenosis . we measured various lengths of esophagi in korean adults using a flexible fibercope and measured the external body intervals . then , we analyzed these data and extrapolated the various esophageal lengths with measurable external body intervals to obtain the correlations . the study was conducted for the measurement of esophageal length in 196 persons , 97 males and 99 females , with normal esophagogastric endoscopic findings . the distances from the upper incisors to 5 anatomical levels of esophagus ( cricopharyngeus narrowing , aortic narrowing , left main bronchus narrowing , hiatus and gastroesophageal junction ) were measured by an endoscope with 1 cm markings ( olympus co. q20 foreward view ) ( fig . 1 ) . each length was the mean value of double measurements during full inspiration and expiration respectively . the external body interval lengths studied were standing height , sitting height , the distance from the 7th vertebra to the coccyx and the distance from the upper incisors to the external occipital protuberance . the standing height and sitting height the distance from the 7th cervical vertebra to the coccyx was measured with a tape measure . a specially designed measure was used for the distance from the incisors to the external occipital protuberance ( fig . data analysis and correlation of esophageal lengths to external body intervals were done using spss / pc ( statistical package for social science / pc ) . observations have shown great variation in the length of the esophagus in adults but good correlation between esophageal lengths and external parameters . the measured lengths of external body intervals and various anatomical esophageal levels are depicted in table 1 . the mean standing - height and sitting - height of 196 persons studied were 160.808.64 cm and 86.605.91 cm , respectively . the interval from the upper incisors to each anatomical landmark of the esophagus ( cricopharyngeal narrowing , aortic arch compression , left main bronchus compression , hiatus , and esophagogastric junction ) were 15.70 cm , respectively . the true esophageal length , which is the distance from the cricopharyngeal narrowing to the esophagogastric junction , was 24.932.76 cm . the correlation of each esophageal anatomical level with external body intervals using the multiple stepwise reggression method is shown in table 2 . each of these 4 external variables was statistically significant , but better correlations were demonstrated by the h1 and h3 . although we employed the measurable distance ( h4 ) instead of the unmeasurable distance ( l1 ) , the equations using h4 and h2 did not express the esophageal lengths more accurately than the equation using h1 and h3 only . for example , the distance from the incisors to the esophagogastric junction ( l5 ) could be neatly expressed in simple equations as the following : 
 l5a=0.178  h1 + 0.176  h3 + 2.219  ( r2=0.58 ,  p<0.01)l5b=0.242  h1 + 2.076  ( r2=0.55 ,  p<0.01 )   likewise , all other esophageal lengths could be approximated with the equations using h1 and h3 or with the equation using h1 only . the development of improved capability in medical and surgical managment of esophageal disease processes has been significant . to understand and appropriately use current technologic advancements , the anatomic properties of the esophagus available information about esophageal length , however , has been based on cadaveric measurements , because it is not feasible to measure esophageal length in vivo . in adults , the distances from the incisor teeth to the esophagogastric junction have been described to be in the range of 3250 cm by various studies , and the described distance from the cricopharyngeus narrowing to the esophagogastric junction usually varies from 20 to 30 cm . on the other hand , jackson described esophageal lengths according to various age groups . but such wide ranges of esophageal values and different physical status even in the same age group hamper the application of these data to individual patients in esophageal procedures . the best approximation of esophageal length would be useful for various clinical procedures , such as placement of a ph meter , manometer and nasogastric tubes , insertion of an endoprosthesis and colonic interpostition for both benign and malignant stenotic segments . we conducted this study to determine the mean esophageal length of various anatomical levels and to derive a method approximating true esophageal lengths . the mean esophageal lengths from the upper incisors to the esophagogastric junction were 42.612.42 cm in men and 39.472.24 cm in women . these values are not smaller than western data despite the fact that koreans are shorter . this is possible because previous data were based on cadaveric examination and koreans have a different racial stature . we correlated several external body intervals with esophageal lengths by the multiple stepwise regression method : standing height , sitting height , the distance from the 7th cervical vertebra to the coccyx and the distance from the upper incisors to the occiput . all external parameters significantly correlated with the true esophageal lengths . based on our results , the distance from the upper incisors to the esophagogastric junction ( l5 ) can be best approximated by employing following equations : 
 l5=0.178  h1 + 0.176  h3 + 2.219  ( r2=0.58 ,  p<0.001)l5=0.242  h1 + 2.078  ( r2=0.55 ,  p<0.01 ) but accuracy determined by the other equations using more variables other than height did not increase remarkably despite their complexities . likewise , other anatomical levels of the esophagus can be predicted accurately as shown in the previous results . in conclusion , we consider that an accurate appraisal of the true length of an adult esophagus can be made by measuring the height and the other external measurable parameters .","previous data for esophageal lengths are based on age related groups or cadaveric examination , both of which are improper for application to various individualized procedures . because of the variability in height for any given age and longer length in vivo , lindividualized approximation is needed . 
 thus , we measured various anatomical levels of the esophagus using a flexible endoscope and correlated these data with measurable external body intervals.the mean esophageal length was 40.922.79 , which is longer than the length derived from cadaveric examinations . also , esophageal lengths which correlated better with height than any other body intervals , could be calculated from the following equation . esophageal length from the upper incisors to the esophagogastric junction ( l ) 
 can be expressed : l = 0.242  height ( ht ) + 2.078 cm ( p = 0.000 , r2 = 0525).the data from our study indicate that esophageal length can be reliably predicted using external body parameters before employing various procedures .",208
"a key issue in biomedicine and biotechnology is to control processes in cells with the highest specificity without unwanted side effects of the intervening agents . gene transcription is universally controlled by structural elements within the gene , cisacting regulatory elements , which specifically bind transcription factors.1 among these cisacting elements , the core promoters bind general transcription factors of the general transcription machinery , whereas enhancer elements and proximal promoter elements bind sequencespecific transcription factors , which activate transcription by stimulating transcription initiation at the core promoter . targeting these enhancer and proximal promoter elements with , for example , synthetic sequencespecific transcription factors , represents a way to activate the transcription of only the genes harboring these elements . yet however , unlike enhancer elements , which act independently of their distance to the core promoter , the effect of proximal promoter elements depends on the distance between the transcription factor binding site and the core promoter.2 , 3 transcription factors are modular proteins composed of a dna binding domain ( dbd ) , which specifically recognizes the response element , and a transactivation domain ( tad ) , which directly or indirectly interacts with the general transcription machinery at the core promoter . therefore , if one could engineer an artificial transcription factor with a fixed distance between the dbd and the tad that matches the distance between the proximal promoter element and the core promoter of a particular gene ( figure  1 ) , one would potentially have a much more specific tool to selectively activate the transcription of this gene . a )  a dnabinding domain ( dbd ) and transactivation domain ( tad ) are separated by a rigid don of a length matching the distance between the transcription factor binding site ( tfbs ) and the core promoter of gene  a. upon binding of the dbd moiety to the tfbs , the tad would be ideally positioned to activate the transcription of gene  a. the length of the don does not match the distance between the tfbs and core promoter in gene  b. therefore , gene  b is predicted not to be activated by the construct . b )  as a test case , a rigid , tubular don ( don1 ) derivatized with the suicide ligands benzylguanine ( bg ) at one end and chlorohexane ( ch ) at the other end is functionalized with a bgreactive , snaptagged version of the dbd of the yeast gal4 transcription factor and with a chreactive , halotagged version of the vp16 tad to generate don  gv . don gv is then microinjected in zebrafish embryos together with a luciferase reporter gene construct , in which five copies of the consensus binding site for gal4 ( 5uas ) are separated from the core promoter by a spacer sequence predicted to match the length of the don . they are readily available by folding a long singlestranded dna ( ssdna ) molecule with a designed set of short synthetic  staplestrand oligonucleotides.5 , 6 , 7 dna origami nanostructures ( dons ) have typical dimensions in the 10100  nm regime , which perfectly match those of large supramolecular protein complexes , such as the molecular machinery involved in gene regulation , cell signaling , or cell division.8 more importantly , these dimensions are within the range of the typical distances between proximal promoter elements and core promoters . furthermore , dons have unique structuredirecting properties , because they can be used as scaffolds for the precise arrangement of nonnucleic acid components such as proteins or colloidal nanoparticles.9 , 10 it is , therefore , not surprising that there is increasing activity to explore dons as tools to manipulate and analyze cellular functions.11 along this line , efforts are underway to study the stability and function of dons under in  vitro and in  vivo conditions . for instance , it has been demonstrated that dons are stable reagents under cell culturing conditions.12 , 13 , 14 dons are functional as immuneactivating programmable adjuvants,15 , 16 and they can be used as drugdelivery vehicles to circumvent drug resistance.17 , 18 , 19 , 20 these studies have suggested that intracellular don uptake is usually dependent on endocytosis.18 furthermore , dons can bind to the outside of the cells to stimulate cellular transmembrane receptors.21 , 22 , 23 
  despite these exciting reports , the exploitation of dons for the analysis and manipulation of cells is still in its infancy , and there is a strong demand for further insights into the complex interactions of these synthetic biomacromolecules with the machinery of living systems . towards this goal , we report here the microinjection of a proteinfunctionalized don construct into zebrafish embryos ( figure  1 ) . our working hypothesis is that using a don to control the distance between a dbd and a tad in order to match the distance between a proximal promoter element and a core promoter would enable the selective activation of a downstream gene . as a test system , we took advantage of the gal4uas system . this binary expression system has been widely used in many model species to drive the expression of genes . the first component of the binary system consists of a synthetic transcription factor composed of the dbd of the yeast gal4 transcription factor fused to the tad of the herpes simplex vp16 protein . the second component is comprised of a synthetic gene with a tandem array of the dna binding sites for the galvp16 chimera , called the upstream activating sequence or uas ( cgg agtac t gtcct ccg),24 upstream of a minimal core promoter . this uas promoter controls the expression of downstream cloned genes with dependence on the gal4vp16 chimeric transcription factor.25 it is known that gal4vp16 fusion proteins generate robust expression from the uas responder genes in transient and stable activation assays in zebrafish.26 to allow for a quantitative assessment of transcription , we chose the firefly luciferase reporter gene as a regulated gene . to test the effect of the distance between the uas and the core promoter in the reporter plasmid , they were separated from each other by a variable spacer ( grey region of the reporter gene , figure  1 ) . the reporter plasmid was constructed by gibson cloning27 by sequentially aligning five copies of the uas , a spacer , a minimal cmv ( cytomegalie virus ) promoter and the firefly reporter gene28 ( detailed plasmid map shown in figure  s1 ) . we reasoned that , upon injection into zebrafish embryo , the level of expression of the firefly luciferase reporter should then depend on the distance between the dbd ( gal4 ) and the tad ( vp16 ) physically connected to each other through a don spacer in the supramolecular construct don to prepare the don  gv construct , we assembled a threedimensional 811148  nm rigidrod tubular don1 ( figure  2  a ) by using the singlestranded 5438  nt template 109z5 , prepared as previously described.29

m :  page ruler prestained protein ladder . the appearance of a second band with lower electrophoretic mobility upon incubation with the ligandconjugated dna oligonucleotides ( sample  2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) indicates the successful conjugation of the protein with the respective staples . b )  halovp16 and gal4snap do not bind to don2 , a construct lacking ch and bgmodified staple strands ( lanes  15 ) . in contrast , don1 containing the ch and bg modifications can bind both of the proteins , as indicated from the shift of the bands in lanes  79 . note that the conjugation with halovp16 ( lane  8) induces only slight electrophoretic mobility shifts , presumably owing to net negative charge of vp16 ( pi=4.4 ) . this is a 0.75  % agarose gel , 70  v , 3  h , visualized by cy5 fluorescence imaging  ( top ) and ethidium bromide staining  ( bottom ) . we then started to analyze the behavior of the dons in  vivo in the zebrafish embryo . to this end , we used a zebrafish line stably expressing gfpfused histone h2a33 that labels the cells nuclei and , thereby , facilitates the determination of the dons subcellular localization . don1 ( approximately 500  pl , 250  nm ) was injected into the yolk of onecellstage embryos and the embryos were imaged 6  h later ( figure  4  a ) . onecell stage embryos from a zebrafish line stably expressing gfpfused histone h2a were used,33 which allows the direct localization of the cell nuclei  ( green channel ) . the cy5labeled constructs  ( red channel ) were microinjected into the yolk with don1 alone  ( a ) , the proteindecorated don ( don1gv ; b ) or don1gv along with the reporter plasmid  ( c ) . then , at 6  h postfertilization , the embryos were embedded in agarose and analyzed by using confocal fluorescence microscopy . three channels were recorded : the brightfield image  ( i ) , the signal from the gfphistone h2 in green  ( ii ) , and the cy5 signal from the dons in red  ( iii ) . the highintensity signal in the red channel shows that the large dna constructs were internalized at a high rate from the yolk . in addition , the high magnification  ( bottom images ) clearly indicates that the internalized dons are mostly cytosolic  ( orange arrow ) , with very little to no nuclear localization  ( white arrow ) . note that the presence of neither the proteins nor the reporter plasmid influenced the internalization or the subcellular distribution of the dons . scale bars :  30  m and 10  m for low and high magnification , respectively . the injected embryos survived and developed normally , suggesting that the introduced nanomaterial was well tolerated . this result shows that don1 has no obvious deleterious effects on early embryonic development and is indeed efficiently internalized from the yolk ( figure  4  a , panel  iii ) . however , comparison of the nuclei position ( gfp signal , panel  ii ) with the don fluorescent signal ( panel  iii ) indicates that the don localizes mainly to the cytosol . gv injected alone or together with the reporter plasmid ( figures  4  b and 4  c , respectively ) . the don  gv also had no obvious effect on early embryonic development and was internalized by the cells . furthermore , it was only detected in the cytosol , irrespective of the presence of the reporter plasmid ( figures  4  b and 4  c ) . gv had no effect on the expression of the reporter gene , as compared to the don1 ( data not shown ) . spherical particles with a diameter below 26  nm freely diffuse into the nucleus , whereas larger particles require a nuclear localization signal ( nls ) to actively translocate through the nuclear pore complex , with an upper size limit of about 39  nm.34 the gal4dbd used to functionalize the don  gv harbors an intrinsic nuclear localization signal.35 however , it was apparently not sufficient to drive the don  gv to the nucleus . recently , it was shown that functionalization with an nls increases the nuclear uptake of 510  nm100300  nm rodshaped polymeric gv is unlikely because of its size , but rather to a low efficiency of the gal4dbd nls in the context of the construct . stronger  nls as a peptide covalently attached to the don might increase its nuclear uptake . we report here on an ambitious concept for controlling gene transcription in a distancedependent manner in the developing zebrafish embryo , taking advantage of designed protein  dna origami nanostructures . although we could clearly demonstrate the successful synthesis of our target construct , applications in  vivo require further developments . nonetheless , we believe that our study represents an important contribution to the exploitation of dons for the analysis and manipulation of cells in  vivo . we demonstrated , for the first time , that microinjection in the yolk of the zebrafish embryo enables intracellular distribution in most of the cells of large origami constructs harboring active proteins precisely arranged in a 3d fashion . furthermore , we demonstrated that the don constructs are not toxic for the embryos and allowed normal development , at least in the early stages . we foresee that this technology could be applied to deliver complex multiprotein constructs to the cytosol and maybe also to the nuclei by means of strong nuclear localization signals . as a service to our authors and readers , this journal provides supporting information supplied by the authors . such materials are peer reviewed and may be reorganized for online delivery , but are not copyedited or typeset . technical support issues arising from supporting information ( other than missing files ) should be addressed to the authors .","abstractthe unique structuredirecting properties of dna origami nanostructures ( dons ) show great potential to specifically manipulate intracellular processes . 
 we report an innovative concept to selectively activate the transcription of a single gene in the developing zebrafish embryo . 
 we reason that engineering a designer transcription factor in which a rigid don imposes a fixed distance between the dnabinding domain ( dbd ) and the transactivation domain ( tad ) would allow the selective activation of a gene harboring the same distance between the corresponding transcription factor binding site and the core promoter . as a test case , a rigid tubular don was designed to separate the dbd of the gal4 transcription factor and the vp16 viral protein as a tad . 
 this construct was microinjected in the yolk of onecellstage zebrafish embryos , together with a reporter plasmid to assess its functionality . 
 the large don was efficiently distributed to cells of the developing embryo and showed no signs of toxicity . however , because the don showed only a cytosolic localization , it did not activate transcription of the reporter gene . 
 although this work clearly demonstrates that don microinjection enables the intracellular distribution of multiprotein architectures in most of the cells of the developing zebrafish embryo , further refinements are necessary to enable selective gene activation in  vivo .",265
"sd , a 45-year - old caucasian male , was referred for evaluation for liver 
 transplantation because 
 of end - stage liver disease caused by hepatitis b. he had 
 been well until six months prior to his initial visit , when he started losing 
 weight and developed severe fatigue . during the six - month period , he had lost 
 25 kilograms . his past 
 medical history was significant for non - hodgkin 's lymphoma that was diagnosed 
 eleven years ago . he was treated with 8 cycles of chop chemotherapy and had 
 been in remission since then . on examination , the patient appeared mildly icteric . the abdomen was 
 soft with some tenderness in the right upper quadrant and ascites . complete 
 blood count showed a leukocyte count of 2500 cells / mm , hemoglobin 
 of 9.8 gm / dl , and platelet count of 29 000 cells / mm . his liver 
 function tests were abnormal with a total bilirubin of 5 mg / dl ( normal , 0.21.2 mg / dl ) , alt : 
 361 u / l ( normal , 1763 u / l ) , ast : 750 iu / l ( normal , 1540 u / l ) , total 
 protein : 15.4 g / dl ( normal , 6.17.9 g / dl ) , albumin : 2.9 g / dl ( normal , 3.94.8 g / dl ) , and an 
 inr of 1.9 . serological tests for viral hepatitis were as follows : hepatitis b 
 surface antigen positive ( hbsag ) , hepatitis b surface antibody negative 
 ( antihbs ) , hbe antigen negative , hbe antibody positive , igm antibody to 
 hepatitis b core antigen positive , igg antibody to hepatitis b core antigen 
 positive , and hbv dna 4 150 000 iu / ml ( by pcr ) . ct 
 scan and ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed a small liver with 
 moderate ascites , splenomegaly , patent portal , and hepatic veins . the striking elevation in his globulin fraction ( 12.5 g / dl ) 
 was further worked up . serum protein electrophoresis showed the presence of a 
 large monoclonal protein spike ( m protein ) in the gamma region which on 
 immunofixation electrophoresis ( ife ) was identified to be iga - kappa type ( see figure 1 ) . the iga levels were increased at 6730 mg / dl ( reference range 70400 mg / dl ) and 
 the igg and igm levels were decreased at 466 mg / dl ( reference range 7001600 mg / dl ) and 
 25.6 mg / dl ( reference range 40320 mg / dl ) , 
 respectively . a bone 
 marrow biopsy on two separate occasions showed normocellular bone marrow with 
 less than 2 percent population of plasma cells . full body positron emission tomography ( pet ) scan and ct scan were 
 performed , and no focus suspicious for lymphoma or myeloma or infection was 
 identified . whole body mri was unremarkable . on retrospective review , the 
 patient had an elevated total protein ( 12 g / dl ) approximately six months prior 
 to initial visit . within the 
 next few weeks , the patient continued to deteriorate , and he developed 
 worsening ascites with hyponatremia . it was clear that the patient had 
 progressive liver disease from chronic hepatitis b with a relatively high meld 
 score of 23 , and he would benefit from a liver transplantation . our dilemma 
 before proceeding with liver transplantation was whether he had an underlying 
 hematological malignancy that was causing the monoclonal gammopathy . we were also concerned 
 about potential vascular complications after liver transplant given his 
 increased viscosity . however , due to his deterioration and absence of any 
 clear - cut evidence of malignancy , it was decided to place the patient on the 
 liver transplant wait list . anti - hbv 
 therapy was initiated with a combination of entecavir ( 0.5 mg / day ) and 
 tenofovir ( 300 mg / day ) to decrease his hbv dna to the lowest possible level 
 before transplantation . however , he was on this antiviral therapy for less than 
 a month as he received a deceased donor liver transplant ten days after 
 listing . in the period between listing and liver transplantation , his bilirubin 
 continued to trend up from 3.3 mg / dl to 4.6 mg / dl , and his total protein level 
 fluctuated between 12.5 g / dl and 13.5 g / dl . , he received two doses of rabbit antithymocyte globulin at 1.5 mg / kg during the time of transplant and on postoperative day 2 . subsequently , the 
 mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn , and he is currently on tacrolimus 
 monotherapy with trough levels between 35 mg / ml . he 
 continues to receive hepatitis b immunoglobulin infusion every month along with 
 entecavir ( 0.5 mg / day ) , and his hepatitis b antibody titre has been kept above 
 300 miu / ml . he is currently 9 months posttransplant , his total protein levels 
 range 4 - 5 g / dl , and he has had no detectable m protein spike . the temporal relation 
 of the liver transplant with disappearance of hepatitis b surface antigen and 
 normalization of the monoclonal spike implicates hepatitis b as the 
 possible cause of the m protein spike . there is very little data and uncertainty regarding the incidence and natural history of 
 m proteins in a person with hepatitis b. it has been suggested that the immunological response elicited against hepatitis 
 b virus in the host rather than the direct cytopathic effect of the virus may 
 be the basis for the pathogenesis of hepatic and nonhepatic manifestations . hepatitis b 
 virus seems particularly well suited to initiate a chronic immune disease 
 because of its tendency to persist in spite of a good immune response . this may cause clonal expansion of the 
 immunoglobulin secreting cells and may explain the above phenomenon . 
 alternately , the m protein spike could represent increased serum 
 immunoconglutinin titres . it has been previously suggested that elevated serum 
 immunoconglutinin titers in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis b virus 
 infection may represent a physiological autoimmune response to hbsag / anti - hbs 
 immune complexes . although our patient did not have the anti - hbs antibody , 
 it has been suggested that in the light of massive antigenemia present in 
 chronic hbsag carriers , it is possible that anti - hbs exists in the form of 
 hbsag / anti - hbs immune complexes . this would make it difficult to detect 
 anti - hbs in serum samples by conventional serological methods . the primary issue was whether 
 he was eligible for liver transplantation in the presence of an increasing m 
 protein . the fact that he had lymphoma 10 years ago complicated this 
 evaluation . additionally , an association between hepatitis b infection 
 and non - hodgkin 's lymphoma has been previously described . however , he had had regular follow - ups every six months 
 after remission of lymphoma , and also his malignancy workup prior to transplant 
 was negative . moreover , the m protein spike was noticed only 6 months prior to 
 transplant and this coincided with the elevation of his liver function tests . 
 surprisingly , his igm antibody to hepatitis b core antigen was positive , as was 
 his total core antibody . he did have active hepatitis and this can be deduced 
 by the fact that he had an alt level that was 10 times the upper limits of 
 normal ; his explanted liver showed significant inflammatory activity . it was felt 
 that most likely he had a flare of his chronic hbv , which might have triggered 
 the elevation in m protein . because 
 of his elevated m protein and an urgent need for liver transplantation , we 
 decided to initiate dual therapy with a nucleoside ( entecavir ) and nucleotide 
 ( tenofovir ) analogue to decrease his hbv dna . however , he was on therapy less than a month before a suitable organ 
 became available . we decided to accept the organ because of high meld score 
 rather than to wait for hbv dna disappearance . since we were planning to 
 continue therapy posttransplant along with hbig ( target anti - hbs titers > 500 iu / ml first three months and levels of > 300 iu / ml after three months ) , 
 we believed that the risk of recurrence of hbv was very small . unfortunately in 
 the time period before the transplant and after initiation of antiviral therapy , 
 we failed to follow his iga levels and hbv dna levels . however , his protein levels remained 
 unchanged suggesting that there may have been very little change in his 
 gammopathy , and this is not surprising given the fact that nucleos(t)ide 
 therapy seldom leads to hbsag clearance in that time frame . after 
 liver transplantation and with clearance of the hepatitis b surface antigen , 
 the m protein levels became normal . one and the most likely reason is the 
 removal of antigen source with native hepatectomy . his hepatitis b surface 
 antigen , m protein , and total protein levels remain within normal limits 1 year 
 after transplantation . the second possibility is the impact of thymocyte , given 
 at the time of transplant , on plasma cells . antithymocyte globulin has been 
 used in treatment of plasma cell dyscrasias   due to its activity against 
 several plasma cell antigens . this is less likely in our patient because 
 thymocyte globulin was used only as induction therapy at the time of 
 transplantation . the elimination half time of thymoglobulin is 2 - 3 days and is 
 unlikely that its effect on plasma cell is sustained for a year . in 
 conclusion , this case demonstrates that monoclonal gammopathy can be associated 
 with chronic hepatitis b infection and can be eliminated after successful 
 transplantation .","monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( mgus ) has been most commonly associated with diseases like multiple myeloma , waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia , primary systemic amyloidosis , hiv , and other lymphoproliferative disorders . 
 there has been an isolated report of mgus in patients coinfected with hiv and hepatitis b , as the work by amara et al . in 2006 .   here

 designation of crossovers involves selective localization of sumo - ligase rnf212 to a minority of recombination sites where it stabilizes pertinent factors , such as muts4 . here 
 we show ubiquitin - ligase hei10/ccnb1ip15,6 is essential for this crossover / non - crossover differentiation process . in hei10 mutant mice , 
 rnf212 localizes to most recombination sites and dissociation of rnf212 and muts from chromosomes is blocked . 
 consequently , recombination is impeded and crossing - over fails . in wild - type mice , hei10 accumulates at designated crossover sites suggesting a late role to implement crossing - over . like rnf212 
 , dosage - sensitivity indicates hei10 is a limiting factor for crossing - over . 
 we suggest sumo and ubiquitin play antagonistic roles during meiotic recombination that are balanced to effect differential stabilization of recombination factors at crossover and non - crossover sites .",244
"cystic fibrosis ( cf ) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder among caucasians with an incidence rate of 1 in 2,500 individuals . the epithelial cells of several organs , including respiratory tract , exocrine pancreas , intestine , vas deferens , hepatobiliary system and also exocrine sweat glands are involved in cf . therefore several clinical features , including suppurative lung disease , pancreatic insufficiency , neonatal bowel obstruction ( meconium ileus ) , multifocal biliary cirrhosis , absent vas deferens to malabsorbtive condition and growth retardation could be seen in affected patients [ 2 , 3 ] . high sweat electrolytes ( chloride and sodium ) concentration , which is seen in cf patients became basis for sweat chloride test since 1949 . the measurement of sweat electrolyte concentrations was established as a standard procedure for diagnosis of cf and remained the gold standard test for the diagnosis of cf . the diagnosis of cf could easily be made in the majority of cases based on typical clinical features and abnormal sweat chloride values . in such situations , genetic analysis of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( cftr ) gene is not necessary . however , it may be useful in confirming the diagnosis , which also enables carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis [ 6 , 7 ] . the universally accepted reference intervals for sweat chloride concentrations regardless of age or sex are > 60 mmol / l , which is considered diagnostic of cf ; 4060 mmol / l is considered borderline , whilst < 40 in addition to sweat chloride concentrations , sweat sodium is also usually measured , as there is little difference between sweat sodium and chloride concentrations [ 810 ] in order to ensure accurate results from a quantitative sweat test using filter paper , a minimum sweat rate of 1g / m / min corresponding to 75 mg collected in 30 minutes is required ( for a 22 inch filter paper ) . conventionally , it takes around 45 minutes to collect proper volume ( 50400 mg ) sweat for accurate test , which makes the classic sweat test as a time consuming procedure . indeed many local laboratories in developing countries have not been approved to do the test for both techniques of sweat gathering and also electrolytes measuring . forming of salt crystallization of perspiration described by ferre calvete et al   could be considered as a useful and alternative test for easy detecting cf patients in these regions . therefore , we designed this study to compare the results obtained by these two methods . in this study , 60 children with clinical signs suggestive of cf , who were referred to the children 's medical center , pediatrics center of excellence in iran , were investigated . the study protocol was approved by the research ethics board of the childrens medical center , tehran university of medical sciences . classic sweat tests ( gibson and cooke sweat test ) and crystallization test were performed for each subject for at least two times in the referral laboratory of the hospital . localized sweating was produced by iontophoresis of pilocarpine nitrate ( gibson and cook method ) using wescor gel discs [ 5 , 12 ] a copper electrode was then attached and a weak electrical current of about 3 milli -

 this study was performed to compare sweat chloride values obtained by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis ( classic test ) with sweat crystallization detected by direct observation of a drop of perspiration under light microscopy in patients with and without cf.methodsthe tests using both techniques were performed simultaneously in patients with and without cf . 
 cutoff values of 60 mmol / l of chloride concentration for the classic sweat test was considered for diagnosis of cf . in crystallization method , 
 observation of typical dendritic forms of salt crystals under light microscopy was interpreted positive.findingssixty patients suspected to cf ( 31 males and 29 females ) with age range of 9 months to 2 years underwent the sweat test using both techniques . 
 median sweat chloride values was 26.13 + 10.85 in group with negative and 72.76 + 12.78 
 mmol / l in group with positive sweat test , respectively . 
 all the patients who had positive sweat test in classic method showed typical dendritic forms of salt crystal in sweat crystallization test , which provided the test with 100% sensitivity ( 95%ci : 93.1100 ) . 
 only one of the 31 subjects with negative results for classic sweat test had positive result for crystallization sweat test , which provided the test with 96.7% specificity ( 95%ci : 92.9100 ) . 
 time spent to perform the crystallization test was significantly shorter than the classic method whereas its cost was also lower than the second method.conclusionthere was a good correspondence between two studied methods of sweat test . 
 these results suggested the sweat crystallization test as an alternative test for detecting cf disease with high sensitivity and specificity .",368
"stroke , with a high prevalence and long - term disabilities , is a major health problem in the 
 world1 , 2 , and it was reported that about two million people suffer from 
 stroke each year3 . impairments including 
 loss of strength , sensation , and coordination abilities , which result in walking 
 difficulties , balance disorders , and limb function disturbance , occur in 7080% of stroke 
 patients4 . this affects the life quality 
 of patients adversely and leads to a heavy economic burden on society . subsequently , 
 effective rehabilitation interventions to optimize recovery in stroke patients have received 
 high attention . in the treatment of balance and gait dysfunction , exercise therapy is regarded as one of 
 the commonly used methods that bring greater benefits in physical function for stroke 
 patients5 . the effect of exercises on 
 balance and gait dysfunction in stroke patients has been confirmed by many clinical 
 studies3 , 6 , 
 7 . in addition , core stability exercises 
 have been widely carried out in many fields , including medical rehabilitation , sports 
 training , and medical care . core stability exercises were shown to improve dynamic standing 
 balance , functional autonomy , static balance , flexibility , and stability8 . in recent years , core stability exercises have been reported to improve the rehabilitation 
 effect in stroke patients . in a study of 20 stroke patients , the control group underwent 
 standard exercise therapy , while the experiment group underwent both the core 
 stability - enhancing exercise and standard exercise therapy simultaneously . after 4 weeks , yu 
 found that the mean trunk impairment scale score and muscle activity of the lower trunk 
 increased in the experiment group significantly9 . in study by cabanas - valdes , 80 patients were randomly assigned to 
 an experimental group and a control group , both groups underwent conventional therapy 
 including exercises , and the experimental group performed core stability exercises . the 
 results showed that core stability exercises improve the efficacy of conventional 
 exercises10 . although these studies 
 confirmed the effect of core stability exercises in the rehabilitation of stroke patients , 
 few comparative studies have been carried out to compare the effect of core stability 
 exercises and conventional exercises . which is better in improving the stability and balance 
 of stroke patients , core stability or conventional exercises ? therefore , a prospective study including 40 participants was carried out in the department 
 of neurology of yidu central hospital of weifang between january 2014 and february 2015 . the 
 objective of the study was to determine which is better in the rehabilitation of stroke 
 patients , core stability exercises or conventional exercises . participants with stroke - induced hemiplegia were recruited from the department of neurology 
 of yidu central hospital of weifang between january 2014 and february 2015 . the diagnosis 
 and lesion side of these participants were confirmed by history evaluation , physical 
 examination , brain imaging , and examination of their medical records . the inclusion 
 criteria9 were ability to walk more than 
 32 feet , duration of disorder > 6 months , no musculoskeletal problems , absence of any 
 cardiac disorders , complete understanding of this research , and ability to communicate . the 
 included participants were randomly divided into either an experimental or control group by 
 a random computer - generated sequence . the randomization was managed by a physician who was 
 not involved in the study . all the included patients 
 signed an informed consent form , and the study was approved by the ethics committee of our 
 hospital . the patients in the control group performed conventional exercises including limb 
 stretching , passive mobilization of joints , walking between parallel bars , and occupational 
 therapy11 . the patients in the 
 experiment group performed core stability exercises including the plank , side plank , bridge , 
 straight leg raise , and modified push - up12 . before the beginning of the study , the patients were given 
 individual instruction by the researchers . during the exercises , physicians provide 
 necessary assistance to help the patients in executing the exercises . the exercises in both 
 groups were performed for one hour per day , six times a week for six weeks . the modified barthel index ( mbi)13 and 
 berg balance scale ( bbs)13 were used to 
 assess the clinical outcomes of the two groups . the mbi , which demonstrates the ability of 
 patients to deal with daily activities , consists of ten items including personal hygiene , 
 taking a bath alone , eating , using the bathroom , ascending stairs , dressing , defecating , 
 controlling urine , walking or using a wheelchair , and moving to a chair or bed . each item is 
 rated on a scale of 5 ranging from independent conduct to impossible to conduct . the bbs , 
 which can evaluate static and dynamic balance abilities of patients , consists of 14 items 
 covering functional tasks in three domains , sitting , standing , and changing posture , that 
 are scored on a scale of 04 . ibm spss statistics 21.0 ( ibm corp . , armonk , ny , usa ) was used for statistical analysis , 
 and p < 0.05 was considered significant . the differences in the baseline data including 
 age , gender , and disease course were compared using the t test or  test . in the current study , 40 patients with stroke - induced hemiplegia were included and divided 
 randomly into experimental and control groups , with 20 participants in each group at the 
 beginning of the study . the baseline clinical data including age , gender , disease course , 
 bbs , and mbi were recorded . there was no significant difference in baseline data between the 
 two groups ( p>0.05 ) . the patients in the control group performed conventional exercises 
 for six weeks and those in the experimental group carried out core stability exercises for 
 six weeks . three patients in the experimental group and two in the control group withdrew from the 
 study two weeks after treatment , and in total thirty - five patients completed the training . the final results showed that , compared with the baseline , the mean mbi scores of the 
 experimental and control groups increased significantly from 53.5 and 55.1 to 66.8 and 61.2 
 ( p<0.05 ) , respectively , and that the mean bbs scores increased significantly from 30.2 
 and 31.9 to 38.6 and 35.7 ( p<0.05 ) , respectively . in addition , mbi scores were 
 significantly lower ( p<0.05 ) in the control group than in the experimental group . the bbs 
 scores in the control group were relatively lower than those in the experimental group , but 
 there was no significant difference between the two groups ( p>0.05 ) . a prospective study was carried out to compare the effect of core stability exercises and 
 conventional exercises on patients with stroke - induced hemiplegia . to the best of our 
 knowledge the core , described as a box in the trunk with the 
 abdominals , paraspinals , and gluteals ; diaphragm and pelvic floor ; and hip girdle 
 musculature serving as the front wall , back wall , roof , and bottom , respectively , makes up 
 the largest part of the body and plays an important role in stabilizing the body and 
 controlling movement of daily activities9 . core stability is regarded as a prerequisite for maintaining proper posture of the lumbar 
 and pelvic regions during sports activities9 . as a result , core stability exercises have many advantages in the 
 field of rehabilitation and can improve the activation and cooperative contractions of 
 abdominal and multifidus muscles , facilitating the function and movement of the limbs9 , 12 . in the current study , the mbi and bbs scores after treatment were significantly increased 
 in both the experimental and control groups when compared with those before treatment . this 
 indicates that both core stability exercises and conventional exercises can improve the 
 abilities of patients to deal with daily activities and control body balance , which confirms 
 the viewpoints of many published studies9 , 10 . in addition , after treatment , the mbi scores were significantly lower in the control group 
 than those in the experimental group , and the bbs scores in the control group were also 
 lower than those in the experimental group . the outcomes demonstrate that compared with 
 conventional exercises , core stability exercises can result in better effectiveness in 
 patients with stroke - induced hemiplegia . however , in terms of comparison of the bbs scores 
 at the end of treatment , although the mean bbs score in the experimental group was larger 
 than that in the control group , there was no significant difference between the two groups . such a condition may be attributed to the relatively small sample size , and in a 
 larger - scale study , the difference between the two groups may be significant . consequently , 
 the outcomes in the present study can demonstrate that core stability exercises present with 
 better effectiveness than conventional exercises . first , the sample size was small , and a large - scale 
 clinical study may be better in a comparative study . second , the exercises results were 
 evaluated using self - reported measures of function instead of an objective measurement , and 
 this may have had some adverse influence on the final outcomes . third , there was a lack of 
 long - term follow - up in the study , and it is unclear whether the effectiveness of core 
 stability exercises will decrease in patients with hemiplegia with time .","[ purpose ] the aim of this study was to determine which is better in the rehabilitation of 
 stroke patients , core stability exercises or conventional exercises . [ subjects and 
 methods ] forty participants with hemiplegia were recruited in the department of neurology 
 of yidu central hospital of weifang between january 2014 and february 2015 and randomly 
 divided into either an experimental or control group . 
 the patients in the control group 
 performed conventional exercises for six weeks , and those in the experiment group 
 performed core stability exercises for six weeks . 
 the outcomes were evaluated using 
 modified barthel index and berg balance scale . 
 [ results ] after treatment , the modified 
 barthel index and berg balance scale were significantly increased in both groups when 
 compared with the baseline . 
 the modified barthel index was significantly lower in the 
 control group compared with the experimental group . 
 the berg balance scale scores in the 
 control group were relatively lower than those in the experimental group , but there was no 
 significant difference between the two groups .

"alopecia areata ( aa ) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the hair follicles and nails , its etiology is unknown , probably multifactorial with evident autoimmune and genetic components . the first clinical description of aa is attributed to celsus ( 14 - 37 b.c . ) and the designation aa was given by sauvages . the importance of genetic factors in aa is underlined by the high frequency of a positive family history in affected individuals . in most reports , these range from 10% to 20% of cases . a study in monozygotic and dizygotic pairs found a concordance rate of 55% for alopecia amongst monozygotic twins with no concordance among the dizygotic pairs . though it can affect any age group , demographical data on aa is still lacking . two brothers aged 5 and 7 years presented to the outpatient department with complaints of asymptomatic patchy loss of scalp hair for the past 2 and 4 months respectively . there was no similar complaint in any other family member , siblings and no history suggestive of systemic involvement , drug intake , trauma , pus filled lesions or any other skin eruptions . mucocutaneous examination revealed multiple smooth patches of alopecia ranging from 2 cm  2 cm to 4 cm  6 cm over occipital and vertex area of elder child and multiple patches over occipital and temporal region measuring 2 cm  2 cm to 2 cm  4 cm of the younger one [ figure 1a and b ] . ( a ) multiple areas of nonscarring alopecia involving the occipital and vertex area in a 7-year - old child ( b ) multiple areas of nonscarring alopecia involving the occipital and temporal area in sibling 5-year - old surface of the patches was smooth with no apparent changes . histopathological examination of the biopsy sample from the alopecia patch from the scalp confirmed the diagnosis , which showed inflammatory infiltrate in and around the bulbar region of hair follicle . alopecia areata is t cell mediated autoimmune disease with genetic predisposition resulting in partial and total nonscarring alopecia . scalp is the predominant site of involvement with the most common clinical pattern involving multiple areas of patchy hair loss . most patients develop aa before the age 40 years with 11 - 20% of all cases occurring in children . the ratio of male : female in aa in pediatric age group is 1:1 where as in adolescent and adult it is more common in female . human leukocyte antigen ( hla)-dq3 and hla - dqb1fnx0103 alleles appear to be marker for genetic susceptibility to aa with the latter serving as a special genetic marker for more severe variants . the diagnostic pathologic feature is peribulbar lymphocytic inflammation ( swarm of bees ) predominately cd4 + cells along with cd8 + t cells affecting anagen follicles or follicles in early catagen . short , easily extractable broken hairs , known as exclamation mark hairs , are often seen at the margins of the bald patches during active phases of the disease . the scalp is the first affected site in most cases , but any hair - bearing skin can be affected . the term alopecia totalis is applied to total or almost total loss of scalp hair , and alopecia universalis is the loss of all body hair . children with aa demonstrate an increased levels of activated t cells leading to various autoimmune diseases like vitiligo , thyroiditis , connective tissue disorders , lichen planus , type 1 diabetes , and pemphigus foliaceous . geometric and superficial pits are typical of aa whereas deep and irregularly distributed pits are seen in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . familial aggregation of aa has been studied and it has been found that estimated lifetime risk has been 7.1% in siblings , 7.8% in parents , 5.7% in offspring . aa has been also reported after allogenic bone marrow transplantation from an affected , hla matched sibling . menon and kiran reported a case of concomitant occurrence of aa in the sibling with emphasis on environmental precipitating factors . evidence based management of aa in children is limited due to the lack of well controlled randomized studies . reassurance should be given to patients with limited disease as spontaneous remission occurs in 80% of patients . various treatment options tried in aa are topical , intralesional , and systemic corticosteroids , topical immunomodulators , and topical irritants like dithranol , psoralen plus ultraviolet a therapy , excimer laser therapy .","alopecia areata ( aa ) is a t cell mediated autoimmune disease with multifactorial etiology resulting in partial and total nonscarring alopecia .

"the two hemispheres of the human brain are not equivalent . relative functional differences between the left and the right side of the brain , so - called functional hemispheric asymmetries , have been observed for several cognitive functions ( corballis , 2009 ) . for example , most individuals show a right - hemispheric dominance for visuo - spatial processing ( e.g. , vogel et al . , 2003 ) and a left - hemispheric dominance for production and processing of language ( e.g. , bethmann et al . , 2007 in addition to these functional hemispheric asymmetries , anatomical differences between the two sides of the brain ( e.g. , in volume or size of a certain area ) , so - called structural hemispheric asymmetries , have can be found in a wide range of brain regions ( e.g. , amunts , 2010 ) . several explanations for the emergence of hemispheric asymmetries have been given , including an enhancement of an individual s ability to perform two different tasks at the same time ( rogers et al . , 2004 ) , an increase in neural capacity due to an avoidance of unnecessary duplication of neural networks ( vallortigara , 2006 ) and the greater speed of uni - hemispheric processing since no interhemispheric transfer via the corpus callosum is needed ( ringo et al . , 1994 ) . historically , the scientific exploration of hemispheric asymmetries started with a seminal paper by a french surgeon called broca ( 1861 ) , who described a patient called monsieur tan because the only syllable he was able to generate was  tan . post - mortem analysis of this massively speech - impaired patient s brain revealed a large lesion in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus , an area now known as broca s area . this result indicated for the first time that the left hemisphere is highly relevant for language production . after this initial discovery in the language system , hemispheric asymmetries were thought to be uniquely human . in contrast to this view , left  right asymmetries of brain and behavior have now been observed in all vertebrate classes including mammals ( corballis , 2009 ) , birds ( rogers , 2008 ; george , 2010 ; gntrkn and manns , 2010 ) , reptiles ( bisazza et al . , 1998 ; bonati et al . , 2008 , 2010 ; csermely et al . , 2010 , 2011 ) , amphibians ( bisazza et al . , 1998 ; vallortigara , 2006 ) , bony fishes ( vallortigara and rogers , 2005 ; lippolis et al . , 2009 ; dadda et al . , 2010a ) , as well as cartilaginous , and jawless fishes ( concha and wilson , 2001 ) . recent evidence for asymmetrical organization in only distantly related invertebrate species , ranging from octopus vulgaris ( byrne et al . , 2002 ) to the honey bee apis mellifera ( rogers and vallortigara , 2008 ; frasnelli et al . , 2010 ) and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans ( taylor et al . , 2010 )  just to name a few examples  revealed that lateralization is indeed not restricted to humans , but constitutes a fundamental principle of nervous system organization . for example , chicks recognize familiar birds better with the left than with the right eye ( vallortigara , 1992 ) and react faster to a predator approaching from the left than from the right side ( vallortigara , 2006 ) , while most species fish show a consistent tendency to turn preferentially to one side when facing an obstacle while fleeing from a predator ( bisazza et al . , 2000 ) . these discoveries yield tremendous possibilities regarding the employment of model species in order to investigate the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of human brain asymmetry . unfortunately , there has never been a strong integration of research in humans and non - human animals in the field of hemispheric asymmetries , a circumstance that may be rooted in the assumption of human exceptionalism that dominated the field from early on ( taylor et al . , 2010 ) . in the present review , we argue that an interdisciplinary comparative approach , combining findings from psychology , biology , neuroscience , and genetics , provides a uniquely powerful tool in order to advance understanding of the ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes responsible for lateralization . for example , one field of research in which the integration of findings from diverse animal species has influenced current views about evolution and development of human lateralization is the study of language lateralization . about 95% of right - handers and 75% of left - handers show left - hemispheric language dominance ( bethmann et al . , 2007 ) , a feature that was widely thought to be uniquely human ( corballis , 2009 ) . contradictory to this view , evidence suggesting a left - hemispheric dominance for conspecific communication has now been observed not only in a wide variety of mammals like chimpanzees ( taglialatela et al . , 2008 ) , rhesus monkeys ( hauser and andersson , 1994 ) , gray mouse lemurs ( leliveld et al . , 2010 ) , dogs ( siniscalchi et al . , 2008 ) , mice ( ehret , 1987 ) , and sea lions ( bye et al . , 2005 ) but also in some non - mammalian vertebrate species like frogs ( bauer , 1993 ) . moreover , a left hypoglossal dominance has been reported in canaries ( nottebohm and nottebohm , 1976 ) . interestingly , it has been shown that animal communication asymmetries are modulated by the emotional content of the communicative sounds , with a greater involvement of the right hemisphere during production or perception of communicative sounds expressing or eliciting fear ( hook - costigan and rogers , 1998 ; siniscalchi et al . , 2008 ) . these findings parallel the right - hemispheric dominance for negative emotions in humans ( e.g. , onal - hartmann et al . , 2011 ) . taken together , while the evidence remains sparse for most vertebrate orders and certainly more research addressing this topic is needed , a recent cladographic comparative study ( ocklenburg et al . , 2011b ) concluded that there is convincing evidence for lateralization of production and perception of conspecific vocalization in several mammalian species , especially within the order of primates . thus , human language lateralization might not be due to a dominance of the left hemisphere for language as such , but rather due to a left - hemispheric dominance for more basic features of species - typical communicative sounds or their production ( bye et al . hence , lateralization of cognitive functions in the human brain did not necessarily emerge during human evolution . instead , it may have been incorporated into the functional architecture of cognitive functions of which some , like language , are unique to homo sapiens ( macneilage et al . , therefore , we will now focus on several key questions of human lateralization and will outline how a comparative approach could possibly help to elucidate them . a common conception is that functional asymmetries are a consequence of structural asymmetries in the brain ( wada , 2009 ) . traditionally , research regarding this question has focused on macroscopic gray matter asymmetries such as volume or shape of certain brain areas ( amunts , 2010 ) . however , it has been surprisingly difficult to find any clear - cut links between structural gray matter asymmetries in the human brain and left  right differences of behavior ( dos santos sequeira et al . , interestingly , evidence from recent studies in animal models suggests that structural asymmetries in connectivity patterns of homologous regions in the two hemispheres may be of greater functional relevance than asymmetries in region size or volume . one of the major animal models to investigate the neuronal foundations of hemispheric asymmetries is the visual system of birds . the left hemisphere is specialized for detailed object analysis , attends to local features and excels in the categorization of visual stimuli ( vallortigara et al . , 1996 ; yamazaki et al . , 2007 ) . in contrast , the right hemisphere extracts relational configurations of visual stimuli that can be relevant during spatial orientation ( vallortigara et al . , 2004 ; yamazaki et al . , 2007 ; rugani et al . , 2011 ) . additionally , the right hemisphere is in charge of visually guided social interactions ( rosa salva et al . , 2010 ) , fear and escape responses ( rogers , 2000 ; koboroff et al . , 2008 ) , sexual contacts ( glbetekin et al . , 2007 ) , and encoding of relational spatial information ( tommasi and vallortigara , 2001 ) . anatomical and physiological studies support this dissociation and demonstrated that asymmetrical projections of the ascending visual pathways underlie parts of these lateralized visual behaviors . like mammals , birds process visual information within two ascending pathways , the thalamofugal , and the tectofugal system ( see figure 1 ) . comparison of mammalian and avian ascending visual pathways and asymmetries of the tectofugal pathway in pigeons . ( a ) schematic sagittal view of the geniculostriate ( blue ) and extrageniculostriate ( orange , red ) projections in the monkey brain . brainstem and thalamic structures are depicted as transparent to visualize their position under the cortex . ( b ) schematic sagittal view of the thalamofugal ( blue ) and tectofugal ( orange , red ) pathways in the pigeon brain . ( c , d ) schematic frontal views of the forebrain and brainstem of the pigeon brain showing the thalamofugal ( c ) and the tectofugal ( d ) pathways . note the larger right - to - left projection of the tectorotundal efferents in the tectofugal system ( d ) . the organization of the sections in ( c , d ) shows all relevant components within the same plane and is not anatomically correct . abbreviations : gld , nucleus geniculatus lateralis pars dorsalis ; mt , middle temporal visual area ( also v5 ) ; v1 , primary visual cortex . the thalamofugal pathway corresponds to the mammalian geniculostriate system and transfers retinal information via the contralateral geniculate complex ( gld ) bilaterally onto the telencephalic visual wulst . the tectofugal system corresponds to the mammalian extrageniculostriate pathway and projects via the contralateral midbrain optic tectum and the thalamic nucleus rotundus to the telencephalic entopallium ( manns and gntrkn , 2009 ) . a wealth of studies has revealed connectional asymmetries in the thalamofugal and tectofugal pathways of both chicks and pigeons ( rogers , 2008 ) . for example , rajendra and rogers ( 1993 ) retrogradely traced projections from the dorsolateral anterior thalamus to the hyperpallium apicale ( old nomenclature : hyperstriatum accessorium ) in chicks and found that the ratio of labeled cells in the side of the thalamus contralateral to the injection site compared to the number of labeled cells in the side of the thalamus ipsilateral to the injection site was significantly greater for tracer injections in the right hemisphere compared to injections in the left hemisphere . in pigeons , the tectofugal pathway is the most important pathway for visually guided behavior . since the optic nerve of birds is essentially crossed and since pigeons have laterally placed eyes , retinal fibers of the tectofugal system create a uni - hemispheric representation of the contralateral visual field in the midbrain tectum . from there , tectal neurons project bilaterally onto the thalamic rotundus ( gntrkn et al . , 1993 ) . accordingly , rotundal and entopallial neurons often respond to visual stimulation from both eyes ( folta et al . , 2004 ) . however , the tectorotundal pathway has an asymmetry in its crossing component : more fibers cross from right tectum to left rotundus than from left tectum to right rotundus ( gntrkn et al . , 1998 ) . in line with the stronger bilateral input toward the left half of the brain , electrophysiological studies demonstrated that a higher number of left rotundal neurons respond to contralateral as well as ipsilateral visual input ( folta et al . , 2004 ) . thus , the left tectofugal pathway predominantly integrates input from both eyes and possibly enables a more complete representation of the visual scenery . this assumption was tested psychophysically by gntrkn and hahmann ( 1999 ) with unilateral rotundus lesions . they demonstrated that damages to the left rotundus led to a bilateral decrease in visual acuity whereas right - sided lesions only had a minor contralateral impact . in a further study , valencia - alfonso et al . ( 2009 ) trained pigeons in a task where each eye was exposed to different color pairs . ( learned with the contralateral eye ) and  unknown  ( learned ipsilaterally ) colors for each hemisphere . then , each eye / hemisphere was separately tested with a mixture of known and unknown color pairs . while discriminating known color pairs evinced no asymmetry , the left hemisphere demonstrated better performance in discriminating the unknown stimulus pair . thus , the left hemisphere had more access to information from the ipsilateral eye than the right hemisphere . this is a strong argument for the left hemisphere having a more bilateral representation of the visual input compared to the right hemisphere . in sum , the ascending tectofugal pathway displays a neuronal organization that creates an asymmetrical representation of the visual scene at the forebrain level . this enables the left hemisphere to process and to compare visual objects irrespective of their location within the whole visual scenery . this functional asymmetry results from left to right differences of white matter projections at the junction between midbrain and thalamus . in humans , much less is known about the relation between structural asymmetries in white matter projections and functional lateralization . a first clue comes from a recent diffusion tensor tractography study ( barrick et al . , 2007 ) in which two asymmetric white matter pathways were identified in the human brain : firstly , a rightward - asymmetric pathway connecting the posterior temporal lobe to the superior parietal lobule and secondly a leftward - asymmetric pathway connecting the parietal and frontal lobes to the temporal lobe . the authors suggest that the rightward - asymmetric pathway may be related to a rightward functional lateralization of auditory spatial attention and working memory whereas the leftward - asymmetric pathway may be related to leftward functional lateralization for language , but they did not test this assumption on a behavioral level . more direct evidence comes from a combined diffusion tensor imaging tractography and functional magnetic resonance imaging study in alcoholics and healthy controls ( schulte et al . , 2010 ) were it was observed that white matter fiber degradation in the corpus callosum due to alcoholism leads to an attenuated pattern of functional visuo - motor asymmetries . while these studies are only a first step , they nevertheless show that , parallel to the work that has been conducted in birds , it may indeed be a promising approach to further investigate the role of structural white matter asymmetries in the human brain in order to reveal the underlying neurophysiological processes of human functional hemispheric asymmetries . do non - genetic factors play a role in human asymmetry formation or not ? for handedness , some evidence suggests so , including the frequent observation of discordant handedness in monozygotic twins ( gurd , 2006 ) , the lower incidence of left - handedness in countries where the left hand is associated with uncleanliness ( zverev , 2006 ) , the higher incidence of left - handers among individuals born in spring and ensuing months than among individuals born during the rest of the year ( jones and martin , 2008 ) as well as parental influences on handedness ( laland , 2008 ) . for other types of functional hemispheric asymmetries , not much is known in humans . in birds , however , early ontogenetic signals have repeatedly been shown to play a crucial role for asymmetry formation and similar findings have also been reported for zebrafish ( andrew et al . , 2009 ) . avian embryos consistently keep their head turned such that the right eye is close to the egg shell and the left eye is occluded by the body ( kuo , 1932 ) . since breeding birds regularly turn their eggs and intermittently leave the nest , eggs are frequently exposed to light which traverses the egg shell and primarily stimulates the right eye ( buschmann et al . , 2006 ) . as a consequence , most chickens and pigeons develop right eye superiority in visual discrimination ( gntrkn et al . incubation in the dark prevents development of functional asymmetries ( rogers , 1982 ; zappia and rogers , 1983 ; deng and rogers , 2002 ) , and abolishes anatomical asymmetries within the visual pathways ( manns and gntrkn , 1999 ) . experimentally induced embryonic bilateral light exposure creates symmetrical posthatch performance ( deng and rogers , 2002 ) . embryonic ( rogers , 1990 ) or posthatch ( manns and gntrkn , 1999 ) visual stimulation of the left eye can even reverse behavioral asymmetry , in chicks and pigeons respectively . thus , normal rearing conditions correspond to right eye stimulation , resulting in left hemisphere superiority for visual object discrimination . this population bias is not genetically determined by factors within the visual system but by the lateralized epigenetic light factor that results from the genetically determined body position . the resulting asymmetry in visual object discrimination is mediated through activity differences between left and right retinal ganglion cells . since synaptic maturation of visual pathways is regulated by retinal activity ( ruthazer and cline , 2004 ) , transiently blocking right eye retinal activity in pigeons reverses visual asymmetry for the entire life ( prior et al . , 2004 ) . the lateralized retinal activation asymmetrically regulates tectal neurons , which in turn possibly release tectal brain derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) asymmetrically ( manns et al . , 2008 ) . bdnf affects synaptic transmission and controls neurite sprouting and maintenance ( cohen - cory and lom , 2004 ) . bdnf and the signaling cascade of its high - affinity receptor trkb are asymmetrically activated in response to embryonic light stimulation ( manns et al . , 2005 ) . the small g protein p21ras is a critical molecular switch for relaying neurotrophic actions into morphological changes . its amount within the pigeon s optic tectum depends on photic stimulation and consequently shows profound left it is likely that bdnf , trkb , and p21ras represent one of the biochemical pathways that translate a transient embryonic visual stimulation asymmetry into structural left right differences of the tectofugal system that then determine lateralized visually guided behavior for the entire lifespan of the animal . the biased embryonic photic input ignites several asymmetries ( object discrimination : rogers , 1990 ; left right discrimination : chiandetti and vallortigara , 2009 ) , while leaving others unaffected ( visual reaction to novelty : chiandetti et al . thus , the neuronal effects of lateralized embryonic visual stimulation only affect some of the visually guided functions . the development of visual object discrimination asymmetries in birds demonstrates that the establishment of a functional asymmetry can proceed along the same principles of synaptic plasticity that are already well known from other sensory systems . avian visual asymmetry results from an interaction between an epigenetic event ( left  right differences of light stimulation ) and a genetic factor ( embryonic right - turn of the head ; see figure 2 ; manns , 2006 ; manns and gntrkn , 2009 ) . sequence of relevant ontogenetic events that possibly constitute components of the development of visual asymmetry in pigeons . note the position of the head that is turned to the right such that the right eye is positioned close to the eggshell . the resulting biased light input before hatch is translated into morphological asymmetries of ascending visual pathways that then results in left the bottom picture shows an adult pigeon wearing an eye cap and participating in a pattern discrimination task . an asymmetrical environmental stimulation is able to induce the formation of structural and physiological left it is conceivable that such a critical role of a lateralized experience is not confined to sensory systems but also applies to the development of motor asymmetries as in the case of human handedness . for example , the ability of spinally controlled motor asymmetries to influence the cerebral cortex may represent a human corollary to the avian system ( ververs et al . , 1994 ) . in this case , early spinal asymmetries could act as lateralized  precursors  of asymmetrical cortical motor functions ( hiscock and kinsbourne , 1995 ) . but early motor asymmetries could also shape sensorimotor circuits of hand control in a lateralized way . like birds , humans have an early bias to turn the head to the right ( ververs et al . , 1994 ) . this early prenatal bias not only persists into adulthood ( gntrkn , 2003 ) but also correlates with right handedness ( ocklenburg and gntrkn , 2009 ) . this relation between head position and hand use could result from a higher probability of visuo - motor coupling between gaze position and the right hand during early childhood . to test the causal nature of this link , ocklenburg et al . ( 2010 ) studied children with torticollis , a condition that causes a subtle pathological tilt of the head to the left or to the right , in combination with a contralateral rotation of face and chin . the resulting head posture leads to an increased visual experience of the hand contralateral to the head - tilt and had a strong effect on handedness . relative to controls , children with torticollis had a higher probability of right- or left - handedness when having a head - tilt to the opposite side . thus , early biased sensory input or motor preference could modify lateralized systems of humans . the physiological mechanism underlying this modulation may be not identical to the impact of early visual stimulation of one eye in birds . nevertheless , these findings show that , comparable to birds , a non - genetic , experience - based factor can influence human lateralization . which genetic factors play a role in human asymmetry formation ? while there is very little doubt that handedness and language lateralization , the two most obvious examples of functional lateralization in humans , are , at least to some extent , genetically determined ( corballis , 2009 ) , the answer to this question proved to be surprisingly difficult to find . based on indirect statistical evidence , several authors suggested a common monogenetic background for these two traits ( e.g. , annett , 2002 ) . this view has repeatedly been questioned during recent years and it has been suggested that at least partly independent polygenic mechanisms for the inheritance of language lateralization and handedness exist ( e.g. , medland et al . , 2009 ; tzourio - mazoyer et al . , 2010 ) . the biggest problem of monogenic theories of handedness and language lateralization is that , despite continuous efforts to do so , no single gene has ever been identified that explains even remotely enough variance in behavioral lateralization data to qualify for a single gene explanation . moreover , a recent study found an effect of lrrtm1 on chromosome 2p12 ( a gene that is possibly involved in neural differentiation in the brain ) on handedness in a sample of dyslexic siblings , but not in a sample of healthy siblings ( francks et al . , 2007 ) . the authors therefore suggest that the effect of lrrtm1 on behavioral lateralization depends on other genetic and environmental factors in order to manifest and they concluded that handedness and brain lateralization are likely to be etiologically complex traits that are influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors ( francks et al . , 2007 ) . this conclusion was also recently supported by a genome - wide association study that reported an association of another gene ( pcsk6 ) with handedness in as dyslexic sample ( scerri et al . , 2011 ) . comparative studies on the genetics of brain lateralization also indicate that it is indeed highly unlikely that handedness and brain lateralization are determined by a single gene . the most widely used vertebrate model species in research on the genetic background of hemispheric asymmetries is the zebrafish ( danio rerio ) . the epithalamus of the zebrafish , a brain region consisting of the left and right habenula as well as the medial pineal organ and the parapineal organ , shows pronounced structural hemispheric asymmetries regarding its neuronal organization ( dadda et al . , 2010b ) . most notably , the parapineal organ lies to the left of the pineal organ in most individuals ( see figure 3 ) . leftward asymmetry of the parapineal organ in a zebrafish made visible by green fluorescent protein expression in a transgenic tg(foxd3:gfp)zf15 zebrafish ( modified from dadda et al . , 2010b ) . these epithalamic asymmetries are regulated by several genes in the nodal signaling pathway with the exact mechanisms having been reviewed elsewhere ( snelson and gamse , 2009 ; taylor et al . , 2010 ; roussign et al . , interestingly , when nodal genes are not expressed at all , epithalamic asymmetries are not absent , but their direction is determined at random ( concha et al . , 2000 ) . this shows that nodal genes only determine the direction of asymmetries but not their initial establishment ( concha et al . , 2000 ) , possibly indicating that another signaling pathway is relevant for initial symmetry breaking . recently , several studies have reported a link between the genetically controlled structural asymmetry in the zebrafish epithalamus and functional lateralization . for example , the commonly observed reversal of heart , gut , and structural diencephalic asymmetries in the frequent - situs - inversus ( fsi ) line of zebrafish is related to a reversal of functional asymmetries in several behavioral laterality tests , including mirror viewing and approaching a target to bite ( barth et al . , 2005 ) . these findings suggest that at least two different genetic mechanisms influence different forms of functional lateralization in the zebrafish ( barth et al . , 2005 ) . more recently , it has been reported that zebrafishes with a left or right parapineal organ show significant differences in several behavioral laterality tests , including eye preference for viewing their own reflection , eye use in predator inspection , rotational preference , and turning direction in the dark ( dadda et al . , 2010b ) , indicating a clear link between structural and functional asymmetry . apart from zebrafish , similar findings regarding habenular and behavioral asymmetry have also been observed in two different cichlid species ( reddon et al . not much is known about the relation of epithalamus structure and functional lateralization in humans , and human functional asymmetries are most likely driven by different genetic mechanisms . however , functional hemispheric lateralization is a conserved feature of the central nervous system in vertebrates ( vallortigara et al . , 1999 ; vallortigara and rogers , 2005 ; bianco et al . , 2008 ) and , as such , the findings in the zebrafish could possibly help to understand why no single gene determining handedness and language lateralization in humans has been found yet . from a comparative point of view , it is highly questionable that a trait like brain asymmetry which is determined by two complex polygenic signaling pathways in one vertebrate species is determined by only a single gene in another vertebrate species . thus , when viewing lateralization in h. sapiens from this perspective , it becomes clear that it is necessary to develop polygenic instead of monogenic theories for its ontogenesis . particularly , the idea that two different signaling pathways may control for the initial establishment and direction of asymmetries could fundamentally change theoretical approaches to asymmetry formation in humans . comparative approaches have greatly enhanced our understanding of several different human cognitive domains ( de waal and ferrari , 2010 ; haun et al . , 2010 ) . in line with these scientific success stories , comparative neuroscience also allows for unique insights into ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes responsible for human brain lateralization . these insights , however , are only parts of the whole story and it becomes increasingly clear that we are still far away from having a complete understanding of the complex interactions of non - genetic and genetic factors that underlie the neurophysiological processes that drive human functional hemispheric asymmetries . genetic and neuroscientific methods are rapidly advancing but we need to integrate the resulting insights into a broader comparative schema . to this end , it is fundamentally important to understand that human lateralization is not unique , but a trait that is shared with a multitude of other vertebrates . the idea of human exceptionalism had and still has a strong impact on lateralization research . only by abandoning this approach and viewing h. sapiens as one vertebrate species among many , we will be able to solve the riddle of functional hemispheric asymmetries in humans and other animals . the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .","hemispheric asymmetries play an important role in almost all cognitive functions . for more than a century , 
 they were considered to be uniquely human but now an increasing number of findings in all vertebrate classes make it likely that we inherited our asymmetries from common ancestors . 
 thus , studying animal models could provide unique insights into the mechanisms of lateralization . 
 we outline three such avenues of research by providing an overview of experiments on left 
 right differences in the connectivity of sensory systems , the embryonic determinants of brain asymmetries , and the genetics of lateralization . 
 all these lines of studies could provide a wealth of insights into our own asymmetries that should and will be exploited by future analyses .",144
"in most cancer metastases , cancer cells migrate from the primary tumor to other parts of the body through the near regional lymph nodes . the first lymph node or group of lymph nodes in the direct lymphatic drainage pathway that extends from the site of the tumor is called the sentinel lymph node ( sln ) , and is used to represent the status of lymphatic spread.13 decisions as to the extent of surgical treatment are usually based on whether or not patients have sln involvement . therefore , sln mapping and biopsy are important techniques in cancer therapy . reactive blue dye staining , radiocolloid tracers , and a combination of both , are techniques that are widely used for sln mapping in the clinic . however , blue - dyed slns located in deep tissue can only be observed after they have been exposed to air , and more extensive surgery is therefore required to find them . the disadvantages of radiocolloid tracers include exposure of the patient to radioactivity and painful peritumoral injections of radiocolloid.4,5 in comparison with the above three commonly used techniques , noninvasive in vivo near infrared fluorescence imaging when used for sln mapping has several advantages . for example , slns in deep tissue can be observed directly due to near infrared fluorescence without the need for excessive excision of skin and muscle , which enables rapid detection of slns by surgeons . in addition , the surgeon can conveniently confirm through visual inspection that all of the slns have been removed from the node field.6 near infrared fluorescent reagents for sln mapping include organic dyes ( eg , indocyanine green79 and methylene blue)10,11 and inorganic nanoparticles ( eg , quantum dots1215 and carbon dots16 ) . organic dyes may be favored over inorganic nanoparticles because the former have lower toxicity and quicker in vivo clearance speeds . in the present study , we report the first use of chlorophyll extracted from the leaf of chimonanthus salicifolius for mouse axillary sln mapping . the choice of this chinese herb ( which is usually used to getting rid of heat in summertime and stimulating appetite ) is based on its nontoxic properties . in addition , c. salicifolius has a wide distribution in the south of china . c. salicifolius is a shrub that grows up to 4 m tall . it has been found that chlorophyll a and b are the most common types of chlorophyll in almost all of the higher plants.17 chlorophyll is structurally similar to porphyrin ( a fluorescent dye ) and has near infrared fluorescence . additionally , chlorophyll has been registered as a food additive , and a variety of foods and beverages are permitted to contain cholorophyll.18 therefore , chlorophyll is a safe fluorescent material which has great potential for in vivo bioimaging . however , chlorophyll is a poorly water - soluble dye . to improve its water solubility and enable it to target slns for imaging , chlorophyll in this study liposomes are spherical vesicles made up of a lipid bilayer , and are often used as a drug delivery system . it has been reported that liposomes can serve as carriers for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic drugs ( or agents ) targeted to the lymphatic system.1922 in our study , we used low - cost soybean lecithin as the lipid membrane when preparing the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites for sln mapping . the dry leaves of c. salicifolius were obtained from tongji university - lishui institute ( lishui , zhejiang province , china ) . soybean lecithin ( purity > 90% ) and cholesterol were acquired from sinopharm chemical reagent co , ltd ( shanghai , china ) . nude mice aged 56 weeks and weighing 1822 g were purchased from the shanghai sipper -

bottomed flask containing 1 ml of chloroform , and dried using a rotary evaporator ( re52cs , shanghai yarong chemical equipment co , ltd , shanghai , china ) to remove the last traces of chloroform with nitrogen flow . next , 2 ml of distilled water was added to the flask to hydrate the dry lipid film , and the mixture was gently shaken for about 10 minutes , followed by sonication for at least 90 minutes . the precipitate of free chlorophyll in the flask bottom could be observed during the 20 hours of storage period due to its poor solubility . the upper suspension ( about 1.5 ml ) was collected and the liposome - coated chlorophyll was thus obtained . ultraviolet - visible absorption spectra were obtained using a diode array spectrophotometer ( uv-2102pc , unico , beijing , china ) with a deuterium lamp source . fluorescence spectra excited by 400 nm were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer ( f-2500 , hitachi , japan ) equipped with a xenon lamp source . for the detection of fluorescence stability , the samples were placed in 1 cm quartz cuvettes and continuously excited at 365 nm over a period of one hour using an ultraviolet detector ( zf , kanghua , shanghai , china ) . during the irradiation process , the fluorescence spectra of the samples were measured . the bright fields of the chlorophyll dissolved in ethanol , chlorophyll dispersed in water , and liposome -

pass ) , respectively . the liposome - coated chlorophyll aqueous suspensions were air - dried onto carbon - coated grids , and then examined at 80 kv using a transmission electron microscope ( tem , jsm-6360 lv , jeol , tokyo , japan ) . the size distributions were measured by means of tem analysis of 122 particles . to measure the hydrodynamic size of the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites in serum , the nanocomposite precipitate was dispersed in 100% fetal calf serum , and the size was ascertained using photon correlation spectroscopy ( 3000hs , malvern instruments , worcestershire , uk ) . normal liver cells ( qsg-7701 ) were cultured on a 96-well plate using rpmi-1640 as the culture medium . the medium contained 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic - antimycotic at 37c and culture plates were maintained in an incubation chamber containing 5% co2 . for the mtt assay , 10 l of chlorophyll and liposome - coated chlorophyll aqueous suspensions containing 0 , 5.8 , 11.6 , 23.1 , and 46.2 g / ml of chlorophyll were added to the cells . after a 2-hour incubation , 10 l of mtt ( 5 mg / ml ) was added to the cells . after an interval of 4 hours , the suspensions were replaced with 100 l of dimethyl sulfoxide and the cell viabilities were determined by measuring their absorbance at 490 nm using a flexstation iii enzyme - labeled instrument ( molecular devices , sunnyvale , ca ) . to detect viability of the macrophage cells ( ana-1 ) , these cells were incubated with 10 l of chlorophyll and liposome - coated chlorophyll ( containing 0 , 5.8 , 11.6 , 23.1 , and 46.2 g / ml of chlorophyll ) for 24 , 48 , and 72 hours , respectively , and their viabilities chlorophyll 40 l and liposome - coated chlorophyll aqueous suspensions ( containing 1.5 mg / ml of chlorophyll ) were injected into two nude mice through the tail vein . mouse fluorescence images were obtained using the in vivo imaging system ( nightowl lb983 , berthold technologies , bad wildbad , germany ) . the excitation wavelength was 630 nm and the emission filter was 700 nm ( long - pass ) , and the exposure time was 0.1 seconds . chlorophyll 80 l and liposome - coated chlorophyll aqueous suspensions ( containing 1.48 mg / ml of chlorophyll ) were injected intradermally into the paws of two nude mice . all of the injection methods ( including injection depth and angle related to the plane of the paw ) were the same . the excitation wavelength was 635 nm and the emission wavelength was 675 nm ( long - pass ) . all of the collected images were analyzed using the maestro software provided with the system . after the in vivo imaging had been completed , the lymph nodes in the axillary location at the injection sites were resected for fluorescence imaging . as a control , a lymph node in the axillary location of a mouse that had not been injected with chlorophyll the dry leaves of c. salicifolius were obtained from tongji university -

 c. salicifolius is a taller plant , and such plants have abundant chlorophyll a and b.17 the bright field colors of the liposome - coated chlorophyll aqueous suspensions were deeper than those of the chlorophyll aqueous suspensions alone ( figure 2a ) . inductively - coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometric analysis showed that 1 mg of liposomes could load 21.9 g of chlorophyll . an interesting finding was that the fluorescent intensities of liposome - coated chlorophyll were obviously higher than those of chlorophyll alone ( figure 2b ) . for example , when the concentrations of chlorophyll were 46.2 , 23.1 , and 11.6 g / ml , the fluorescent intensities of liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites were 22.2 , 20.8 , and 25.0 times higher , respectively , than those of the chlorophyll alone ( figure 2b ) . however , chlorophyll molecules can be highly dispersed within the long chains of fatty acids in the lipid membrane of the liposome . therefore , when the chlorophyll was dispersed in water , we found that the aqueous suspensions of chlorophyll contained visible particles that would precipitate in several hours . on the other hand , the aqueous suspensions of the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposite were uniform , and no obvious precipitates could be observed over a week . chlorophyll when dispersed in water has near infrared fluorescence at a wavelength of 679 nm . after liposome encapsulation , the fluorescent peaks of liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites shifted to blue by only 12 nm , as compared with those of chlorophyll alone ( figure 2b ) . this suggests that the liposome coating did not obviously affect the near infrared fluorescence of chlorophyll when penetrating deep animal tissue . since the chlorophyll tends to precipitate in water , here we only measured the fluorescent stability of the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites in water . after being continuously excited by a 365 nm light for 60 minutes , the fluorescent spectrum of the nanocomposites did not shift , and the fluorescent intensity decreased by only 8.2% ( figure 3 ) . this indicated that the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites have potential for comparatively long - term imaging , which is of benefit for biomedical applications . the tem image shows that the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites are spherical in shape and have a comparatively narrow size distribution ( average diameter 21.7  6.0 nm , figure 4a and b ) . nanocomposites with such a small diameter are suitable for sln mapping because the ideal contrast agent should be 1050 nm in size.24,25 the chlorophyll molecules may be well dispersed in the liposome vesicles because chlorophyll exists in water as crystals , and virtually no free crystals could be observed around the liposome- coated chlorophyll nanocomposites . although the average hydrodynamic size of the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites in 100% fetal calf serum is 263.4  24.0 nm ( figure 4c ) , liposomes are limp nanoparticles and may penetrate small pores in vivo . for example , to prepare different - sized liposomes , large liposomes are usually extruded in turn through polycarbonate membrane filters with different pore diameters ( eg , 450 , 220 , and 150 nm ) . as shown in figure 5 , the mtt assay demonstrated that normal liver cell ( qsg-7701 ) viability did not decrease obviously after the cells had been incubated with either chlorophyll or liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites for 2 hours . the viability of the macrophages ( ana-1 ) was also not obviously affected by the chlorophyll and liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites after the ana-1 cells had been incubated with these materials for 24 and 48 hours . it should be noted that ana-1 cell viability was between 83.1%  4.4% and 88.7%  2.3% when the cells were incubated with chlorophyll and liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites , respectively , for 72 hours . this indicates that the chlorophyll may exhibit low toxicity if this material exists in cells for 3 days . , we found that many liposome- coated chlorophyll nanocomposites might be removed from the mouse body 94 minutes after intravenous injection via the tail . this elimination process can be observed clearly through the fluorescence of liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites in vivo ( figure 6 ) . this suggests that the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites may be safely used in clinical imaging because they can be metabolized by the animal body . in addition , the near infrared fluorescence of liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites inside the mouse body could be seen at different sites through the skin and muscle after the mouse had been injected with these nanocomposites via the tail vein ( figure 7 ) . for example , the fluorescence of these nanocomposites in the mouse liver could be captured by the in vivo imaging system from the right recumbent , left recumbent , supine , and prone positions . therefore , the depth of tissue penetration of chlorophyll near infrared fluorescence may be at least 35 mm . axillary and cervical lymph nodes are usually located at deeper subcutaneous positions , so that near infrared fluorescence imaging is suitable for mapping of these lymph nodes . in this work , we injected 80 l of liposome - coated chlorophyll aqueous suspension containing 1.5 mg / ml of chlorophyll intradermally into a nude mouse paw . we then monitored migration of the chlorophyll into the axillary sln by means of near infrared fluorescence using an in vivo imaging system . as a control , the paw of another nude mouse was synchronously injected with 80 l of liposome - free chlorophyll aqueous suspension , also containing 1.48 mg / ml of chlorophyll , and then monitored using the same methods as described above . as shown in figure 8 , the axillary region emitted bright fluorescence one minute after injection of liposome- coated chlorophyll nanocomposites . this fluorescent spot could still be observed clearly in real time at 60 minutes after injection , without the need to excise skin and muscle . the axillary region of another mouse also emitted fluorescence a short time after being injected with the liposome - free chlorophyll , but the intensity of the fluorescence was lower than that in the axillary region of the mouse injected with the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposite . to verify whether the fluorescent spots were slns , we resected the slns at approximately 2 hours after injection and then imaged them using the in vivo imaging system ( figure 9 ) . the sln from the mouse injected with liposome - coated chlorophyll was brighter than that from the mouse injected with chlorophyll alone . this may have been because the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites had brighter fluorescence than the chlorophyll alone , and more chlorophyll was targeted at the axillary lymphatic system due to liposome delivery . this phenomenon may be very important for the surgeon because the slns can be observed clearly in real time . the bright red fluorescence emitted by the slns must originate from the chlorophyll , because the sln of a control mouse that was not injected with chlorophyll did not emit red fluorescence . in summary , chlorophyll extracted from the leaves of c. salicifolius was encapsulated into liposomes and used for the first time in sln mapping . due to the fact that the lipophilic chlorophyll can be well dispersed in liposomes , the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites not only improved the solubility of the poorly water - soluble chlorophyll , but also significantly improved the near infrared fluorescence of the chlorophyll . no or low toxicity was detected after incubation of cells with chlorophyll for 3 days , whether alone or encapsulated in liposomes . although the mouse axillary slns can be observed to fluoresce rapidly after injection of either chlorophyll or liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites , the sln of the mouse injected with liposome - coated chlorophyll emitted brighter fluorescence than that of the mouse injected with chlorophyll alone . the slns embedded in deep tissues could be observed directly through near infrared fluorescence without the need for exposure of the slns to air . on the basis of these findings , it is believed that the use of near infrared fluorescence from liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites has clinical promise for sln mapping .","backgroundsentinel lymph node ( sln ) mapping using in vivo near infrared fluorescence imaging has attracted great attention during the past few years . here 
 we report on the early use of poorly water - soluble chlorophyll with near infrared fluorescence extracted from the leaf of chimonanthus salicifolius , for mouse axillary sln mapping.methods and resultsto improve the water solubility and sln targeting of the chlorophyll , we encapsulated the chlorophyll in nanoscale liposomes . 
 the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites obtained were spherical in shape and had an average diameter of 21.7  6.0 nm . the nanocomposites dispersed well in water , and in aqueous suspension they exhibited brighter near infrared fluorescence than chlorophyll alone . 
 after incubation of the nanocomposites with normal liver cells ( qsg-7701 ) and macrophage cells ( ana-1 ) for no more than 48 hours , there was no obvious reduction in cell viability . 
 when the nanocomposites were injected intradermally into the paw of a mouse , the axillary sln was found to be strongly fluorescent and was easily visualized in real time without a requirement for surgery . 
 the intensity of the near infrared fluorescence emitted by the sln was obviously brighter than that emitted by the sln of another mouse that had been intradermally injected with chlorophyll alone.conclusionour data show that the liposome - coated chlorophyll nanocomposites could have great potential for clinical sln mapping due to their lack of toxicity , bright near infrared fluorescence , and small diameter .",329
"it is caused by an abnormal number of coronary angiography ( cag ) trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene ( htt ) , which encodes a 350 kda ubiquitously expressed protein , huntingtin ( htt).1 hd is characterized by movement disorder , cognitive impairment , dementia , and affective disturbances.2 hd patients have more than 40 cag repeats and show abnormal involuntary writhing movements . juvenile hd patients have more than 60 cag repeats.1,3 the age of onset of hd is typically between 35 and 44 years old . a htt comprising more than 40 cag repeats is translated into mutant huntingtin ( mhtt ) protein , which causes the death of medium spiny neurons in the striatum . normal htt is ubiquitously expressed and is essential for embryonic development.4 the mechanism of neuronal cell death by mhtt has not been clearly established although previous studies report that it has been linked with mitochondrial dysfunction , transcriptional dysregulation , altered protein - protein interactions , abnormal protein aggregations , and excitotoxicity.57 the treatment paradigm for hd patients depends on 3 main clinical domains : movement , psychiatric , and cognitive abnormalities . antipsychotic agents , including haloperidol , pimozide , and clozapine , are used to treat patients with psychiatric / behavioral comorbidities . furthermore , comparison of the available treatment studies is problematic due to differences in study populations , variable outcomes , the use of different instruments , and the confounding effects of drugs . the pharmacological treatment of hd can alleviate symptoms , but it can not cure the disease . the ultimate goal of cell therapy is the replacement or neuroprotection of dead or dying cells . cell therapy strategies can be classified into two broad categories based on the use of either fetal tissues / cells or stem cells . studies using fetal brain tissue were performed using animal models of hd prior to 1990 . however , effective recovery has not been reported in any clinical trials , although some studies showed that fetal tissue transplantation provided cellular improvement around lesions.34,35 moreover , fetal tissue transplantation led to localized effects only and did not persist long - term.34,36 stem cells are being studied in various disease models , in preference to fetal tissue or cells due to the limited availability of the latter . several types of stem cells , such as embryonic stem cells ( escs ) , bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( bm - mscs ) , neural stem cells ( nscs ) , adipose stem cells ( ascs ) , and induced pluripotent stem cells ( ipscs ) , are used to develop cell therapy strategies . embryonic stem cells are pluripotent , and mouse escs can differentiate into neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes.37 it has been reported that human escs ( hescs ) can differentiate into neurons in the lesions of hd animal models , attenuating progressive symptoms.38 despite these benefits of hescs , complications arising from their use include immune rejection , ethical concerns , and tumor formation.38 on the other hand , somatic stem cells such as bm - mscs , nscs , ascs , and ipss are ideal sources for clinical trials because these stem cells do not present the above mentioned immune rejection and ethical problems . murine and human nscs ( hnscs ) have been studied in vivo as cell therapy sources for hd . a study involving an hnsc treated hd animal group investigated the migration of transplanted hnscs around a lesion site . following tail vein or ventricle injection , a significantly greater volume of striatum was observed in the treatment group compared to the control group . other studies reported that transplanted nscs differentiated into neurons , oligodendrocytes , and predominantly , astrocytes , in in vivo hd models , resulting in partial functional recovery.3842 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and ascs are easily obtained multipotent somatic stem cells that can be differentiated into neuronal cells . moreover , these stem cells have the ability to secrete neuroprotective factors , such as growth factors , chemokines , and cytokines . recent studies have shown that intrastriatal transplantation of bm - mscs reduced striatal atrophy , although transplanted cells only survived for up to 7 days in transgenic hd mice . bm - mscs can be genetically modified to provide sustained and long - term delivery of neuroprotective factors , which increase neurogenesis and protect against cell death.4345 genetically modified mscs are currently under consideration for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders , including hd.46 adipose stem cells are a feasible source for cellular therapy due to ease of isolation , manipulation , and a strong safety profile in the clinic . the intrastriatal transplantation of normal human ascs reduced lesion volumes in an hd rat model.47 to examine the long - term effect of asc transplantation and investigate the possibility of autologous asc transplantation in hd patients , hd patient - derived ascs have been investigated over a period of 4 months in the yac128 model.48 the results showed similar expression levels of growth factors , such as brain derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , and leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) , in hd ascs compared with normal human ascs . however , no long - term effects of transplantation with either hd or normal ascs were observed in yac128 . embryonic stem cells have two limitations regarding their clinic application : the ethical issues surrounding their use and allogenic immune rejection . ipscs provide a potential solution because they have the ability to differentiate into various cell types and can be induced from the fibroblasts of an hd patient.49,50 ipscs from an hd patient with 72 cag repeats have been efficiently induced to form gamma- aminobutyric acid neurons and were functional following transplantation into a rat model of hd.51 although stem cells have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell , recent studies indicate that the beneficial effects of stem cell therapies actually occur via secretory molecules in addition to cell replacement , the so - called paracrine effect.47,52 stem cells secrete a variety of growth factors , cytokines , and chemokines that regulate their biology in an autocrine/ paracrine manner , and they interact with the surrounding microenvironment.53,54 vegf , hgf , insulin- like growth factor-1 and -2 ( igf-1 , -2 ) and stromal- derived factor-1 secreted from stem cells are important to neuronal survival , neurogenesis , and mitochondrial activation via a bystander - like mechanism . 47,55,56 these positive effects on recipient neural cells result in protection and repair , leading to the inhibition of hd progression ( figure 1 ) . they secrete multiple antiapoptotic growth factors , including vegf , hgf , bdnf , basic fibroblast growth factor , and igf-1.5759 one solution to the problem of stem cell availability may be the paracrine effect of ascs . the paracrine effects of human ascs on hd pathology were investigated in cell culture experiments and hd r6/2 mouse models.47 transplantation of ascs resulted in reduced lesion volume and fewer apoptotic striatal cells in the hd rat model compared with control animals . the asc transplanted group showed significant improvement in apomorphine- induced rotation tests via the paracrine effect . ascs have been injected into the r6/2 hd mouse model , and treated mice exhibited a significantly longer survival time than control mice . the paracrine effect of ascs in the r6/2 hd mouse model was also investigated.60 asc extracts were isolated and used to treat r6/2 mice via intraperitoneal injection . the results were similar to those obtained from stem cell transplantation , suggesting that the injection of these stem cell extracts could also slow hd progression.60 taken together , the use of growth factors in hd could be an ideal stem cell strategy to protect against neuronal death , given that stem cells from an hd patient have the genetic components for autologous transplantation therapies . to implement this therapy , further works are required to elucidate the precise mechanism of the paracrine effects of asc extracts . prior to clinical application , thorough in vivo studies examining the delivery method , toxicity , and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic candidates are required . most of these drugs do not demonstrate significant effects , although several drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials . stem cell therapy is an effective strategy for curing hd , and many preclinical trials show encouraging results . although the precise mechanism of the stem cell paracrine effect has not been completely elucidated , this strategy has potential for clinical application .","huntington s disease ( hd ) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder . 
 the most common symptom of hd is abnormal involuntary writhing movements , called chorea . 
 antipsychotics and tetrabenazine are used to alleviate the signs and symptoms of hd . 
 stem cells have been investigated for use in neurodegenerative disorders to develop cell therapy strategies . 
 recent evidence indicates that the beneficial effects of stem cell therapies are actually mediated by secretory molecules , as well as cell replacement . 
 although stem cell studies show that cell transplantation provides cellular improvement around lesions in in vivo models , further work is required to elucidate some issues before the clinical application of stem cells .

"statins ( 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitors ) were introduced in denmark in 1990 and are currently recommended as a preventive treatment for men and women of all ages at high risk of cardiovascular events.1 during the past two decades , statins have become one of the most commonly used groups of drugs worldwide . between 1995 and 2012 , 842,484 danish individuals ( the current population of denmark is 5.6 million ) filled at least one statin prescription at a community pharmacy , according to data from the danish national board of health.2 in the 1990s , there was a four- to fivefold increase in numbers of new patients who received statins.3 the prevalence of statin use in denmark was predicted to increase by over 300% between 2006 and 2012,4 based on a continuous rise in new users after 2005 . compliance with statin treatment was rated high in denmark in the 1990s,5 but others have raised concerns regarding persistence of use , with reports of a large number of dropouts in short - term studies.6 while clinical studies often focus on middle- and low - risk populations , population - based studies may focus on real - life data , including high - risk populations.710 clinical trials have demonstrated that the most widely prescribed statins ( ie , simvastatin , atorvastatin , rosuvastatin , and pravastatin ) for both primary and secondary prevention purposes reduce total plasma cholesterol and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol ; reductions of 0.52.26 mmol / l for total and ldl cholesterol levels , respectively , were reported in a meta - analysis of 181 randomized controlled trials of statin.11 on the other hand , the cholesterol level target attainment in routine clinical care is less well described , with somewhat inconsistent results . among 2,227 elderly medicare advantage members in the us , 67%94% reached the ldl cholesterol goal , depending on statin type prescribed.7 in their study of 2,303 patients starting statins in the netherlands , heintjes et al8 stratified cholesterol target attainment by patients risk for cardiovascular disease ; among high - risk patients , target attainment varied from 40% for patients on pravastatin to 81% for patients on rosuvastatin . in a population - based cohort study in spain , 74% of patients did not attain their ldl cholesterol treatment goal after 3 years of follow - up.9 in contrast , among 1,103 patients from community - based practices in canada who filled prescriptions for statins , 73% achieved the target ldl cholesterol level.10 in the current population - based study , we examined the rate of patients initiating statin use and the prevalence of use in northern denmark during 200410 , a setting in which national guidelines recommend using simvastatin as first - line drug . in addition , we aim to examine changes in lipid values over time after statin initiation and determined the percentage of patients attaining treatment goals for cholesterol levels , stratified by risk groups , and whether statin type was switched . denmark provides tax - funded universal access to primary and secondary health care , with no substantial out - of - pocket expenses and with partial reimbursement for most prescribed medications , including statins . individual -

lowering drugs , antithrombotics , and oral anticoagulants . the clinical laboratory information system ( labka ) research database contains information on blood samples obtained by primary care and hospital physicians and analyzed at hospitals in northern denmark since 2000.15 from the labka database we collected information on total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , sample dates , and results during 200410 . in total , 76% ( 123,743/161,646 ) of patients had one or more cholesterol measurements before and one after statin initiation . based on international and national guidelines1619 we defined three risk groups , based on availability of information in the hospital contact and prescription registries , and determined the achievement of target cholesterol levels in each group . the first group contained a very high - risk group of patients with a hospital - based diagnosis of cardiovascular disease , whose targets were < 1.8 mmol / l for ldl cholesterol and < 4 mmol / l for total cholesterol . the second group consisted of a high - risk group of patients with diabetes ( receiving antidiabetic medications or with a history of hospitalization or outpatient care for diabetes ) , hypertension , or a diagnosis of familial dyslipidemia , whose targets were < 2.5 mmol / l for ldl cholesterol and < 4.5 mmol / l for total cholesterol . the third group contained the remaining patients with low to moderate risk , whose targets were <3 mmol / l for ldl cholesterol and < 5 mmol / l for total cholesterol . this study was approved by the danish data protection agency ( record number 2009 -

years ( figure 1a ) . the annual number of patients initiated on statins increased until 2008 ( 19.9 per 1,000 person - years ) and then decreased until 2010 ( 14.1 per 1,000 person - years ) . figure 1b shows the resulting cumulative prevalence of statin use up to 2010 . in 2010 , there were 133,979 adults , corresponding to 93.8 per 1,000 adults ( aged between 18 and 86 years ) , in northern denmark who still used statins and who had initiated their statin use between 2004 and 2010 . at statin initiation among the 161,646 patients , 98% started with simvastatin . demographic characteristics varied little between users of different statin types . sixty percent of patients were aged between 55 and 75 years at statin initiation , and 51% were men ( table 1 ) . as expected , many patients had previous hospital - based diagnoses of heart disease and other chronic conditions ( table 2 ) . in general , patients initiated on statins during 200410 were on statin treatment for a median of 1,075 days , or close to 3 years . in this period , for example , the proportion of simvastatin users who started with 40 mg tablets increased from 40% in 2004 to 75% in 2010 , and the proportion of rosuvastatin users who started with high doses ( 20 mg or 40 mg ) increased from 12% in 2004 to 21% in 2010 . overall , the average mpr for the entire period was 0.93 ( interquartile range [ iqr ] 0.771.0 ) . of the statin initiators in this sample , 88% ( 142,807/161,646 ) did not switch statin type . of these 142,807 nonswitchers , only 18% ( 24,998/142,807 ) altered their statin dose during the study period . of the 18,839 ( 12% ) persons who did switch one or more times , 13,138 ( 70% ) switched only once . by far the most common initial switches were from simvastatin to atorvastatin ( 48% ; 9,104/18,839 ) , to rosuvastatin ( 35% ; 6,644/18,839 ) , or to pravastatin ( 9% ; 1,603/18,839 ) . for example , 21% versus 11% had chronic ischemic heart disease and 11% versus 8% had a previous myocardial infarction . in contrast , the prevalence of other important comorbidities ( eg , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) was similar to that in nonswitchers . the sex and age distributions among statin switchers and nonswitchers were similar ( 51% males among nonswitchers and 48% among switchers ; 40% aged over 65 years among nonswitchers and 39% among switchers ) . the mpr for the nonswitchers was 0.93 ( iqr 0.781.0 ) , while the mpr for the patients who switched statin type was 0.90 ( iqr 0.751.0 ) preswitch and 0.93 ( iqr 0.701.0 ) postswitch . among the statin initiators , 26,314 persons ( 16% ) completely stopped their statin treatment : ie , were nonpersistent . compared with all patients who started statins , nonpersistent patients were more likely to be very young ( aged < 45 years ) or very old ( aged > 75 years ) , more likely to live in small municipalities in rural areas , more likely to be divorced , and importantly  had a slightly higher prevalence of almost all examined diagnoses of comorbidity , including cardiovascular disease ( data not shown ) . among the 133,856 patients with at least one cholesterol measurement recorded prior to their first statin prescription , the most recent cholesterol measurement was , on average , 9 days ( quartiles 528 days ) before redemption of a statin prescription . furthermore , 123,743 patients had at least one cholesterol surveillance measurement ( median 80 days ) after starting to use statins . the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with and without cholesterol measurements recorded in the database were very similar , except that more patients without measurement lived in large cities ( 29% vs 8% ) , and more patients without measurement ( 49% vs 38% ) started statin treatment early in the period ( 200406 ) , when the laboratory database may have been less complete . median total cholesterol in new statin users decreased from 6.3 ( quartiles 5.57.0 ) mmol / l at the most recent measurement before statin initiation to 4.5 ( quartiles 3.95.1 ) mmol / l at the first measurement after initiation , and remained remarkably stable thereafter ( figure 2a ) , corresponding to a reduction of 28% . median ldl cholesterol decreased rapidly from 4.0 ( quartiles 3.34.6 ) mmol / l to 2.3 ( quartiles 1.92.8 ) mmol / l , corresponding to a reduction of 43% . median hdl cholesterol remained stable at 1.4 mmol / l before and after statin initiation . among patients who later switched statin type , there was a smaller initial decrease in cholesterol values compared with nonswitchers , and some increase in cholesterol levels after the first surveillance measurement ( figure 2b ) . among patients who switched statin type , we observed a modest reduction in cholesterol level after their switch ( figure 2c ) . table 3 shows attainment of target cholesterol levels by risk group . among all statin users , 66% of patients in the very high - risk group reached their target value for total cholesterol , while corresponding figures were 74% and 80% for patients in the high - risk and low- to moderate - risk groups , respectively . when stratified by switching of statin type ( yes / no ) , results for statin nonswitchers were comparable with the overall results . among patients who switched statin type , the percentages attaining target cholesterol levels after the first switch and before the second were 46% , 56% , and 64% for the three risk groups , respectively . when focusing on target attainment at the very first measurement after statin initiation ( averaging 3 months after statin start ) , 43% in the very high - risk , 49% in the high - risk , and 55% in the low- to moderate - risk groups reached total cholesterol target . in total , there were 161,646 statin patients initiated on statins in northern denmark between 2004 and 2010 . in 2004 , there were 16.3 new users per 1,000 person - years ( figure 1a ) . the annual number of patients initiated on statins increased until 2008 ( 19.9 per 1,000 person - years ) and then decreased until 2010 ( 14.1 per 1,000 person - years ) . figure 1b shows the resulting cumulative prevalence of statin use up to 2010 . in 2010 , there were 133,979 adults , corresponding to 93.8 per 1,000 adults ( aged between 18 and 86 years ) , in northern denmark who still used statins and who had initiated their statin use between 2004 and 2010 . demographic characteristics varied little between users of different statin types . sixty percent of patients were aged between 55 and 75 years at statin initiation , and 51% were men ( table 1 ) . as expected , many patients had previous hospital - based diagnoses of heart disease and other chronic conditions ( table 2 ) . in general , initial use of statins other than simvastatin was associated with higher baseline comorbidity . patients initiated on statins during 200410 were on statin treatment for a median of 1,075 days , or close to 3 years . in this period , for example , the proportion of simvastatin users who started with 40 mg tablets increased from 40% in 2004 to 75% in 2010 , and the proportion of rosuvastatin users who started with high doses ( 20 mg or 40 mg ) increased from 12% in 2004 to 21% in 2010 . overall , the average mpr for the entire period was 0.93 ( interquartile range [ iqr ] 0.771.0 ) . of the statin initiators in this sample , 88% ( 142,807/161,646 ) did not switch statin type . of these 142,807 nonswitchers , only 18% ( 24,998/142,807 ) altered their statin dose during the study period . of the 18,839 ( 12% ) persons who did switch one or more times , 13,138 ( 70% ) switched only once . by far the most common initial switches were from simvastatin to atorvastatin ( 48% ; 9,104/18,839 ) , to rosuvastatin ( 35% ; 6,644/18,839 ) , or to pravastatin ( 9% ; 1,603/18,839 ) . for example , 21% versus 11% had chronic ischemic heart disease and 11% versus 8% had a previous myocardial infarction . in contrast , the prevalence of other important comorbidities ( eg , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) was similar to that in nonswitchers . the sex and age distributions among statin switchers and nonswitchers were similar ( 51% males among nonswitchers and 48% among switchers ; 40% aged over 65 years among nonswitchers and 39% among switchers ) . the mpr for the nonswitchers was 0.93 ( iqr 0.781.0 ) , while the mpr for the patients who switched statin type was 0.90 ( iqr 0.751.0 ) preswitch and 0.93 ( iqr 0.701.0 ) postswitch . among the statin initiators , 26,314 persons ( 16% ) completely stopped their statin treatment : ie , were nonpersistent . compared with all patients who started statins , nonpersistent patients were more likely to be very young ( aged < 45 years ) or very old ( aged > 75 years ) , more likely to live in small municipalities in rural areas , more likely to be divorced , and importantly  had a slightly higher prevalence of almost all examined diagnoses of comorbidity , including cardiovascular disease ( data not shown ) . among the 133,856 patients with at least one cholesterol measurement recorded prior to their first statin prescription , the most recent cholesterol measurement was , on average , 9 days ( quartiles 528 days ) before redemption of a statin prescription . furthermore , 123,743 patients had at least one cholesterol surveillance measurement ( median 80 days ) after starting to use statins . the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with and without cholesterol measurements recorded in the database were very similar , except that more patients without measurement lived in large cities ( 29% vs 8% ) , and more patients without measurement ( 49% vs 38% ) started statin treatment early in the period ( 200406 ) , when the laboratory database may have been less complete . median total cholesterol in new statin users decreased from 6.3 ( quartiles 5.57.0 ) mmol / l at the most recent measurement before statin initiation to 4.5 ( quartiles 3.95.1 ) mmol / l at the first measurement after initiation , and remained remarkably stable thereafter ( figure 2a ) , corresponding to a reduction of 28% . median ldl cholesterol decreased rapidly from 4.0 ( quartiles 3.34.6 ) mmol / l to 2.3 ( quartiles 1.92.8 ) mmol / l , corresponding to a reduction of 43% . median hdl cholesterol remained stable at 1.4 mmol / l before and after statin initiation . among patients who later switched statin type , there was a smaller initial decrease in cholesterol values compared with nonswitchers , and some increase in cholesterol levels after the first surveillance measurement ( figure 2b ) . among patients who switched statin type , we observed a modest reduction in cholesterol level after their switch ( figure 2c ) . table 3 shows attainment of target cholesterol levels by risk group . among all statin users , 66% of patients in the very high - risk group reached their target value for total cholesterol , while corresponding figures were 74% and 80% for patients in the high - risk and low- to moderate - risk groups , respectively . when stratified by switching of statin type ( yes / no ) , results for statin nonswitchers were comparable with the overall results . among patients who switched statin type , the percentages attaining target cholesterol levels after the first switch and before the second were 46% , 56% , and 64% for the three risk groups , respectively . when focusing on target attainment at the very first measurement after statin initiation ( averaging 3 months after statin start ) , 43% in the very high - risk , 49% in the high - risk , and 55% in the low- to moderate - risk groups reached total cholesterol target . our population - based data show that the rate of new statin use in northern denmark seemed to reach a plateau and begin to decline starting in 2008 , and the initiators were adherent in their use . the reduction in median total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol was similar to that observed in clinical trials . following european guideline lipid goals , 66% in the very high - risk group reached target levels for overall cholesterol and 54% for ldl cholesterol . corresponding percentages were about 80% among the high - risk and low- to moderate - risk groups . previous reports have shown a large increase in population - wide statin use in the 2000s . raymond et al21 reported a 1.7-fold increase in incident statin use based on prescription drug claims in british colombia during 19992004 . our finding that new statin use levelled off starting in the late 2000s may be due to statin treatment saturation within a large pool of previously untreated individuals , or possibly more restrictive use after reports of potential adverse long - term effects of statins . as expected , many patients initiated on statins had previous hospital - based diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases and other comorbidities . the higher proportions of documented cardiovascular disease among patients initiated on the more potent statins may be related to guidelines recommending their use in patients with acute cardiovascular disease.19 furthermore , the increase in starting doses of statins during the observation period is also in accordance with newer treatment guidelines;22 further examination of the impact on the changed starting doses over time is warranted , as dose is related to efficacy in lowering cholesterol.11 we chose to examine attainment of cholesterol levels overall for the statins , since almost all new users start with simvastatin in denmark , in accordance with danish guidelines . our finding that attainment of target cholesterol levels differs among patient risk groups is in line with previous real - world findings from the netherlands.8 additionally , the cholesterol target level attainment in this routine clinical care setting was similar to findings from randomized controlled trials.11 while danish and european guidelines contain lipid goals stratified on risk,17,18 the newest us guidelines have removed the use of lipid goals , and suggestions have been voiced that they ought to be refined rather than removed.23 given that the main desired outcome of increased statin therapy is a decrease in cardiovascular events , it is interesting to note that the incidence of new myocardial infarction has continously decreased over the past 20 years in denmark , as reported by schmidt et al24 based on population - based data . they only included follow - up until 2008 ; thus , further observation is warranted as to whether the continuing increase in statin use and the plateau from 2008 have been accompanied by a continuing decrease in cardiovascular events in denmark . adherence was high in this study ; both a high medication possession ( mpr ) and high treatment persistence were observed during our study period . whereas others have reported clinically important declines in persistence over time,6 only 16% among our study participants appeared to quit statin use totally . compared with previous studies of statin initiators , our study had the advantage of a rather long follow - up time and allowed for shorter gaps of treatment . the generally high adherence observed in this study is positive news , and further examinations of predictors of adherence are warranted . danish guidelines state that simvastatin should be the first - line drug of choice , and it is apparent from our findings that danish physicians adhere to these guidelines.17 twelve percent of patients initiated on statins switched statin type , most often from simvastatin to a more potent statin . in clinical practice , reasons for switching may include adverse side effects and/or failure to attain target cholesterol levels . accordingly , we observed that patients who later shifted statin type experienced less initial reduction of cholesterol levels . unfortunately , our data did not allow us to determine whether insufficient cholesterol reduction was related to poor drug effectiveness , reduced compliance ( eg , due to side effects ) , or choice of dose with the first statin prescribed , but we know that adherence ( expressed as mpr ) is comparable . patients who later shifted statin type also had substantially more heart disease than all initiators , which may explain this group s greater difficulty in reaching their cholesterol targets . strengths of this study include its large size , population - based design , and access to high - quality danish medical databases providing a complete hospital contact , prescription , and laboratory history . our findings are based on data from a wide range of unselected patients in the community and may be transferrable to other population - based settings . some statin - treated patients apparently did not present for surveillance measurements , some may have emigrated outside our data catchment area , some died , and some started statins late in the study period and were followed for only a short time . the patients without cholesterol measurement did not differ in demographic or clinical characteristics compared with the patients with cholesterol measurements . we focused on new statin users from 2004 onward , and patients who had already received statins before the start of the study were left - truncated . this may have excluded from our study early statin users in the background population with a strong medical indication for statins , and subjects who had earlier started and then entirely discontinued statins due to adverse events or lack of effect . on the other hand , having a short look - back period of only 15 months before 2004 may have artificially inflated new statin user rates in the earliest study years because of the inclusion of some previous statin users who restarted statin use during the first study years . in addition , filling a statin prescription is only a proxy for statin utilization . however , the calculated medication possession ratio in our patients was close to 1 , suggesting a surprisingly high adherence to the medication in our region . furthermore , diagnoses made in the primary care setting by patients general practitioners were not included in our data , and our estimates of comorbidity prevalence are likely to be underestimates , as can be identified by the discrepancy between diseases and marker drugs . another concern is that lifestyle changes such as a healthier diet and increased physical exercise are the recommended first interventions to decrease high lipid levels . unfortunately , we had no information on such and other ( eg , smoking cessation ) behavioral changes . finally , our patient risk group classification had to be modified according to data availability . in particular , we lacked data on individual risk factors necessary to evaluate the indication for statin treatment in the low- to moderate - risk group . in conclusion , our population - based data from routine clinical care show that statin use is very prevalent in northern denmark . cholesterol level target attainment in the community setting is similar to findings from clinical trials ; however , a substantial proportion of patients , particularly those at high risk , did not reach target cholesterol levels .","purposeto examine the annual rate and cumulative prevalence of statin use in denmark 200410 , including adherence of use and attainment of cholesterol targets.methodswe included all individuals aged 1886 years with a first statin prescription in northern denmark in 200410 . 
 we calculated the annual rate and cumulative prevalence of statin use . 
 we examined cholesterol values before and after start of statins and the proportion reaching targets according to european guidelines and cardiovascular risk group.resultsthe study population consisted of 161,646 new statin users ( 51% men ; median age 62 years ) . 
 the peak rate of new statin initiators occurred in 2008 , and a cumulative prevalence of 94 users per 1,000 population was reached in 2010 . in total , 98% of new users started with simvastatin . 
 eighty - eight percent ( 142,897 ) did not switch statin type during follow - up . 
 overall persistence was 84% . 
 the reduction in median total cholesterol in new statin users was 28% ( from 6.3 
 mmol / l to 4.5 
 mmol / l ) , while it was 43% ( from 4.0 
 mmol / l to 2.3 
 mmol / l ) for low - density lipoprotein cholesterol . among patients with very high cardiovascular risk , 
 66% attained the recommended total cholesterol target ; corresponding figures were 74% among high - risk patients and 80% among low- to moderate - risk patients . 
 corresponding figures for low - density lipoprotein cholesterol were 54% , 82% , and 88% , respectively.conclusionsstatin use has become very prevalent in danish adults , with high adherence . 
 cholesterol reduction after statin initiation is similar to that found in clinical trials , yet a substantial proportion of patients does not reach target cholesterol levels .",392
"women have among the highest rates of new hiv infections globally and the rate of new infections has not lessened in recent years [ 14 ] . african americans account for 66% of new hiv infections among all us women over 5 times their proportion representation ( 12% ) in the population . one in 30 african - american women can expect to acquire hiv infection during their lifetime ; the vast majority of these are through heterosexual intercourse . crack - using african - american women are a distinct , hard - to - reach population for whom empowerment to reduce hiv / sti risk takes on additional complexities due to the entangled dependencies of drugs , partnerships with men ( who are often drug involved ) for material support for women and their children , and constant threat of violent reprisal [ 4 , 79 ] . concurrent infection with sti is considered to be endemic among african - american , drug - using , hiv+ women . women 's biological inequality in vulnerability to sexually transmitted infection ( sti ) can be addressed with greater availability and use of male and female condoms ( fc ) . in addition to challenges in the diffusion of available protection technologies , however , gender inequity in sexual relationships , limited bargaining power of women complicated by threats of violence , and insufficient resource commitment to health issues among minorities and the poor all contribute to women 's continuing entrenchment of hiv / aids in the united states . the fc is the only female - initiated protection method that protects against hiv / sti and unwanted pregnancy at a level equivalent to a male condom ( mc ; ) . full integration of the fc has lagged far behind in hiv prevention efforts [ 1214 ] . interventions for us populations at high risk   infrequently ( 4 of 14 studies ) included information and counseling on the fc , although most studies were targeted to heterosexual risk groups . formal cdc documents on voluntary counseling and testing ( vct ) do not specifically refer to fc as integral to the counseling approach . effective interventions targeted to drug - using women to reduce sexual risk are few in number and , as pointed out by wechsberg et al . , have rarely involved follow - up intervals of longer than 6 months . studies with short - term followup evaluating effective intervention approaches have included two woman - focused interventions : the co - op model   as well as the nida standard model tested by sterk and colleagues , as against two enhanced models . the womens ' co - op intervention is a brief 4-session intervention with mixed individual and group sessions , based on empowerment and feminist theory , encouraging women to understand their hiv risks in the context of substance abuse and effects on personal power and vulnerability to victimization . numerous adaptations have been conducted since the first trial of the intervention , which resulted in its recognition as a best evidence intervention , based on results from 6-month followup . long - term followup ( 4 years ) of 60% of the original study population , however , found evidence of differential attrition favoring the retention of the high - risk participants and lack of long - term sustained salutary effects observed at 6 months . sterk and colleagues   followed 333 mainly crack - using women who were randomly assigned to three different conditions . with 96% retention at 6 months , positive change was demonstrated in drug use behavior and sexual risk behavior , as well as drug - related sexual risk behavior such as sex trade . however , no differences among the nida standard and woman - focused interventions were found . the enhanced interventions were based on five behavioral theories with a gender- and culture - specific focus . all conditions involved access to prevention methods and included practice of negotiation and protection techniques and technologies . the behavioral intervention tested here (  bestbet  ) integrated elements from three existing theories  the theory of gender and power , community empowerment theory , and risk reduction / harm reduction theory  as well as an original theory of  body empowerment . the latter draws heavily from feminist health principles espoused widely in the 1970s in such works as our bodies , ourselves . the bestbet intervention was initially developed as a multiple session , clinic - based intervention among hiv+ women , and has evolved through a series of studies on diverse populations of high - risk women [ 2325 ] . increased body knowledge appeared to facilitate use of women 's barrier methods in these studies because risk behavior declined . we believed that active crack / polydrug users would attend a relatively long , multisession intervention with women - focused content despite the inherent physical and mental challenges involved . we posited that the woman - specific intervention themes would have cross - cutting relevance and produce positive behavioral change among this population at very high sexual risk for hiv / sti .   in this paper , we describe a randomized controlled trial of an intervention (  bestbet  ) from a sample of 198 drug - using women with high - risk sexual behavior who were followed for 12 months . the feminist health model as applied to hiv underscores the need for holistic education about reproductive organs and genitals , rather than a narrow focus on hiv . our intervention included session content on normal female anatomy , the menstrual cycle , pregnancy , menopause , sti signs and symptoms , female cancers , benefits of screening ( mammography and pap smear ) , and common surgeries . the body empowerment approach posits that increased knowledge , sense of ownership , and pride in the body (  body knowledge  ) are an independent pathway to self - esteem and to self - efficacy for protection behavior  use of female - initiated barriers , mc negotiation with partners , and refusal of unsafe sex . thus , we introduced to intervention women the entire range of female methods thought possibly to reduce risk of sti / hiv  female condom , diaphragm , cervical cap , and spermicides ( the study was initiated prior to the findings concerning vaginal irritation with nonoxynol-9 ; we counseled women to abandon use of spermicides for disease protection following publication of the findings)arranged  hierarchically  according to what was known about protection level   in a harm reduction approach to increasing protection behavior ( i.e. ,  something is better than nothing  ) . we also focused on the need for female solidarity and mutual support . these four pillars body knowledge , access to female initiated methods , emphasis on harm reduction , and a setting promoting female solidarity  provided the intervention core components . we integrated content on female and male barriers in each intervention session , focusing on practical applications of the fc with diverse partners , including paid sexual transactions ( e.g. ,  cheeking  or oral application of mc without partner initiation ) concomitant with drug use ( e.g. , inserting an fc before getting high ) , and situations of potentially violent partners ( inserting cervical barrier with spermicide for discreet risk reduction ) . women tried the female barriers at home and shared their experiences at the following group session , where troubleshooting for problems encountered in the initial adoption period was facilitated by a trained counselor . the impact of basic body education coupled with access to a full range of female barrier options on decreasing sexual risk behavior has not , to our knowledge , been evaluated in active substance users . for this trial , we enhanced certain elements and adapted the study to target out - of - treatment drug users . we added a session dedicated to intimate partner violence ( for paying , nonprimary , and primary partners ) including a module on basic self - defense techniques and exit strategies and use of protection methods in the context of forced sex . the intervention was held at a university - operated , community storefront site with a long history of provision of hiv counseling and testing in a poor , inner city neighborhood . the elements of the intervention were ( 1 ) small groups with interactive counseling ; ( 2 ) trained and certified near - peer community counselors with a history of substance abuse and in recovery for at least 2 years ; ( 3 ) role play and rehearsal , ( 4 ) multimedia educational approaches , such as videos , audio tapes , brochures , posters , and anatomical models ; ( 5 ) active referrals to local service organizations ; ( 6 ) access to hiv testing ; and ( 7 ) training of cbo staff for community capacity building . audio tapes of diverse risk vignettes based on interviews with the target population and accompanying illustrated handouts were prepared by an outside nonprofit health organization . we collaborated with a nearby branch of a national family planning organization to facilitate diaphragm and cervical cap fittings and offered patient advocate support to accompany study participants to clinic appointments . to be eligible for the bestbet study , we required women to ( 1 ) be 18 years of age or older , ( 2 ) be hiv seronegative , ( 3 ) report 30% or more unprotected vaginal or anal sex acts over the preceding three months ( averaged over all partners ) , ( 4 ) report not currently being in drug user treatment other than with methadone , and ( 5 ) report that heroin or cocaine were either injected , snorted , or smoked at least 12 times during the same three - month interval . women were excluded for psychiatric problems or if they had been in drug treatment for more than 6 months . because changing drug use behavior was not an explicit study objective , we did not exclude women from attending sessions if they were  high  except if such use disrupted group dynamics . eligible women were recruited in philadelphia between november 2001 and august 2003 , with the use of a mobile outreach van staffed with trained interviewers and harm reduction counselors . the van was parked in designated , high - risk areas known for crack - selling and smoking activity . interested women gave the first written consent to be administered a 20-minute , confidential prescreening assessment interview that included demographic and behavioral risk items as well as to provide locator information . the second screening assessment was conducted at a community storefront site that served as an information and referral center for drug users . recruitment and study methods have , in part , been presented in a prior publication . this study was approved by and conducted in compliance with the institutional review board of the university of pennsylvania . participants completed a baseline risk assessment instrument delivered via audio , computer - assisted self - interview ( a - casi ) targeting sexual and drug user behavior over prior 6 months . additional baseline data were collected in a face - to - face interview including the following : demographic and reproductive health history , history of sti , health care insurance , and types and location of health care services used in past 6 months . following baseline data collection , all women received enhanced hiv and sti harm - reduction counseling that exceeds standard guidelines for hiv voluntary counseling and testing ( vct ) ; both the mc and fc were taught . we counseled women with sti on treatment locations and required these women to bring written confirmation of treatment for formal enrollment . we provided hiv - positive women with referrals for further counseling and care but they were excluded from this study . women randomized to the intervention arm were invited back for five , 3-hour , weekly group sessions within 2 months of enrollment and were contacted for 6- and 12-month reunion sessions at community sites . control participants received limited case management and the offer of free mcs and fcs , but no other proactive study intervention . at 6- and 12-month following enrollment , all assessments were repeated at the community sites or other locations when necessary . masters ' level interviewers were trained and certified in vct and in standardized interviewing techniques . intensive retention efforts ( phone , mailed correspondence , and in person ) were used to follow participants considering their mobility , including community outreach , visits to known crack houses and other hang - outs , and hospital and prison outreach . retention challenges were discussed weekly in study meetings . using multiple methods and extensive efforts to locate hard - to - reach participants , the retention rate was 95% at 12 months . to test for differences between the control and intervention groups at baseline , chi - square for dichotomous variables and independent sample t - test for continuous variables were conducted for demographic variables and background characteristics . univariate analyses including frequencies and percentages were completed to describe the total sample and its subsets at baseline and 12-month follow - up . our main outcome variable , frequency of unprotected vaginal intercourse ( monthly ) , is the focus of this paper . data for this analysis were derived from a series of questions delivered via a - casi , asking first , the total frequency of acts during the interval ( vaginal , anal , and oral ) followed by the frequency of acts protected by mc or fc , diaphragm , cervical cap , or spermicide ( these latter three related only to vaginal sex ) . the remainder was defined as unprotected vaginal sex acts . protected and unprotected vaginal sexual acts were calculated at baseline and at 12-month followup for two types of partners : primary partners and hiv - negative nonprimary partners . the number of hiv - positive nonprimary partners was prohibitively small to include for analysis . a primary ( male ) partner was described as  someone you have lived with or have seen a lot , and to whom you have felt a special emotional commitment . if a woman answered that she did not have vaginal sex in the prior interval ( this was only possible at followup ) or did not have that type of partner , she was considered as having zero frequency of unprotected acts . for this study we used an intent - to - treat analysis with the inclusion of women who may not have been sexually active during followup and/or may not have had a primary or nonprimary sexual partner . pairwise analysis was performed on the outcome variable separately for primary and nonprimary partners from baseline to followup , for each intervention arm , which included generating a paired sampled t - test ( p < 0.05 was considered significant ) . for comparison of intervention versus control arms , first a  change either parametric ( student 's t - test ) or nonparametric tests ( mann - whitney u test ) were used to assess statistical significance , depending on the normality of distribution . all analyses were conducted using spss version 19.0 ( spss , inc . , chicago , illinois ) . a total of 1134 women were prescreened at the van . of the 616 eligible women , 304 ( 49% ) successfully completed the baseline interviews and specimen collection and were invited to participate in the bestbet study . among eligible women completing baseline interviews ( n = 304 ) , of these women , 227 ( 75% ) returned for enrollment procedures and were randomized ( 113 as intervention subjects and 114 as controls ) . twenty - nine women were later excluded based on contradictory information related to eligibility criteria ( see figure 1 ) . a slightly greater percentage of eligible women who completed baseline interviews , as compared to the final study group , reported drug injection ( 49% versus 42% ) and somewhat fewer had health insurance ( 65% versus 70% ) . the majority of the study participants were african - american ( see table 1 ) . a majority of participants were unemployed with nearly two - thirds reporting use of food stamps . most women had a history of drug treatment , with crack / rock cocaine and marijuana as the drugs of choice . most participants ( c 79.8% , i 85.9% ) had a primary male sex partner , and more than half ( c 56.6% , i 60.6% ) had both a recent nonprimary male sex partner(s ) and a primary partner . women with primary partners reported substantial levels of recent ( past 6 months ) intimate partner violence : 21% had partners who had made threats on their life , 34% had been forced to have vaginal or anal sex without a condom , 25% had been punched or hit with something that hurt , and 11% had consulted medical care because of a fight ( data not shown ) . no significant differences across arms were found . at baseline , the overall mean frequency of unprotected vaginal sex acts ( all enrolled women ) with primary partners in the past 6 months was 34.3 ( median = 12 ) , and with nonprimary , hiv - negative partners was 22.7 acts ( median 0 ) . at 12-month followup , the overall mean frequency of unprotected vaginal sex acts ( all enrolled women ) with primary partners was 15 . 6 ( median 0 ) ; with nonprimary hiv - negative partners the follow - up mean frequency was 2.9 acts ( median 0 ) . a total of 189 women completed assessments at 12-month followup ( retention rate : 95.4% ) . for the paired baseline - to - followup comparisons , among controls , for primary partner , baseline frequency was 32.7 acts ; at 12 months this was reduced to 19.3 acts ( paired t - test , p = 0.008 ; see table 2 ) . among intervention women , mean of unprotected vaginal acts at baseline for primary partner was 35.9 and at follow - up was 12.3 ( paired t - test , p = 0.000 ) . for control women with nonprimary hiv partners , mean baseline frequency of unprotected vaginal acts was 21.6 acts ; at 12-month followup frequency was 2.5 ( paired t - test , p = 0.000 ) . among intervention women , frequency of unprotected vaginal acts with non- primary hiv - partners at baseline was 23.8 , and at 12-month followup was 3.5 ( paired t - test , p = 0.002 ) . a statistical test of the change over time ( i.e. , reduction in unprotected acts ) , per partner type , compared across arms , indicated borderline significance for primary partners ( p = 0.075 ) , favoring the intervention arm . for nonprimary partners , no statistical difference could be detected between the change observed across the two arms from baseline to followup ( p = 0.80 ) . proportions of women reporting mc use were greater in both arms in cross - sectional analyses comparing baseline to followup . mc use with primary partners was lower than with nonprimary partners across both arms , at both baseline and followup ( table 3 ) . intervention women reported mc use with primary partners more frequently at followup but the difference across arms was not statistically significant for either primary or nonprimary partners . mc use with nonprimary partner was reported by two - thirds ( i ) and three - quarters ( c ) of women ; the higher rates in i women at follow - up were achieved despite lower usage at baseline with nonprimary partners ( i versus c ) . use of the fc was also substantially higher at followup than at baseline in both arms . the lowest proportions of women reporting fc use at followup were c women with nonprimary partners ( 7% ) . use of spermicide and cervical barriers was also greater at followup compared with baseline for all women except c women with their nonprimary partners . very few protected acts involved spermicide use alone and only 1 woman reported use of a cervical barrier unaccompanied by either mc or fc use . thus , followup method use as compared with baseline method use appeared to increase the least when considering the subgroup  control women - nonprimary partners . for i women , by contrast , there were consistent and substantial differences when comparing baseline to followup , with both partner types and across all methods . the sample of active , drug - using women in this study demonstrated large changes in risk behavior over 12-month follow - up . frequency of unprotected sex acts dropped significantly for both study arms , across both partner types . the difference in frequency of unprotected sex for both study arms was modified by partner type . for primary partners , statistical significance would likely have been realized with greater numbers due to the large variability in the outcome measure . for nonprimary partners , there was no observed difference across the study arms ; women in both arms reported substantial increases in protection . our findings agree with those of others indicating that use of mc is less frequent with a primary partner than with nonprimary partners ; nevertheless , the results with primary partner for intervention women are encouraging as these partners are often considered to pose a greater risk of sti / hiv transmission to drug - using women . although both types of counseling reduced unprotected acts , the  value - added  impact of the group - based intervention appeared to reside mainly with primary partners . in our study , fc use also increased in both arms , with greater and more uniform increases among i women . in particular , at followup , fewer c women used fc with nonprimary partners , with proportions that were significantly different from i women . we have previously shown that introduction to the fc and other female protection methods promoted mc negotiation and possibly a greater rejection of unprotected sex . these findings taken together suggest that our group - based intervention treatment was superior in encouraging behavior change . prior studies among drug - using women have often suffered from short follow - up periods . study participants who used fc found the method sufficiently practical to use with primary and nonprimary partners . there has been a tendency to discount female barrier methods as impractical and unacceptable though no wide - scale evidence supports this contention and indeed there is evidence to the contrary [ 13 , 14 ] . women have potentially more control over fc ( versus mc ) use but its impact will only be realized with strong promotional programs and quality counseling including outreach activities to men wherever possible   and easy access to continuing supplies , to ensure adoption and maintenance of the behavior . the fc should be a regular component of vct , formalized into easily accessible counseling guidelines and promoted widely . a separate analysis of knowledge changes with this intervention   suggests that a key component of fc adoption is empowerment of women through better knowledge of their bodies . such education should be incorporated routinely into future interventions and programs for drug - using women  including , importantly , woman - focused drug treatment programs , still few in number and often lacking a reproductive health approach . our body empowerment approach and counselor training supplied women with key elements to boost the use of female - initiated methods , including cervical barriers and devices that are important and relevant to drug - using women   but poorly promoted and underresearched as a dual protection method . study participants were selected on the basis of specific criteria drawn up to concentrate a high level of drug - related and sexual risk . they agreed and were expected to attend five , relatively long , intervention sessions and return for follow - up assessments . other drug - using populations with a lower risk profile or less availability for study procedures might have demonstrated different results . nevertheless , we used a - casi , an established technique to increase the validity of reporting of sensitive behavior in numerous populations . additionally , there was high variability in frequency of reported unprotected acts at both time points . these considerations tend to mitigate concerns about reporting bias , though there is no way of eliminating this possibility . comparisons of fc and mc use proportions were cross - sectional due to high levels of changes in partner and sexual activity . drug - using women continue to be at extremely high risk for hiv / sti , with large demonstrated racial disparities , despite successful inroads made for other at - risk populations in the interim , such as non - injection - using men who have sex with men ; additional approaches are still urgently needed . arm , as we designed two alternative counseling approaches that could be used in the field ; thus changes over time can not be attributed to the intervention procedures with complete confidence and may be due in part to the additional time duration spent with counselors . of concern , we may well have underestimated the impact of our intervention as compared to mc counseling only , which is practiced widely . also , our analysis was based on an intention - to - treat approach ; women assigned to the intervention arm did not necessarily complete all five sessions . the sample size may have been too small to detect some changes that were statistically significant  for example , the differences within main partner across intervention and control arms . finally , contamination of the message across study arms was certainly possible , given the relatively small geographic recruitment area and overlapping social networks ; this too would have acted to minimize observed differences across the study arms . the hiv primary prevention landscape is changing , with oral preexposure prophylaxis ( prep ) as well as postexposure prophylaxis ( pep ) now documented to be valuable tools in the prevention mix and potentially applicable to drug - using populations . the potential for reducing sexual risk with vaginal prep for women is still unclear , with conflicting and recently disappointing results regarding the efficacy of vaginal tenofovir [ 37 , 38 ] . a daily , voluntary application of an antiviral vaginal compound may suffer from poor adherence ; long - term intact options may be considerably more effective . as additional topical microbicidal compounds complete testing , including microbicidally impregnated vaginal devices , the counseling on the use of such methods , especially among women at high risk such as idu and nidu women , will become more routine . our results suggest that active drug - using women at high risk of sexually transmitted hiv / sti will partake of such counseling and capitalize on expanded access to these technologies .","background . we tested an original , woman - focused intervention , based on body empowerment , and female - initiated barrier methods , including the female condom ( fc ) and cervical barriers .

 two - thirds were african - american ; most of them used crack , had a primary partner , and reported sex exchange . in paired t - tests from baseline to followup , the frequency of unprotected vaginal sex dropped significantly for i ( primary p < 0.00 , nonprimary p < 0.002 ) and c ( primary p < 0.008 , nonprimary p < 0.000 ) arms with all partners . 
 the difference in change across arms was of borderline significance for primary partner ( p = 0.075 ) ; no difference was seen for nonprimary partner ( p = 0.8 ) . 
 use of male condom and fc increased with both partner types over time , but more consistently among i women . conclusion : the  value - added  impact of the intervention was observed mainly with primary partners . 
 body knowledge with routine fc counseling should be incorporated into interventions for drug - using women .",327
"frequent episodic and chronic childhood tension - type headache ( tth ) is a prevalent and debilitating situation for the child and family . after clarifying the diagnosis in an interdisciplinary setting , because many parents are reluctant to choose preventive medication for their child , patient education is an important aspect of pediatric headache team services . the focus is on empowering the family to incorporate a healthy lifestyle at home and at school to actively prevent the development or triggering of headache . the most basic lifestyle factors that a discussion ( between nurse / physical therapist and parent ) can contribute to are sufficiency of sleep , liquids , food , activity level , and how to handle psychosocial stressors.1 for nonpharmacological behavioral treatments , patient education on relaxation therapy with or without electromyographic or thermal biofeedback has shown , over the last 20 years , substantial evidence in reducing headache frequency in both children and adults.25 passive acupunctural laser therapy has also shown positive effects in a controlled trial on headache frequency.6 andrasik et al7 compared preventive medication with amitriptyline and relaxation therapy for juvenile tth and found clinical improvements from both interventions at 1- and 2-year follow - up . even though these effects are supported by evidence , use in practice is more limited than expected.8 a major limitation is that interventions such as relaxation therapy require approximately up to ten 1-hour sessions in which a trained expert teaches the child with the use of specialized equipment.8 as families are busy and society resources sparse , there is a need for educational approaches that are not only less costly but also more accessible and flexible , which is why internet - based self - help interventions are on the rise;9 other alternatives are warranted . physical training compared to relaxation therapy and acupuncture has been examined in one study for adults with chronic tth.10 within - group differences showed significant positive long - lasting effects for all three treatments . brief daily strength training using elastic bands has also been shown to reduce nonchronic headache frequency in adult office workers with neck shoulder muscle pain.11 physical exercise for children has not yet been examined , although the world health organization published global recommendations on physical activity for health in 2011 specifically for children aged 517.12 in one of our previous studies , we found reduced neck  shoulder muscle strength and aerobic power together with increased pericranial tenderness , especially in the trapezius descendens , to be associated with tth in girls.13 we hypothesized that strengthening the shoulder muscles would result in reduced headache frequency and improvements in the girl s physical capabilities . this study aimed at comparing the outcomes of specific supervised strength training of shoulder muscles with the outcomes of counseling ( defined patient education programs ) for girls with tth . a randomized controlled trial was performed in accordance with the consort 2010 statement14 and guidelines for trials for recurrent headache.15,16 the trial was approved by the national committee on health research ethics for hospitals in the capital region of denmark , and the danish data protection agency . registered by clinicaltrials.gov h-3 - 2009 - 081 , identifier ncto115557 . from may 1 , 2010 to september 1 , 2013 , 49 consecutive girls aged 918 years agreed to participate in the study with a 24-months follow - up period until september 2015 . they were diagnosed exclusively with either frequent episodic tth ( at least ten episodes , $ 1 day but < 15 days per month for at least 3 months ) or chronic tth ( $ 15 days per month on average for > 3 months ) , thus fulfilling the international classification of headache disorders 2nd edition and 3rd edition , beta version.17,18 we were unable to recruit a sufficient number of boys to meet the criteria for statistical analyses . all participants were diagnosed and recruited from the children s headache clinic , glostrup and herlev hospitals , university of copenhagen . before inclusion , the girls with tth underwent a clinical diagnostic and neurological examination that included examination of the spine by the department s neuropediatricians and one specialist physical therapist . the diagnosis was clarified using 1- to 6-month headache reports from a diary similar to that recommended by jensen et al.19 exclusion criteria were set by the neuropediatrician from anamnestic , observational and clinical assessments . exclusion criteria were : migraine headache with more than one episode per month for a period of 6 months ;

 vo2max , as well as headache . the results from this study showed a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in headache frequency and duration due to strength training and interdisciplinary counseling . both groups also seemed to benefit from exercising or body awareness , with a significant and not anticipated reduction in neck extension mvc and neck extension / flexion ratio . the reduction indicates a positive change in muscle balance over the neck . over the 22 weeks , the ratio decreased from 1.9 to 1.7 , pointing toward a possible trend that adjustment of muscle balance precedes strength gains . cervicothoracic neck extension / flexion ratio is reported to be stable over years and between sexes and is reported at a level of 1.71.842,43 in adults . in our case control study , 41 healthy girls had a neck extension / flexion ratio at 1.8 . faigenbaum et al44 underscore that children , due to sedentary lifestyles , may , from a young age , not develop adequate muscle strength and motor performance skills and that a deficit in muscular fitness might affect outcomes of strength training . we have not examined asymptomatic prerequisite motor skills , but based on the results we might hypothesize that the first learning outcome these girls accomplished from training was adjusting muscle balance . the compliance with the moderate strength training program we piloted was good , and we can now conclude that it has a potential to provide important changes in physical capability both in terms of adjusting muscle balance and enhancing shoulder strength and 
 vo2max , leading to headache reduction and health improvements . the exercise volume and intensity versus exercise variation should be considered in order to keep a stable weekly volume . further research is still needed to examine the outcomes that children , boys and girls with tth , gain from different intensities and energy expenditures of exercising . also , the relationship between predicted 
 vo2max and tth in girls needs further research . results from a study with adults with tth by sderberg et al10 showed significant effects on headache frequency from physical training . training comprised ten supervised sessions with strength exercises comprising 335 repetitions of five exercises , with each session commencing with 10 minutes of warm - up on an ergometer bicycle.10 the exercise volume was higher than that used in the present study , and the amount of repetitions would probably not be suitable for children . although the results achieved in muscle strength and aerobic power were minor , counseling also included mutual agreements of how to enhance the girl s level of physical activity . none of the groups showed reductions in pericranial tenderness , suggesting that the girl s myofascial pain sensibility did not alter over a period of 6 months . the significant worsening of pericranial tenderness was not anticipated and is interpreted as being due to a rather large coefficient of variation,33 which needs to be further studied . as enhanced pericranial tenderness is seen as a consequence of frequent or chronic tth,45 the lack of reduction in tenderness might indicate that expectations of recovery from a chronic headache situation have a prolonged perspective . dropouts were explained by a perceived lack of either time and/or motivation . to limit the number of sessions and at the same time reach the child s motivation to choose active coping strategies , innovative learning strategies should be considered . digital learning and support combined with social events for the child and family might support an interactive learning situation . physical therapists can work to find new ways of encouraging the child to do physical exercise with , and not despite , electronic devices to counteract a sedentary lifestyle . this study did not examine knowledge improvements or motivation for change / barriers for change at an individual level . baker et al46 recommended identifying barriers for change in interventions at both an organizational and individual level , although evidence of the effect of identifying barriers is not yet clear . consequently , more research is needed that examines the needs of contemporary families and that explores the barriers parents and children face in order to reinvent social and interactive physical behaviors that benefit the child s health and well - being . the 1989 un convention on the rights of the child states that  the best interests of children must be the primary concern in making decisions that may affect them  . this was our main concern when setting up the study and meant that we did not establish a control group without treatment or a placebo treatment . we dealt with interventions as defined by the complexity of involving a variety of health -

type headache ( tth ) is a prevalent and debilitating condition for the child and family . 
 low - cost nonpharmacological treatments are usually the first choice of professionals and parents . 
 this study examined the outcomes of specific strength training for girls with tth.methodsforty-nine girls aged 918 years with tth were randomized to patient education programs with 10 weeks of strength training and compared with those who were counseled by a nurse and physical therapist . 
 primary outcomes were headache frequency , intensity , and duration ; secondary outcomes were neck  shoulder muscle strength , aerobic power , and pericranial tenderness , measured at baseline , after 10 weeks intervention , and at 12 weeks follow - up . 
 health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) questionnaires were assessed at baseline and after 24 months.resultsfor both groups , headache frequency decreased significantly , p=0.001 , as did duration , p=0.022 , with no significant between - group differences . 
 the odds of having headache on a random day decreased over the 22 weeks by 0.65 ( 0.500.84 ) ( odds ratio [ 95% confidence interval ] ) .

"chest physiotherapy is routinely employed as a prophylactic measure prior to major surgery and postoperatively to prevent respiratory complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia.1 at present , only limited evidence is available for some of the physiotherapeutic techniques used in patients with copd.2,3 physiotherapy treatment enhances sputum evacuation4 and can be applied as a single technique but usually a combination of techniques is applied to patients with copd . intrapulmonary percussive ventilation ( ipv ) is a ventilatory technique that uses a device to deliver small bursts of high - flow air into the lungs at high rates , superimposed upon the spontaneous breathing pattern . this causes airway pressures to oscillate between 5 and 35 cm h2o and the airway walls to vibrate in synchrony with these oscillations . a unique sliding venturi , called a phasitron , which is powered by compressed gas at 0.6 to 6 bar , generates these oscillations in the range of 80 to 650 cycles per minute.5 although several studies have addressed the physiological effects of ipv when used in copd patients , there is need for confirmation of its clinical effectiveness . previously , the effects of ipv in copd patients were assessed using lung function parameters , arterial blood gases , and duration of hospitalization . recently developed assessment techniques may give new insights into the effectiveness of airway clearance techniques . one promising new technique is computational fluid dynamics applied to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) images made by ct scanning ; this technique allows evaluation of flow and resistance of separate parts of the lung.6,7 in the present study , this novel imaging was used , in addition to more conventional outcome parameters , to visualize the effects of a single ipv treatment in copd patients . five moderate to severe copd patients ( three females and two males ) with global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease stages 3 to 4 , who were hospitalized for an acute exacerbation , were included in this study . tests were performed before and after ipv treatment in a specific order to minimize the influence on other tests . for pre - treatment tests , the sequence was set as follows : forced oscillation technique ( fot ) in upright sitting and supine positions , conventional lung function measurements ( including spirometry and body plethysmography measurements ) , in- and expiratory muscle strength , diffusion capacity , arterial blood gases sampling , and finally a 3d low - dose ct scan was taken within 1 hour prior to the ipv treatment . patients were asked to score their dyspnea on a borg dyspnea scale before and after the treatment . no significant changes were evident in the spirometric or body plethysmographic indices due to ipv treatment . respiratory muscle strength after a single session tended to decrease , but the changes in inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength were not significantly different . we observed a small but nonsignificant change in the dlco / va ( diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide ) : corrected for alveolar volume ratio ( p = 0.066 ) . four out of five patients coughed up one or more flumes during the ipv treatment . all patients reported that they subjectively felt better after the treatment ( the change in borg dyspnea score , however , was not significant : p = 0.083 ) . arterial saturation tended to increase after a single ipv session but the changes were not statistically significant ( sao2 at baseline and post - ipv treatment : 95%  3% and 96%  1% , respectively ; p = 0.066 ) . 3d airway reconstructions based on the computed tomography ( ct ) images were made for each patient . for example , some peripheral airways that were blocked before the treatment ( possibly due to mucus plugging ) were reopened after the treatment . some airway branches were opened up after ipv and other airways were closed after a single ipv session ( figure 2 ) . the resistance measurements by body plethysmography and fot both showed a tendency toward an increase in airway resistance . the increase , however , was not statistically significant ( p = 0.109 and p = 0.080 alveolar volume for body plethysmography and fot , respectively ) . computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) were used to calculate the local resistances for the different branches in the airways . specific airway resistance , calculated for the local changes in airway resistance , showed changes after the ipv treatment ; however , none of the changes were statistically significant . although the 3d computer models showed no changes in the overall airway resistance , local changes were observed , as indicated in figure 2 . branches with airway blockage in the preintervention scan were reopened in the post scan . in these branches , airway resistance seemed to decrease , possibly due to movement of mucus ; however , this is yet to be confirmed by the use of a control group . table 2 gives an overview of the airway changes observed in the different patients after a single ipv session . although data shown here are not compared with the data of a control group , 3d ct imaging has the potential to evaluate the displacement of mucus plugs and removal of mucus plugs in some copd patients after an ipv treatment . although we saw changes , the use of a control group is needed to confirm our findings . our study focused on the visualization of the short - term effects of a single ipv treatment . we used functional imaging to demonstrate that the airway geometry was changed by the ipv session whereas lung function parameters did not show any significant differences . the sample size in the present study is small ; more patients are needed to verify these findings . the accuracy of ct imaging has been confirmed for the assessment of the bronchodilator response in asthmatic patients8 and for the particle deposition of an aerosol in the lung.9 the usefulness of 3d imaging and cfd processing has also been shown in the assessment of changes in upper airways 10 and small airways.11 for example , cfd can detect changes in airway resistance in patients with asthma.8 one of the main advantages of the cfd method is that this technique allows investigators to make specific models of the patient s airways for use in analyses.12 in our study , we demonstrated that the effect of a single ipv treatment could be evaluated using functional imaging . despite its small sample size , this study demonstrated that local treatment effects could be visualized with 3d imaging of the airways . the resulting models allow a calculation of the change in airway volume and change in airway resistance . the technique can be used for comparison with traditional outcome parameters , which opens up perspectives for evaluation of physiotherapeutic drainage techniques , and may allow standardization and validation of different airway clearance techniques . further research should focus on the relationship between mucus displacement and local changes in airway flow and resistance .","objective : chest physiotherapy enhances sputum evacuation in copd patients . 
 it can be applied as a single technique or as a combination of techniques including intrapulmonary percussive ventilation ( ipv ) . 
 recently developed assessment techniques may provide new insights into the effect of airway clearance techniques.participants:five moderate to severe copd patients ( three females and two males ; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 39.49% predicted ) who were admitted in the hospital for an acute exacerbation were included in this study.methods:a novel imaging technique was used , together with other conventional techniques , to visualize the short - term effects of a single ipv treatment in copd patients.results:no significant changes were noted in the lung function parameters or arterial blood gases measured within 1 hour after the end of the ipv session . computed tomography images detected changes in the airway patency after the ipv treatment compared with before treatment . 
 local resistances , calculated for the three - dimensional models , showed local changes in airway resistance.conclusion:the effects of a single ipv session can be visualized by functional imaging . 
 this functional imaging allows a calculation of changes in local airway resistance and local changes in airway volume in copd patients without affecting conventional lung function parameters .",252
"an esthetically pleasing smile requires gingival health , a proportional amount of gingival display during forced smiling and harmony among the size , shape , position , and color of the teeth . excessive gingival display during smiling has been a case of esthetic embarrassment for many patients . gummy smile is seen due to improper relation between the gingival tissue and the tooth , with gingival tissue in excess and tooth portion in a small amount . at least 50% of the patients exhibits some form of gingival display in a normal smile . however , exaggerated or forced smile patterns display gingiva in up to 76% of all patients . in absolute numbers , a normal gingival display between the inferior border of the upper lip and the gingival margin of the maxillary central incisors during a normal smile is 12 mm . in contrast , an excessive gingiva - to - lip distance of 4 mm or more is classified as  unattractive  by lay people and general dentists . a subset of this patient population exhibits an upper lip that lies far enough above the maxillary gingival zenith that it is described as unattractive . gummy smile may not present with any pathologic difficulties , but definitely affects the patient 's psychosocial behavior . it is the gingiva which dominates the visual feature in gummy smile when compared with teeth and lips giving an unaesthetic appearance . patients having excessive gingival display because of delayed eruption of teeth can be treated by crown lengthening and gingivectomy , but some patients might require further treatment . a careful diagnosis and a proper treatment plan thus are very essential correcting the deformity . diagnoses such as hypermobile upper lip , short upper lip , and/or vertical maxillary excess require surgical corrections . moderate gingival display that is not skeletal in origin and vertical maxillary excess that ranges between 4 and 8 mm can effectively be treated by surgical repositioning of upper lip limiting the retraction muscles such as zygomaticus minor , orbicularis oris , levator anguli oris and levator labi oris . conventional lip repositioning has been described in many case reports recently for the designing the gummy smile ; however , only few have described the modified lip repositioning procedure . this case report describes the surgical technique and outcome of modified lip repositioning in the treatment of excessive gingival display . a 23-year - old male patient reported to the department of periodontology and implantology , vyas dental college and hospital , jodhpur ( india ) , with the chief complaint of excessive display of gums while smiling . there were no significant medical or family history and the patient presented with no medical conditions that could contradict the surgical procedure . on extra oral examination , however , the high lip line was noted during smiling , which presented with a moderate gingival display . intraorally , a moderate gingival display was seen during smiling , which extended from maxillary right first molar to maxillary left first molar . also , there was slight higher pull of the upper lip on the right side near first molar when compared to the left side which gave an unesthetic appearance [ figure 1 ] . measurements such as gingival display , while forced smiling [ figure 2 ] and the upper vermillion lip length were recorded with unc calibrated probe . there was a 6 mm of gingival display on forced smiling and 7 mm of upper vermillion lip length . the preoperative figure showing the gummy smile 7 mm of gingival display as measured by unc-15 probe informed consent was obtained after discussion of the benefits , possible complications , and alternatives to lip repositioning . lip repositioning is a surgical way to correct gummy smile by limiting the retraction of the elevator smile muscles ( e.g. , zygomaticus minor , levator anguli oris , orbicularis oris , and levator labi superioris ) and yet preserve the labial frenum . local anesthesia ( xylocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:80,000 ) was administered at the vestibular mucosa and lip from the maxillary right to left first molar . with the help of a sharp probe , bleeding points were induced at the mucogingival junction , which guided the first incision to be carried out . a partial thickness incision was made at the mucogingival junction from the mesial line angle of the right central incisor to the mesial line angle of the right first molar [ figure 3 ] . a second partial thickness incision that ran parallel to the first incision and 1012 mm apical of the mucogingival junction was made in the labial mucosa . the incisions were connected at the central incisor region without involving the maxillary labial frenum and at the right first molar region creating a quadrilateral outline [ figure 4 ] . the epithelium was then carefully dissected within this outline [ figure 5 ] , leaving the underlying connective tissue exposed [ figure 6 ] . the same procedure was carried out on the left side at the mucogingival junction by making an incision from mesial outline of left central incisor to the mesial outline of left first molar . the next partial thickness incision was the one parallel to the first incision and 1012 mm apical to the mucogingival junction . the second strip of epithelium was then removed by careful dissection [ figure 7 ] . the first partial thickness incision on mucogingival junction from mesial line angle of right central incisor to mesial line angle of right first molar the second partial thickness about 810 mm above the first incision and two vertical incisions to join at both the ends the strip of the epithelium which was removed the partial thickness dissection which was carried out the same procedure was done on the left side leaving the intact frenum the parallel incision lines were approximated with interrupted stabilization sutures ( silk 4/0 ) [ figure 8 ] . patient was discharged with all postsurgical instructions and medications for 5 days which included analgesic ( ketorolac trimethamine 10 mg twice daily for 3 days ) , antibiotic ( amoxicillin 500 mg tds for 5 days ) , along with cold packs extra orally to decrease postsurgical swelling . the 4 - 0 mersilk sutures were placed patient was recalled after 1-week for a follow - up . the patient reported with mild pain and tension at the surgical site during the 1 week after surgery . it was seen later that the suture area healed in the form of a scar , which was not apparent when the patient smiled because it was concealed in the upper lip . patient satisfaction was recorded after 1-week of the procedure on a scale of 10 with score 1 for extremely unsatisfactory to 10 for a highly satisfactory score . patient was highly satisfied with the treatment carried out and rated a score of 9 on a scale of 10 . the gingival display measured after 1-week was < 1 mm with only interdental papilla being seen after forced smiling giving an esthetically pleasing appearance . revaluation was further carried out after 1-month to see the stability of the results obtained . the gingival display noted after 1-month was 1 mm while smiling [ figure 9 ] . after a period of 1-month he did not find any tension or pain while smiling [ figure 10 ] . 1 mm of gingival display on smiling postoperatively after 1-month the postoperative picture after 1-month lip repositioning is a surgical way to correct gummy smile by limiting the retraction of the elevator smile muscles ( e.g. , zygomaticus minor , levator anguli oris , orbicularis oris , and levator labi superioris ) and yet preserve the labial frenum . local anesthesia ( xylocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:80,000 ) was administered at the vestibular mucosa and lip from the maxillary right to left first molar . with the help of a sharp probe , bleeding points were induced at the mucogingival junction , which guided the first incision to be carried out . a partial thickness incision was made at the mucogingival junction from the mesial line angle of the right central incisor to the mesial line angle of the right first molar [ figure 3 ] . a second partial thickness incision that ran parallel to the first incision and 1012 mm apical of the mucogingival junction the incisions were connected at the central incisor region without involving the maxillary labial frenum and at the right first molar region creating a quadrilateral outline [ figure 4 ] . the epithelium was then carefully dissected within this outline [ figure 5 ] , leaving the underlying connective tissue exposed [ figure 6 ] . the same procedure was carried out on the left side at the mucogingival junction by making an incision from mesial outline of left central incisor to the mesial outline of left first molar . the next partial thickness incision was the one parallel to the first incision and 1012 mm apical to the mucogingival junction . the second strip of epithelium was then removed by careful dissection [ figure 7 ] . the first partial thickness incision on mucogingival junction from mesial line angle of right central incisor to mesial line angle of right first molar the second partial thickness about 810 mm above the first incision and two vertical incisions to join at both the ends the strip of the epithelium which was removed the partial thickness dissection which was carried out the same procedure was done on the left side leaving the intact frenum the parallel incision lines were approximated with interrupted stabilization sutures ( silk 4/0 ) [ figure 8 ] . patient was discharged with all postsurgical instructions and medications for 5 days which included analgesic ( ketorolac trimethamine 10 mg twice daily for 3 days ) , antibiotic ( amoxicillin 500 mg tds for 5 days ) , along with cold packs extra orally to decrease postsurgical swelling . the 4 - 0 mersilk sutures were placed patient was recalled after 1-week for a follow - up . the patient reported with mild pain and tension at the surgical site during the 1 week after surgery . it was seen later that the suture area healed in the form of a scar , which was not apparent when the patient smiled because it was concealed in the upper lip . patient satisfaction was recorded after 1-week of the procedure on a scale of 10 with score 1 for extremely unsatisfactory to 10 for a highly satisfactory score . patient was highly satisfied with the treatment carried out and rated a score of 9 on a scale of 10 . the gingival display measured after 1-week was < 1 mm with only interdental papilla being seen after forced smiling giving an esthetically pleasing appearance . revaluation was further carried out after 1-month to see the stability of the results obtained . the gingival display noted after 1-month was 1 mm while smiling [ figure 9 ] . after a period of 1-month he did not find any tension or pain while smiling [ figure 10 ] . 1 mm of gingival display on smiling postoperatively after 1-month the postoperative picture after 1-month this case report describes an innovative surgical procedure to treat the excessive gingival display during smiling . the procedure is different from the conventional lip repositioning surgery which was first reported in the medical literature in 1973 by rubinstein and kostianovsky . litton and fournier described gummy smile correction with lip repositioning surgery , including elevator muscle detachment in cases with a short upper lip . miskinyar , in 1983 , found no relapses for the 27 patients treated with myectomy and partial resection of either one or both of the levator labii superioris muscles bilaterally in lip repositioning surgery . in 2010 , ishida et al . reported a significant reduction in gingival exposure in 14 patients treated with levator labii superioris myotomy , subperiosteal dissection , and frenectomy . the main objective for preserving the maxillary labial frenum is that it prevents the midline being shifted thus guiding for an esthetically pleasing smile and also avoids the morbidity associated with the removal of maxillary labial frenum . the surgical procedure yielded great results by achieving a greater degree of gingival coverage to hide the gummy smile . the chief complaint of a gummy smile was completely resolved by modified lip repositioning surgical procedure . the quality of life was improved as the procedure met the esthetic demands of the patient . the demerits of the surgical procedure would include : ( a ) chance of recurrence of a gummy smile ( b ) decrease in the vestibular depth following surgery . thus considering all the perspectives ,","gummy smile has been an esthetic concern for many patients . 
 this clinical report describes a successful surgical coverage obtained by modified lip repositioning , thus surgically treating the gummy smile . 
 the technique was performed to limit the retraction of elevator muscles ( e.g. , zygomaticus minor , orbicularis oris , leviator anguli oris and levator labi oris . ) the technique is fulfilled by removing two strips of mucosa from maxillary buccal vestibule on both the sides leaving the frenum untouched and creating a partial thickness flap between mucogingival junction and upper lip musculature , and suturing the lip mucosa with mucogingival junction , resulting in a narrow vestibule and restricted muscle pull , thereby reducing gingival display . 
 this technique is different from the conventional surgical lip repositioning as labial frenum is left untouched over here as it helps in maintain litton the midline for lip repositioning and reduces the morbidity associated with it .",202
"science facilities projects require the collaboration of many different parties , and an effective coordination between these individuals leads to successful outcomes . architects with experience in designing laboratories bring expertise and creativity as they provide their clients with a variety of issues and examples to consider as decisions are made about optimal space configurations . the success of the project is dependent upon the effective teamwork between the client , the architects , and the construction management staff . in the design phase of the process , there is a recursive aspect to the exercise , as concepts get refined and translated to actual construction documents . although the campus planning , physical plant and administration ( e.g. , dean of the faculty or financial affairs ) staff are critical representatives of the institution , it is also important to have faculty perspectives heard as they pertain to the evolution of the program for the building . as described below , a  faculty shepherd  is a desirable addition to the team . this person represents the faculty and is charged with maintaining the integrity of the program as the design and construction go forward . the opportunity to provide input into the development of new spaces comes with the responsibility to provide the lab designers with as much information as possible . descriptions of how teaching and research are accomplished , expectations of new equipment or staffing changes , and needs and desires to have shared spaces are all important issues to raise . it is important to balance the vision for new spaces with a flexibility to seriously consider suggestions from the architects , who have the benefit of knowing designs that have worked well at other institutions . for any project , one of the first considerations is how the objectives fit into the campus curricular and strategic plans . at some campuses , there might be a master plan indicating how renovations or expansions of science facilities contribute to the strategic objectives of the institution . in some cases , specific curricular programs are considered important to develop as focal points for the science offerings . in others , increases in science enrollments have occurred or buildings that were effective years ago no longer support modern science , both in terms of the increased demand on technology or laboratories that need to be renovated for safety concerns . one common driving force for renovation of science facilities is that science education has changed over the decades . one of the main changes at many institutions is the incorporation of student research as a focal point in the way in which students learn science , either in laboratory courses or in conducting independent studies . in other cases , the changes in teaching style might not match the spaces that were appropriate for teaching in a different era . for example , in some disciplines , there is less division between laboratory and lecture ; new spaces are constructed to allow for a seamless transition to both types of teaching within the same spaces . extensive faculty discussions are critical in developing an optimal set of perspectives regarding the needs and the priorities of the spaces to be developed . a self - study serves the purpose of identifying where the opportunities and needs lie . the discussions of how to build on strengths and how to deal with weaknesses have the potential to alter the educational environment for years to come . if possible , faculty discussions across departments are helpful , particularly when incorporating the opinions of younger faculty who will benefit the most from the new spaces . benchmarking data can be helpful to the administration and trustees as they decide on the magnitude of a project . in the case where there is a possible these data are particularly relevant to faculty when there are multiple departments involved in the project . departments have different needs , and comparative data provide the information to enable appropriate allocation . once the appropriate determinations of total space have been made , departments might decide to partition the space in different ways . one way to accomplish this successfully is to have a faculty member serve as the  shepherd  of the project . ideally , this person would be involved in all meetings with the administration , architects , and construction professionals to represent the faculty and to be responsible for ensuring that the academic program is maintained as the many decisions occur throughout the duration of the project . as a central figure , this person serves to keep all parties informed of the progress and issues that arise . faculty shepherds become so familiar with the different faculty and departmental needs that they can be critical in keeping important program considerations at the forefront . they provide an effective way for architects to communicate with the faculty and staff , and they assist the deans in dealing with committees and meetings that would otherwise be organized by an administrator from the dean s office or physical plant . particularly in large projects , the constituencies that need to be involved thus , several committees are helpful to have in place , each with a specific charge . for example , a general building committee would bring together a larger number of people to review progress of the design , but a health and safety committee might be responsible for reviewing and revising the policies regarding storage of and access to chemicals . in our project at hamilton , one committee consisted of representatives of the departments or areas included in the project , and this group played a fundamental role in coordinating the deliberations within the different departments regarding their teaching and research spaces . other items require the input from other members of the campus community who will have a significant impact on the operation of the building , including those in the maintenance , registrar , information technology , and food service areas . if there are classrooms that will serve other departments , then conversations should take place with faculty from non - science departments . it is desirable to include students on many of these committees to provide their perspective on the important and desirable features of new spaces . many faculty members are so heavily involved in their own work that they have not had the opportunity to examine the best practices and spaces at other institutions . it is well worth the investment of time and money for them to see the most interesting projects that have been constructed . when the faculty members visit these buildings , they become aware of different approaches and come up with creative ideas of their own . although each project has its own unique features , some general characteristics can be seen in many modern science buildings . one of the trends at small colleges has been to bring several disciplines ( and sometimes all of the sciences ) under one roof . this serves interdisciplinary programs particularly well , but also recognizes the fact that the traditional disciplines have blurred boundaries between each other . these arrangements benefit neuroscience programs in particular , since those students typically take courses in biology , chemistry , and psychology , and the faculty and student research sometimes requires access to equipment that is housed in different departments . modern undergraduate science education is exciting to watch , with students engaging in laboratory work , collaborative activities , and oral presentations with attractive slides ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . buildings are energized when the activity in the classrooms and laboratories is visible to visitors passing through the building . the presence of glass in doors and walls also provides an element of safety by allowing students to be seen from hallways . of course , there are times when visibility is counterproductive to a particular laboratory experiment or demonstration . at hamilton , a few faculty members have covered the glass windows to their laboratories with shades . in the behavioral neuroscience testing rooms , when we are conducting experiments that require privacy , these panels are easily inserted for the times when testing is taking place . at hamilton college , offices are located near laboratories to let faculty members always be in close proximity to the student research . the teaching laboratories are also in the same areas , which makes those spaces available for use for research during summer months when they are not being used for classes . when possible , shared prep rooms and support spaces allow for efficient shared access to equipment and chemical storage . over time , faculty members will change , curricular programs will evolve , new areas of inquiry will develop , and student course selections will differ . over many years , the distribution of faculty might change from discipline to discipline . as part of the design process , it is useful to ask how the configuration of spaces would accommodate an additional faculty member or a faculty member with a different specialty area . one objective might be to include expansion spaces that are shared and thus not designated for any particular department . as needs change and some programs become smaller and other new ones are formed , these spaces can serve different departments at different times . flexibility can also be incorporated into the way individual spaces are arranged . for example , for wet lab bench work , it might be useful to have a shared student - faculty research lab that serves more than one faculty member . in this way , during a semester when one faculty member needs more space and another one less , their use of the area in the laboratory can expand and retract accordingly ( see figure 3 ) . for other situations , all other things being equal , a larger number of small spaces might be more helpful than fewer spaces that are larger in size . some neuroscience teaching laboratories have incorporated both laboratory and seminar areas in the same space , and others have had adjacent rooms configured for wet lab and seminar or computer work , thus making it easy to have students engage in both types of activities in the same class period ( see figures 4 and 5 ) . if built - in benches are not required , then sturdy but moveable tables can be considered . in teaching laboratories , this can make it easy to have different configurations from semester to semester or even from week to week ( see figure 6 ) . for those classes where reconfigurations are frequent , casters might be placed on the legs of the tables . tables with built - in outlets and umbilical cords to connect to floor boxes keep sight lines free . behavioral neuroscience laboratories often require lighting , curtains , and cameras that are sometimes suspended from the laboratory ceilings . they are connected to the steel structure of the building , can be configured to provide power , and have tracks to make the position of equipment easy to adjust ( see figure 7 ) . finally , although the teaching and research areas are the focus of the attention of faculty members , there are other types of spaces that create a successful academic building . when students are asked about the spaces that are the most important for them , they place good study areas at the top of the list ( see figure 8) . similarly , a science center that has a caf and attractive classrooms is used by students and faculty from all disciplines and ensures that the building serves the entire campus . modern undergraduate science education is exciting to watch , with students engaging in laboratory work , collaborative activities , and oral presentations with attractive slides ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . buildings are energized when the activity in the classrooms and laboratories is visible to visitors passing through the building . the presence of glass in doors and walls also provides an element of safety by allowing students to be seen from hallways . of course , there are times when visibility is counterproductive to a particular laboratory experiment or demonstration . at hamilton , a few faculty members have covered the glass windows to their laboratories with shades . in the behavioral neuroscience testing rooms , when we are conducting experiments that require privacy , these panels are easily inserted for the times when testing is taking place . at hamilton college , offices are located near laboratories to let faculty members always be in close proximity to the student research . the teaching laboratories are also in the same areas , which makes those spaces available for use for research during summer months when they are not being used for classes . when possible , shared prep rooms and support spaces allow for efficient shared access to equipment and chemical storage . over time , faculty members will change , curricular programs will evolve , new areas of inquiry will develop , and student course selections will differ . over many years , the distribution of faculty might change from discipline to discipline . as part of the design process , it is useful to ask how the configuration of spaces would accommodate an additional faculty member or a faculty member with a different specialty area . one objective might be to include expansion spaces that are shared and thus not designated for any particular department . as needs change and some programs become smaller and other new ones are formed , these spaces can serve different departments at different times . for example , for wet lab bench work , it might be useful to have a shared student -

term benefits , not only in teaching and research , but also in admissions and in the success of the institutional mission . although the examples and descriptions mentioned above have been in the context of large renovation and expansion projects , there are lessons that can easily be applied to small projects . it is remarkable how providing appropriate furnishings to a room can change the effectiveness of the space . regardless of the magnitude of the projects and their eventual design features , the process is critical . when all parties become involved in the discussions , then they can all contribute constructively in the difficult choices that sometimes have to be made because of budgetary limitations . the increases in the effectiveness of the spaces and in the morale of the users can be impressive .","science facility renovation and expansion projects provide opportunities for faculty members to play a role in working with architects and administrators to produce effective spaces for teaching and research . 
 this article summarizes information regarding the process and design features that have proved beneficial for many recent science facilities projects . 
 although the context focuses on large projects , the general principles pertain to smaller changes in spaces that individual departments might be pursuing .",78
"age , gender , oral hygiene practices , and smoking are among the important risk factors that can affect the initiation , progression , and severity of periodontitis . the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease is found to increase with age . furthermore , lack of oral hygiene encourages plaque formation , which leads to increase in pathogenic bacteria that are associated with severe forms of periodontal disease . since time immemorial , tooth brushing has been considered ideal for maintaining a good oral hygiene . despite the relationship between tooth brushing and periodontal disease being unclear ; the breakthrough came in with rajala et al . reporting the disease to be more prevalent in sporadic toothbrush users than otherwise . additionally , a positive association between tooth brushing and low periodontal disease prevalence has been confirmed in some studies . studies suggest that the smokers are 11 times more likely than non - smokers to harbor the bacteria that cause periodontal disease and are 4 times more likely to have advanced periodontitis . the sebha city is situated in south - western libya with a population of about 1,30,000 and people come from various urban areas surrounding it ; therefore , it has a heterogeneous society with a low level of health education . as per leous periodontal disease is one of the main problems in libya ; bleeding , dental calculus and shallow pockets is prevalent in almost all the young adults . it is also worth while to note that some of the 18-year - old male never clean their teeth with a toothbrush . the periodontal disease data from several countries collected by using cpitn , is stored in the who global oral health data bank . the sebha city belongs to the countries of the regional office for eastern mediterranean ( emro ) . the oral health data for emro countries is available for the ages ; 15 years , 17 years , 15 - 19 years , 16 - 20 years , 35 - 44 years , and 65 - 44 years . usually , epidemiological studies are primarily concentrated on adolescents , adults , and elderly population . unfortunately , no information is available for the young adults ( 18 - 34 years ) . the plausible reason for this lack of information comes from the fact that early studies presented results which suggested little or no periodontal destruction before the age of 30 years . taking into consideration the lack of data about periodontal disease among young adults , the present study has been designed to assess the periodontal status among the young adults of sebha city . the study also assesses the relationship of the risk factors , such as age , gender , oral hygiene practices , and smoking with periodontal disease . a cross - sectional survey was conducted among the young adults aged 18 - 34 years from sebha city , libya . the city was divided into four zones , and one representative area from each zone was selected . al - jadeed , al - mahdia , gurda , and sukkara were the four selected areas . this was carried out to obtain the prevalence of the periodontal disease so as to calculate the sample size for the main study . the pilot study results revealed that the prevalence of periodontal disease was 56% in al - jadeed . the sample size was determined by using the formula n = z pq / d . assuming that the values obtained are z = a point on normal distribution with 95% confidence , p = prevalence of periodontal disease from pilot study , q = 100-p , d = admissible error that is 10% of prevalence . the survey was conducted at the primary health center ( phc ) in the selected areas . the medical officer posted at the phc was responsible for enrolling the participants for the study in the respective areas . young adults who visited the phc for the 1 time and voluntarily wished to participate were recruited for the survey . schedules were prepared such that the examination of the participant took place on one particular day of the week for one phc center . at first , the participant was interviewed to collect information as per the pro - forma [ appendix 1 ] and later underwent a clinical examination . the oral examination was conducted by a single , trained , and calibrated examiner who was assisted by a recording clerk . 10% of the sample was re - examined and a kappa value of 0.8 was obtained . the codes and criteria of the index were as per the who , oral health survey . three indicators of periodontal status ; gingival bleeding , calculus , and pockets were assessed . , 10 index teeth were examined , which were ( 16 , 17 ) , 11 , ( 26 , 27 ) , ( 36 , 37 ) , 31 , and ( 46 , 47 ) . when two index teeth were considered in a sextant , the tooth with the highest score was recorded . for those below 20 years , only 6 index teeth were examined , which were 16 , 11 , 26 , 36 , 31 , and 46 . the overall cpi score of the participant represented the value of the highest recorded code for that individual . during examination , the probe was kept parallel to the long axis of the tooth , the tip was inserted gently into the gingival sulcus or pocket , and the total extent of sulcus or pocket was explored . the codes were : 
 code 0 : teeth are healthycode 1 : bleeding observed , directly or by using a mouth mirror , after probingcode 2 : calculus detected during probing , all the black band on the probe is visiblecode 3 : pocket is 4 - 5 mm ( gingival margin within the black band on the probe)code 4 : pocket is 6 mm or more ( black band on the probe not visible)x : sextant is excluded ( less than 2 teeth present)9 : not recorded . code 0 : teeth are healthy code 1 : bleeding observed , directly or by using a mouth mirror , after probing code 2 : calculus detected during probing , all the black band on the probe is visible code 3 : pocket is 4 - 5 mm ( gingival margin within the black band on the probe ) code 4 : pocket is 6 mm or more ( black band on the probe not visible ) x : sextant is excluded ( less than 2 teeth present ) all the subjects were well - educated and signed the informed consent form . the ethical board , scientific committee of the faculty of dentistry , sebha university , sebha , libya approved the protocol of the study . statistical analysis was carried out with the help of a statistical package for social sciences ( spss version 16 ) . chi - square test and analysis of variance ( anova ) was used to compare between the groups at 5% level of significance . the variables were age , gender , frequency of tooth brushing , and smoking habit that were compared with the cpi codes . out of the determined sample size of 1,256 people , the study population comprised of 1,255 individuals , of which 1,006 ( 80.15% ) were females and 249 ( 19.84% ) were males . the distribution of the sample as per the age and age groups is shown in table 1 . distribution of the study sample according to the age regarding the oral hygiene practices , overall , 1,118 ( 89.08% ) people reported to have used toothbrush and toothpaste for cleaning and 137 ( 10.91% ) people used other aids , such as finger and siwak . only 50 ( 3.98% ) people were current smokers and all were males , of which maximum ( n = 22 ) people smoked 10 - 20 cigarettes / day . overall , the cpi analysis showed that a majority of 44.30% ( n = 556 ) were detected with calculus ( cpi code 2 ) followed by 40.63% ( n = 510 ) with shallow pockets ( cpi code 3 ) , 6.29% ( n = 79 ) with bleeding ( cpi code 1 ) , and 4.06% ( n = 51 ) with deep pockets ( cpi code 4 ) . only 4.7% ( n = 59 ) had healthy periodontium ( cpi code 0 ) . table 2 shows the distribution of people according to the cpi codes in relation to the different variables considered in the study . the frequency of tooth brushing and smoking were not significantly related to the cpi codes . distribution of people according to the community periodontal index cpi codes in relation to the different variables the overall mean cpi score was 2.33 ( 0.84 ) . mean cpi score of the sample for different ages table 3 shows the mean ( sd ) number of sextants as per the cpi codes in relation to age . a maximum of 2.45 sextants were healthy among 18 years old , which further gradually decreased as the age advanced . from 19 years onward mean ( sd ) number of sextants as per the cpi codes in relation to age the literature search for information regarding the oral health status of the population in sebha resulted in the presence of only one pubmed indexed article by hassan and one document that was an assignment report on the oral health situation in socialist people 's libiyan arab jamahiriya submitted to who geneva by leous . the study by hassan among patients attending the dental clinic in sebha , libyan arab jamahiriya , reported that the people here , have poor oral hygiene and low level of education . furthermore , it was found that caries ( 54% ) and periodontal disease ( 41% ) were the main causes for the high frequency of tooth extraction . the report by leous was a pathfinder study conducted on 849 children and 269 adults from 14 sites of the following localities : tripoli , sebha , benghazi , zwara , ajelat , and kaddah . the cpitn index was used to assess the periodontal disease , and its results indicate that the periodontal disease was present from a very young age . very small population in the age group of 20 - 24 years was found to have a healthy periodontium . while drawing a comparison between the population aged 18 years and 20 - 24 years , respective percentage distributions were observed : 3% and 2% had healthy periodontium , 8% and 0% had bleeding , 66% and 69% had calculus , 25% and 27% had shallow pockets , and 0% and 2% had deep pockets . comparing results of the present study with the results reported by leous indicate the percentages of people with cpi code 0 , 1 , 3 , and 4 to be different , while the prevalence of calculus ( code 2 ) was found to be the highest in both the studies . in the who global oral health data bank for periodontal disease using cpitn index , there was no data available for comparison in the age group 18 - 34 years from emro countries . however , for the ages 18 and 19 years , data from countries belonging to regional office for europe ( euro ) , regional office for western pacific ( wpro ) , regional office for africa ( afro ) , and regional office for south east asia ( searo ) was available and was compared with the present study participants of the same age [ figure 2 ] . figure 2 presents a view for all the countries , calculus ( code 2 ) was the highest - recorded cpi score except in south africa where the percentage of healthy periodontium was the highest ( 51% ) . overall , it was observed that the highest prevalence of shallow pockets ( 34% ) was from sebha . overview of periodontal status from different countries it is widely assumed that symptoms of periodontal diseases escalate with age . table 3 clearly indicates that the mean number of sextants for lower codes of 0 ( healthy ) and 1 ( bleeding ) was highest among 18 years old , but as the age increased , the mean number of sextants for higher codes of 2 ( calculus ) and 3 ( shallow pockets ) increased . the presence of shallow pockets , which is an indication of the deterioration of periodontium , was more prevalent in the age group of 25 and above . in the present study , a significant relation was obtained between cpi codes and gender [ table 2 ] . although , there was an unequal distribution of males and females , the individual percentage calculation showed that more females had healthy periodontium , bleeding , and calculus as compared to males . however , the prevalence of shallow and deep pocket was more prevalent in the males . studies indicate that predominantly males , because of their smoking habit , have shown more susceptibility to periodontal diseases . though , the smokers in the present study were all males , significant difference in periodontal status was not observed with smoking . this is a good percentage when compared to other previous studies on libyan and sudanese population , where the percentages were 74.6% and 53% , respectively . currently , many of the world populations in india , pakistan , several african countries , the arab countries , and most of the muslim world still use miswak . the study reported that the sudanese regular miswak users had better oral health and lower levels of oral pathogens than adult sudanese who used a modern toothbrush regularly . however , in the present study , the frequency of tooth brushing was not significantly associated with the cpi codes . within the limits of the study , it can be concluded that only 4.7% young adults in sebha have healthy periodontium . the benefits accuring from the control of periodontal diseases and promoting good periodontal health include , improved quality of life , enhanced general well - being and appearance , reduced halitosis , elimination of bleeding gums , reduced potential threat to longevity of teeth , and improved masticatory function . more importantly , ensuring implementation of preventive procedures amongst young adults could possibly lessen the prevalence of periodontal diseases during their adulthood . this study is probably , the first of its kind to report data on the young adults in sebha and this information can be utilized for planning a preventive model that will include dental health education and preventive procedures .","background : the occurrence of periodontal diseases in humans has been a global problem .

"the mango is a commercial crop in many countries of the southeast asia , namely , india , pakistan , the philippines , indonesia , malaysia , thailand , burma , sri lanka , and bangladesh . mango ranks third among the tropical fruits grown in the world with a total production of 23.87 million tons , to which bangladesh contributed by only 0.64 million tons . it is also gaining rapid popularity in the middle east , south east africa , south africa , florida , israel , and australia . among the fruits , mango ranks first in terms of area and third in terms of production in bangladesh . nutritionally , it contains substantial quantity of appreciable  carotene , vitamin c , and dietary fibre   as well as soluble sugars and different minerals which are used as good sources of nutrition , and readily available and easily assumable in human body , and therefore it is capable to prevent many deficiency diseases [ 7 , 8 ] . approximately 3050% fruits go wasted during postharvest handling , storage , and ripening . among the fruits mango manifested high postharvest losses because of its high perishability and climacteric pattern of respiration . the marketability of this perishable fruit is closely linked with the development of suitable technology which reduces the losses at different stages of harvesting and storage condition . losses in terms of quality and quantity of fruits occur at all stages in the postharvest system from harvesting to consumption . reliable statistical data are inadequate especially in bangladesh to indicate the magnitude of postharvest losses of mango . singh et al .   reported that the postharvest losses of mango fruit in india due to microbial decay ranged from 20 to 33% . quality mangoes are produced in northwestern part of bangladesh , of which about 3538% of postharvest losses are caused due to inefficient handling during its transportation , storage , and marketing . mango always decays after harvest , and postharvest losses can be considerably reduced by applying improved storage technology and prolonging the shelf life of fruits . several researchers used bavistin df ( bdf ) for controlling spoilage of different fruits [ 10 , 11 ] . the efficacy of bavistin against the fruit rot pathogen was reported by several workers [ 12 , 13 ] . although bavistin was observed to be the most effective treatment , there are numerous reports of the negative effects of using chemicals on farm income and the health of farm workers . toxic contamination to the environment , particularly in developing countries , has also been reported . these treatments strongly impede in ethylene synthesis that resulted in low respiration and delay ripening . in addition , fungicidal treatments like bavistin df ( bdf ) are also excellent ethylene inhibitors . these treatments performed effectively in reduction of postharvest decay and extension of shelf life of mango . apparently , these treatments deteriorate the qualities of fruits to some extent , but the reduction of losses and extension of postharvest life of mango will help to increase the market price in the off seasons which play a good role in the economic development . in this present investigation we tried to study the behavioral pattern of physicochemical properties of postharvest mango in the storage conditions . especially the effects of bdf on ph , tritability , and sugar contents were studied in detail . it was also aimed to find out a desirable technology for extension of storage of mango . the two mango varieties , namely , langra and khirshapath , were selected as experimental materials . the mango varieties undertaken for investigation were collected from mango grower of kansart , shibganj upazila of chapainowabgonj district and charghat upazila of rajshahi district , and other material used as postharvest treatments , namely , bavistin df ( bdf ) , were collected from royal scientific store at cooperative market , rajshahi city market . the experiment consisted of two factors and the required numbers of unblemished physically similar , more or less uniform size , shape and color fruits for the experiment were harvested manually from each plant of the varieties , langra and khirshapath . the skin of fruits was cleared with the help of a cloth just after harvesting . the 250 , 500 , and 750  ppm of bdf solution were prepared by dissolving 250 , 500 , and 750  mg of bdf ( commercial product ) in one litre of distilled water . it is noted that the active ingredient of bdf is carbendazim whose initial concentration is 500  g / kg , that is , 50% ( product name the fruits of both varieties were dipped into the bdf solution for a period of 5 minutes . care was taken to ensure enough quantity of bdf being absorbed by the fruits and stored at ambient condition on brown paper . the following reagents were used for determination of titrable acidity : ( i)standard naoh solution ( 0.1  n ) , ( ii)1% methyl red . standard naoh solution ( 0.1  n ) , ten  g of mango pulp was taken in a 100  ml beaker and then it was homogenized with distilled water in a blender . the blended materials were then filtered and transferred to a 100  ml volumetric flask , and the volume was made up to the mark with distilled water . two to three drops of phenolphthalein indicator was added , and then the conical flask was shaken vigorously . it was then filtrated immediately with 0.1  n naoh solutions from a burette till a permanent pink color appeared . percent titratable acidity was calculated by using the following formula : 
 ( 1)%titratable  acidity=(tnv1ev2w1000)100 , 
 where t is the titre , n is the normality of naoh , v1 is the volume made up , e is the equivalent weight of acid , v2 is the volume of extract , and w is the weight of sample . the following reagents were used for determination of total sugar : anthrone reagent : the reagent was prepared by dissolving 2  g of anthrone in one litre of concentrated h2so4,standard glucose solution : a standard solution of glucose was prepared by dissolving 10  mg of glucose in 100  ml of distilled water . anthrone reagent : the reagent was prepared by dissolving 2  g of anthrone in one litre of concentrated h2so4 , standard glucose solution : a standard solution of glucose was prepared by dissolving 10  mg of glucose in 100  ml of distilled water . four  g of mango pulp was cut into small pieces and immediately plunged into boiling ethyl alcohol and was allowed to boil for 5 to 10 minutes ( 5 to 10  ml of alcohol was used per gram of pulp ) . then the extract was filtered through two layers of muslin cloths and the ground tissue was reextracted for three minutes in hot 80% alcohol , using 2 to 3  ml of alcohol per gram of tissue . the volume of the extract was evaporated to about 25% ( 1/4 ) of the volume over a steam bath and cooled . this reduced volume of the extract was transferred to a 100  ml volumetric flask and it was made up to the mark with distilled water . aliquot of 1  ml of pulp extract was pipetted into test tubes and 4  ml of the anthrone reagent was added to each of this solution and mixed well . glass marbles were placed on top of each test tube to prevent loss of water through evaporation . then the tubes were placed in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and then cooled . a reagent blank was prepared by taking 1  ml of water and 4  ml of anthrone reagent in a tube and treated similarly . the absorbance of blue green solution was measured at 680  nm in a colorimeter . a standard curve of glucose was prepared by taking 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 1.0  ml of standard glucose solution in different test tubes containing 0.0 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , and 100  g of glucose , respectively , and the volume was made up to 1  ml with distilled water . then 4  ml of anthrone reagent was added to each test tube and mixed well . the absorbance was measured at 680  nm using the blank containing 1  ml of water and 4  ml of another reagent . the amount of total sugar present in the extract was calculated from the standard curve of glucose . finally , the percentage of total sugar was determined by using the following formula : 
 ( 2)%total  sugar  ( g/100  g  of  mango )  = ( quantity  of  sugar  obtainedweight  of  sample)100 t of acid , v2 = volume of extract , w = weight of sample . reducing sugar content of mango reagent used : ( i ) dinitrosalicylic acid ( dns ) solution : simultaneously , 1.0  g of dns , 200  mg of crystalline phenol , and 50  mg of sodium sulphite were placed in a beaker and mixed with 100  ml of 1% naoh by stirring . when it was needed to store variation between varieties means in connection with titratable acidity was perceived to be highly significant at different days after storage ( table 1 ) . at various days of storage , the langra was noticed to be a higher producer of titratable acidity as compared to the khirshapat . the abating trend was hastil from the initial to 3rd day and , thereafter , it was slower . at initial day , higher ( 3.77% ) was derived from the langra while lower ( 2.47% ) was noticed from the khirshapat . at 12th day , higher ( 0.31% ) was recorded from the langra while , the khirshapat gave lower amount ( 0.24% ) . the results of the present investigation might be possibly due to genetically dissimilarities between two varieties . different doses of bdf solution imposed to this investigation in terms of titratable acidity showed significant variation among the means at various days of storage . at different days of storage , titratable acid content diminished hastily from initial to 3 days , and then it diminished steadily ( figure 1 ) . in all the storage period , higher titratable acidity ( 3.19 , 1.20 , 0.92 , 0.74 , and 0.42% ) was derived from b3 treatment from initial to 12th days followed by 3.09 , 0.68 , 0.40 , 0.22 , and 0.11% from untreated mangoes . these phenomena happening might be possible due to b3 treatment delayed ripening that caused lower diminishing trend of titratable acidity while control treatment caused ripening fast resulting in high decreasing trend of titrable acid content . the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution in relation to titratable acidity of mango pulp demonstrated significant variation at different days after storage except initial days . at different days of storage , there appeared a decreasing trend of titratable acid content with the rising of storage period . at the 6th day , the highest ( 1.00% ) quantity was recorded from the treatment combination of v1b3 and the lowest acid concentration ( 0.30% ) was recorded from the treatment combination of v2b0 ( table is not mentioned here ) . this occurrence might be probably due to the reduction of acid oxidation at v2b3 combination as well as genetic variation in between varieties . the analysis of variance between the varieties exhibited significant variation in terms of pulp ph of mango at different days after storage except at 6th day ( figure 2 ) . at various days of storage , a growing up trend of pulp ph with the increase of storage period was observed . in each storage period , higher pulp ph ( 6.96 ) was noted from the khirshapat at 12th day whereas lower ( 6.85 ) was noted from the langra . the growing up trend of pulp ph was also observed by shahjahan et al . . this phenomenon might be possible due to oxidation of acid during storage resulting in higher ph and also might have been genetical dissimilarities between varieties . different doses of bdf solution subjected to this trial showed significant variation in pulp ph at different days after storage . the results indicated that the growing up trend of pulp ph was perceived from different treated and untreated mangoes at various days of storage ( figure 2 ) . pulp ph was higher in control at all stages of storage followed by the fruits treated with b1 , b2 , and b3 treatments , respectively . the ph value of mango pulp was higher ( 7.05 ) in control which was statistically at par with b1 and b2 treatment whereas the fruits treated with b3 produced lower ( 6.57 ) value at 12th day . the results of the present investigation at b3 treatment interrupted the loss of acid oxidation resulting in lower ph value . the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution imposed to this study in pulp ph were noticed to be nonsignificant at different days after storage . there appeared a slightly rising trend of pulp ph from various treatment combinations at different days of storage . at 6th day , the highest ( 6.90 ) ph value was reported from the treatment combination of v2b0 which was statistically at par with v1b0 and the lowest ( 6.70 ) was reported from the treatment of combination of v1b3 , respectively . statistically highly significant variation was observed in tss content between two varieties at different days after storage . the results exhibited that tss content of mango pulp developed in a continuous stream with the expansion of storage period . the developing trend was hastily from initial to 6th day , thereafter ; it increased slower . from initial to 6th day , the khirshapat enriched a better amount of tss than the langra , but , after 6th day , langra performed better than the khirshapat up to 12th day . at 9th day , higher ( 17.90% ) tss quantity was noted from the khirshapat and lower ( 17.00% ) was noted from the langra ( table 2 ) . absar et al .   reported that tss was increased with maturity of mango fruit . different doses of bdf solution implied to the postharvest mangoes in this study were noticed to be significant in terms of tss content at different days after storage . at different days of storage , the results showed that tss accumulation increased with the increase of storage duration . it also explored that tss content was hastily grown up from untreated mangoes from initial to 6th day and then it came down significantly ( figure 3 ) . the other treatment namely , b1 , also increasingly produced tss from initial to 9th day , and thereafter it decreased sharply . mango fruits treated with b2 also produced more or less similar enhancing trend from initial to 12th days . but the fruits treated with b3 treatment gave very slower motion in tss accumulation at various days after storage . the highest ( 21.25 and 21.30% ) accumulation of tss content was perceived from b0 and b1 treatment at 6 and 9th days while the lowest ( 12.90 and 14.85% ) was noted from b3 treatment ( figure 3 ) . the results of the present studies are strongly supported by the findings of dhemre and waskar   also found the similar results . these happened possibly due to ripening condition resulting in maximizing tss accumulation in control and 750  ppm of bdf solution resisted in ethylene synthesis that caused delay ripening and ultimately in lower tss accumulation . it also revealed that tss accumulation is strongly related to ripening and it caused falling off owing to decaying . the combined effect of varieties and applied different doses of bdf solution in connection with tss content were perceived to be significant at different days after storage except initial and 3rd day . the highest accumulation ( 22.00 , 21.80 , and 21.60% ) was obtained from the treatment combination of v1b0 , v1b1 , and v1b2 at 6 , 9 and 12th days , while the lowest value ( 13.20 , 14.50 , and 17.50% ) was notified from the treatment combination of v2b3 ( table is not presented here ) , respectively . highly significant variation was manifested between both varieties means in terms of total sugar content of mango pulp at different days after storage . this gathering trend was more or less hastil from initial to 9th days in both the varieties ; thereafter ; it expanded slightly slower . at all days of storage , the khirshapat produced more quantity of tsc than the langra . at initial day , the khirshapat had higher ( 6.09% ) while ; the langra provided lower ( 5.57% ) . at 12th day , it gave higher quantity ( 19.64% ) and lower ( 19.07% ) was noted in the langra . reported that total sugar content was expanded gradually , when stored for 6 days at room temperature . the increase in tsc might be possible due to conversion of complex starch or carbohydrate into simple compound . different doses of bdf solution subjected to the investigation in connection with total sugar content of mango pulp demonstrated significant variation at different days after storage except initial day . at different days , the results found that tsc increased hastily with expanding of storage period ( figure 4 ) . the increasing trend was very swift in untreated mango followed by other treatments , namely b1 , b2 and b3 treatment , respectively . the highest quantity of tsc ( 21.06 and 21.36% ) was obtained from control and b1 treated mangoes at 9 and 12th days , while the lowest ( 12.40% and 15.70% ) was reported from b3 treatment . the results of the present investigation are in conformity with the reports of dhemre and waskar . the enhancing trend of total sugar at untreated mangoes might be perhaps due to breaking down of complex carbohydrate into simple compound but b3 treatment made delay ripening at storage period . the combined effect of varieties and implied different doses of bdf solution in this study in terms of total sugar content of mango pulp exhibited nonsignificant variation at different days after storage . the results indicated that total sugar content progressively accumulated with the advance of storage period ( table is not mentioned here ) . at 9th day , the maximum ( 21.31% ) quantity of tsc was formed from the treatment combination of v2b0 while the minimum ( 12.10% ) was formed from the treatment combination of v1b3 , respectively . analysis of variance showed significant effect on reducing sugar content of mango pulp at different days of storage except at 6th day . the results showed an increasing trend of reducing sugar with the progress of storage period . it also annotated that the khirshapat was found better in enriching of reducing sugar than the langra at different days of storage . higher ( 5.47% ) quantity of this sugar was observed from the khirshapat while lower ( 5.20% ) quantity was noticed from the langra at 12th day of storage ( table 3 ) . khirshapat providing more reducing sugar might be possibly due to genetical variation in both varieties . different doses of bdf subjected to this study were perceived to be significant in respect of reducing sugar content of mango pulp at different storage periods except initial day . the results explained that reducing sugar of mango pulp was increased progressively at different days of storage . it also stated that untreated mangoes were better in forming of reducing sugar as compared to other treatments . control was found to be a more effective producer of reducing sugar up to 9th day and then it came down owing to starting decay . at 12th day , the maximum ( 6.27% ) amount of reducing sugar was obtained from b1 treatment and the lowest ( 4.32% ) was obtained at b3 treatment ( table 3 ) . the results of the present study are in inconformity with the findings of dhemre and waskar . lower increasing trend of reducing sugar content treated with b3 treatment might be possibly due to delayed ripening that resulted in lesser conversion of carbohydrates into simple 's molecules . the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution of mango pulp demonstrated nonsignificant variation in terms of reducing sugar content of mango pulp at different days after storage . the results exposited that reducing sugar content grew up progressively at three - day interval up to 9th day ; thereafter , it came down from the treatment combination of v2b0 . at 9th day , the highest ( 6.44% ) quantity was noticed from the treatment combination of v2b0 and the lowest ( 3.90% ) was noticed from v1b3 ( table 4 ) . the variation between the varieties means demonstrated highly significant in respect of nonreducing sugar content at different days after storage . the results were noticed to be an enhanchable trend of nonreducing sugar content at different days of storage . at all the days , it revealed that the khirshapat was observed to be much better than the langra in receiving of nonreducing sugar content ( table 3 ) . at 12th day , higher ( 14.20% ) amount of nonreducing sugar was recorded from the khirshapat and lower ( 13.88% ) amount was recorded from the langra . different doses of bdf solution imposed to this trial were noticed to be a significant variation in connection with nonreducing sugar content of mango pulp at different days after storage except at initial stage . the results stated that nonreducing sugar content of mango pulp was formed progressively at various days . it denoted that untreated fruits were noticed to be better in achieving more quantity of nonreducing sugar followed by the other treatments . this increasing trend was markedly up to 9th day , and thereafter it increased slowly owing to becoming hackneyed . lower rising trend was perceived from the fruit treated with b3 treatment . at 12th day , the highest result ( 15.28% ) was recorded from control and lowest value ( 11.39% ) was recorded from b3 treatment ( table 3 ) . these events might be probably due to b3 treatment retarded ethylene synthesis of mango pulp resulting in delayed ripening and little amount of nonreducing sugar achieving . the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution exhibited nonsignificant in terms of nonreducing sugar content of mango pulp at different days after storage . the results showed a mild growing up trend of nonreducing sugar from different treatment combinations at various days ( table 4 ) . at 9th day , the highest ( 14.87% ) quantity of nonreducing sugar was notified from the treatment combination of v2b0 while the lowest ( 8.42% ) was notified from the treatment combination of v1b3 , respectively . different doses of bdf solution imposed to this investigation in terms of titratable acidity showed significant variation among the means at various days of storage . the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution imposed to this study in pulp ph were noticed to be nonsignificant at different days after storage . a slightly rising trend of pulp ph from various treatment combinations at different days of storage appeared . at different days of storage it also explored that tss content was hastily grown up from untreated mangoes from initial to 6th day , and then it came down significantly . the combined effect of varieties and different doses of bdf solution exhibited nonsignificant in terms of nonreducing sugar content of mango pulp at different days after storage . the results showed a mild growing up trend of nonreducing sugar from different treatment combinations at various days .","a detailed study was carried out with the postharvest mangoes ( namely , the langra and the khirshapat ) treated with different levels of bavistin df ( bdf ) solution ( namely , 250 , 500 , and 750  ppm ) for obtaining results on biochemical changes as well as storability of postharvest mango . 
 the experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replicates . 
 the results of the experiments exhibited that only the single effect of varieties was found to be significant in most of the parameters studied . 
 the langra enriched a greater quantity of titratable acidity and total soluble solid ( tss ) at 3rd day , over the khirshapat . on the other hand , khirshapat showed increased pulp ph and tss at all the storage duration . 
 the results explored that some physicochemical properties , namely , pulp ph , tss , sugar ( total , reducing , and nonreducing ) , and titratable acidity along with shelf life drastically decreased from untreated mangoes .

of great concern is an emerging clinical prevalence of non - albicans candida species ( 11,12 ) . among these , c. tropicalis is common , virulent , and increasingly resistant to antifungal therapy ( 13 ) , c. parapsilosis is particularly problematic , causing severe infections in neonates ( 14 ) , and c. glabrata exhibits a special ability to evade the immune system and survive after cellular engulfment , and can resist antifungal treatment ( 1517 ) . in fungal taxonomy , c. albicans is placed in the order endomycetales , to which the family saccharomycetaceae also belongs ( 18,19 ) , though saccharomyces cerevisiae and c. albicans are separated by 140850 million years of evolution ( 20 ) . despite sharing many similarities , including 3453 pairs of orthologous genes , the two fungi inhabit very different environmental niches , with s. cerevisiae existing as a saprophyte , and c. albicans living in close association with its mammalian hosts . transcriptional rewiring has occurred in their regulatory networks , such that evolved divergence in the activity of orthologous transcription factors , or divergence in cis - regulatory elements , has created distinct regulatory programs in each class ( e.g. galactose metabolism ( 21 ) , mating type ( 22,23 ) and ribosomal proteins ( 24 ) ) . unlike s. cerevisiae , c. albicans exists primarily in a diploid state , with no conventional sexual reproduction that leads to meiosis . instead , c. albicans undergoes a parasexual cycle that involves mating between two diploid cells of the opposite mating type and formation of a tetraploid cell that subsequently returns to diploidy by chromosome loss ( 25 ) . alternatively , chromosome loss may occur prior to mating yielding transient haploids that mate and return to a diploid state ( 26 ) . meiosis has not been observed in either case , and the homologous chromosomes remain mostly intact making the haplotypes much more stable than in other organisms . thus , in order to understand and combat candida pathogenesis , it is important to study candida biology directly , and having access to the phased genome assembly opens up multiple new research opportunities . since its inception in 2004 , cgd has been tasked with maintenance of the primary genome sequence and annotation for the c. albicans reference strain sc5314 . cgd was originally based upon assembly 19 , a diploid , contig - level assembly built from the genomic sequence that had just been completed ( 27 ) , and which included gene models , sequence corrections , and functional annotations provided by a group of volunteer researchers known as the annotation working group ( 28 ) . cgd then took over the task of curating all the candida - related information based on published experimental data , comparative genomics predictions and improved sequence information ( 29 ) . in 2006 , assembly 20 was incorporated into cgd ( 30 ) ; assembly 20 was the first chromosome level assembly for c. albicans , though it consisted of what are referred to as reftigs , wherein each of the chromosomes in the assembly consist of a mosaic of the two haplotypes ( 31 ) . assembly 20 was superseded by assembly 21 , because a sequence from a different strain , wo-1 , had been inadvertently incorporated into assembly 20 . a major update to assembly 21 , based on additional sequence data and comparative analyses ( 32 ) was subsequently also incorporated into cgd . the most recent major update to the sequence is assembly 22 ( 33 ) , which was generated using illumina - based sequencing of sc5314 as well as a collection of congenic strains homozygous for specific chromosomes , which allowed the construction of a phased diploid assembly of the genome . incorporation of assembly 22 into cgd entailed careful reconciliation of sequence ambiguities , potential assembly errors and differences from previous assemblies . we have established a pipeline that takes advantage of all available data , including the illumina - based sequences from muzzey et  al . ( 33 ) , roche 454 sequences generated at cgd , as well as independently published , gene - specific sequence data derived from our curation of the candida literature . we have used this pipeline to correct the sequences for more than 300 features , eliminating many reading frame errors and resolving multiple sequence ambiguities ( table 1 ) . we have also re - analyzed the haplotype assignments for the entire chromosome 3 , which led to an exchange of 845 kb between chromosome 3a and chromosome 3b . improving the reference sequence is an ongoing project and we are currently focusing our efforts on intergenic regions , repetitive sequences and segmental duplications . since 2010 , cgd has used a versioning system to track genome sequence releases , and their associated annotations . the version designation appears in the name of each of the relevant sequence and feature annotation files that are available at cgd , so the exact source of the sequence data is always clear . version designations appear in the following format : sxx - myy - rzz where xx , yy , and zz are zero - padded integers . xx is incremented when there is any change to the underlying genomic ( i.e. , chromosome ) sequence . yy is incremented when there is any change to the coordinates of any feature annotated in the genome ( e.g. any change in location or boundary , or addition or removal of a feature from the annotation ) . yy is reset to  01 when xx is incremented ( when a sequence change is made ) . zz is incremented in response to curatorial changes that affect information that appears in the gff file , specifically gene names , gene aliases , gene ids , gene descriptions , feature types ( e.g. gene or pseudogene ) , and orf classifications or qualifiers ( e.g. verified , uncharacterized , deleted , merged ) . files are checked on a weekly basis , as well as any time that a gff file is regenerated manually , to determine if changes have occurred that warrant a change in the zz number . zz is reset to  01 when either xx or yy is incremented ( when a sequence change is made , or when the coordinates of any feature are updated ) . all versions are archived on the cgd download site . as a hypothetical example , say that we start with s05-m01-r01 as the current version . when the next weekly file check is performed , and the new file is noted to contain curatorial updates to gene names in the database , but no new changes to the structural annotation or to the sequence itself , the new version designation becomes s05-m01-r02 . subsequently , the chromosomal coordinates of a gene are changed , based on curation of a paper that provides evidence for updating the gene model . later , a change to correct a sequencing error is made , and the new version designation becomes s06-m01-r01 . cgd recommends that authors note in their materials and methods sections of published papers what version of the genome they were working with when they performed an analysis , so that the analysis is reproducible . with assembly 22 , it became possible to implement a new position based systematic nomenclature for chromosomal features . the previous systematic names , dating back to assembly 19 , consisted of the  orf19 prefix followed by a unique but somewhat arbitrary number . the new systematic name is based on the known chromosomal location and haplotype , and it consists of the chromosome ( c1-c7 and cr for the eight nuclear chromosomes , cm for the mitochondrial chromosome ) , a unique number indicating the order of features along chromosomes , the strand ( w for watson or c for crick ) and the haplotype ( a or b ) . for example , c4_03570w_a denotes a feature located on chromosome 4 , watson strand and haplotype a. feature numbers start at the left end of the chromosome and increase by 10 to allow for adding new features in the intervening spaces as they are discovered . since systematic identifiers from all the previous assemblies orf19 names , continue to be used by researchers , cgd includes all the previous identifiers as searchable aliases to allow seamless and unambiguous transition between various nomenclature systems . locus summary pages ( lsp ) exist for every chromosomal feature in cgd and provide a primary way to access gene - specific information . in addition to locus - specific data , such as description , functional annotations ( gene ontology terms , mutant phenotypes ) , or orthologous genes in other species , lsps now also provide access to allele - specific data : dna and protein sequences for both alleles , as well as a listing of allelic variations if they exist . lsps also show graphical representations of the chromosomal context for each allele as thumbnails that lead to genome browser windows and allow farther exploration of a chosen haplotype . assembly 22 allows powerful , allele- and haplotype - specific analyses of the overall genome structure , function and evolution . to facilitate genome - wide research , cgd provides access to all the data in downloadable files that can be used by researchers ' own bioinformatics tools . all dna sequences for the entire chromosomes , coding and non - coding regions , as well as translation products , are available for download at http://www.candidagenome.org / download/. an important part of cgd 's mission is to incorporate and annotate large - scale datasets from published experiments on candida species , and to make them easily available for exploration and analysis by our users . for several years we have provided genexplorer ( 34 ) to display and analyze microarray datasets . recently , to provide access to the growing number of datasets from experiments that use high - throughput sequencing technologies , we have deployed the jbrowse genome browser ( 35 ) . jbrowse is a mature and widely used application that is fast , intuitive , and compatible with most web browsers ( 36 ) . jbrowse allows users to quickly view large - scale sequence data in a genomic context , at multiple zoom - levels of resolution , from base pairs in individual sequence reads to read - density summaries across large genomic regions . the display includes parallel tracks of annotated sequence features , allowing seamless navigation between jbrowse and the locus summary pages for each feature ( figure 1 ) . quantitative tracks graphically display comparative information , such as relative expression level or sequence conservation . jbrowse is highly flexible and customizable : users may easily load their own sequence datasets and analysis tracks , for display in the context of genomic features , or for comparison with datasets and tracks provided by cgd . jbrowse display of the region around the c. albicans serum - inducible gene hwp1 , showing aligned rna - seq reads from serum - treated cells ( 37 ) . the red and blue bars in the top track of the main display window show genes annotated at cgd : red for genes encoded on the  w strand ( + ) , blue for genes on the  c strand (  ) . clicking on a bar brings up an information window for that gene , and includes a link to its cgd locus summary page . the green bar graph below the gene track shows the density of aligned rna - seq reads along to the chromosome , plotted on a log scale . the bottom track shows all the aligned rna - seq reads along the chromosome : each short bar in the bottom track represents a unique read . in this example the sequence reads are strand - specific : pink bars indicate reads transcribed from the w strand , and light - blue bars indicate reads transcribed from the  c strand . clicking on a bar brings up information about the read , including the sequence and quality score for each base . menus and controls at the top of the browser provide navigation , zoom and search functionalities , and allow users to load their own data . we provide the high - throughput dna sequence data ( 33 ) that was the basis of assembly 22 , described above . optional tracks highlight the sequence variation between the two assembly 22 haplotypes , as well as the variation between the common strains sc5314 and wo-1 ( 32 ) . we also make available rna - seq datasets from a number of gene expression studies in c. albicans , including comparisons of different stress conditions ( 37 ) , hyphae - inducing conditions ( 37 ) , biofilm vs. planktonic growth ( 38 ) , white - opaque switching ( 39 ) , and allele - specific expression differences ( 40 ) . in addition , we provide chromatin occupancy data ( chip - seq ) for the wor1p transcription factor during white - opaque switching ( 41 ) . we also have rna - seq datasets for two other candida species : gene expression under ph and nitrosative stress in c. glabrata ( 42 ) , and during biofilm vs. planktonic growth in c. parapsilosis ( 43 ) . we will add new datasets to jbrowse as they become available , and in response to user requests . the reference sequence for an organism is not static  while sequencing technologies continue to advance ( both in accuracy and read lengths ) , there is always the possibility that updates will improve the reference sequence . for example , either pacbio or oxford nanopore sequencing ( very long reads , though with high error rates ) , coupled with existing illumina data ( short reads , but low error rates ) may better resolve telomeric and other repeat sequences , which are hard to resolve even with the original sanger reads . another question is whether the sequence of a single instance of a strain is a reasonable representation of the reference sequence  indeed , given candida albicans propensity to undergo rearrangement and loss of heterozygosity under stress , different lab isolates of ostensibly the same strain might have different sequences . it is likely in the near future that many distinct strains of candida species will be sequenced , and cgd will endeavor to incorporate these into the database as well . they will provide insight into the genomic variation that exists in each of the candida species . additional high throughput sequencing datasets may also allow refinement of the genome annotations , such as novel additional transcripts , or the addition of 5 and 3 utrs to each of the genes . they may also allow the annotation of functional elements within non - transcribed regions , such as transcription factor binding sites from chip - seq studies . cgd will strive to incorporate such refinements as soon as they become available to maintain the reference sequence and annotation current . since its inception in 2004 , cgd has been tasked with maintenance of the primary genome sequence and annotation for the c. albicans reference strain sc5314 . cgd was originally based upon assembly 19 , a diploid , contig -

 identification of these cases underscores the need for strict adherence to postvaccination infection control guidance to avoid transmission of the live virus .",61
"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are a large group of organic compounds that are included in the european union ( eu ) and us environmental protection agency ( us epa ) priority pollutant list due to their mutagenic and carcinogenic properties . the most important sources of pahs have been identified as coke ovens in the production of aluminum , iron , and steel ; heating in power plants and residences ; cooking ; motor vehicle traffic ; environmental tobacco smoke ; and the incineration of waste material . cooking and food processing at high temperatures have been shown to generate various kinds of genotoxic substances or cooking toxicants including pahs . a number of pahs are known for their carcinogenic , mutagenic , and teratogenic properties like benzo(a)anthracene , benzo(b)fluoranthene , benzo(k)fluoranthene , benzo(g , h , i)perylene , benzo(a)pyrene , chrysene , dibenzo(a , h)anthracene , and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene . pahs containing up to four fused benzene rings are known as light pahs and those containing more than four benzene rings are called heavy pahs . light pahs are more volatile , water soluble , and less lipophilic than the heavy pahs , so pahs migrate through the food chain into hydrophobic compartments and thus accumulate in lipid components due to their lipophilic nature [ 68 ] . seven of the pahs have been classified by the us epa as compounds of probable human carcinogens . these are benzo(a)anthracene , benzo(b)fluoranthene , benzo(k)fluoranthene , chrysene , benzo(a)pyrene , dibenzo(a , h)anthracene , and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene . with the aim of minimizing harmful effects on human health , recently , the european union established a maximum level of 2  ng / g wet weight for benzo(a)pyrene ( the marker used for carcinogenic risk of pahs ) in muscle meat of fish . in 2008 , a scientific opinion adopted by the european food safety authority ( efsa , 2008 ) concluded that benzo(a)pyrene alone is not a suitable indicator for the occurrence and toxicity of pahs in food and that eight specified pahs ( pah8 ) , for which oral carcinogenicity data are available , and/or a subgroup of these , pah4 , are more suitable markers . it was further concluded that pah8 would not provide much added value compared to pah4 ( the sum of benzo(a)pyrene , chrysene , benz(a)anthracene , and benzo(b)fluoranthene ) . in september 2012 , benz(a)anthracene , benzo(b)fluoranthene , and chrysene were included in the assessment and recorded together with benzo(a)pyrene as a sum parameter ( group of  pah4  ) , as per regulation ( eu ) number 835/2011 . developed analytical methods include soxhlet extraction , dispersed solid phase extraction , and accelerated solvent extraction coupled to sample cleanup using gel permeation chromatography   which had been used to assess most of pahs in different matrices by changing the technique of cleanup from coextracted interferences that may cause false positive results , but most of these techniques are expensive , use chlorinated solvent for extraction , and are time and chemicals consuming . in 2013 a simple solid phase extraction ( spe ) method   followed by comprehensive two - dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time - of - flight mass spectrometry has been developed for analysis of ( 15 + 1 ) carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) . this method includes three critically assessed sample preparation approaches : ( i ) gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ) , ( ii ) gpc followed by silica based spe , and ( iii ) spe employing pahs - dedicated molecularly imprinted polymers ( mips ) . also in 2013 , two of the most relevant analytical methods including different extraction procedures such as ultrasound - assisted solvent extraction ( usae ) and ultrasound - assisted emulsification microextraction ( usaeme ) for determination of 11 mutagenic and carcinogenic pahs were optimized by the selected extraction techniques . the recoveries ranging from 70% to 100% by usae and from 70% to 108% by usaeme with estimated quantification limits between 0.020 and 2.6  g / kg were achieved . a few researches on the development of quechers analytical method for determination of pahs levels in fish the streamline of quechers ( quick , easy , cheap , effective , rugged , and safe ) method for extraction of pesticides in tissues of high fat ( > 3.5% ) encourages scientists to apply modifications and develop this method in order to extract veterinary drugs   and pahs from seafood such as shrimp   and in fish by using quechers for extraction followed by dispersive spe analysis by gcms in sim mode for quantification . the aim of this study is to adapt and validate quechers method   for extraction followed by solid phase extraction for sample purification and gas chromatography mass spectrometer gcms for determination of 16 pahs in fish at low loq level . the edible parts ( head , bones , and removable skin were removed ) of nonsmoked blank herring fish were obtained and completely homogenized in a food mixer as a blank sample and then stored in a freezer at 20c . acetone ( riedel - de hen , purity 99.8% ) , acetonitrile ( sigma - aldrich , purity > 99.9% ) , toluene ( merck ) , dichloromethane chromatography grade , and n - hexane ( purity > 99.0% ) were the solvents used . agilent quechers salts and buffers were prepackaged in anhydrous packages for en 15662 containing 4  g magnesium sulfate ( mgso4 ) , 1  g sodium chloride ( nacl ) , 1  g sodium citrate , and 0.5  g disodium citrate sesquihydrate . silica gel ( 60120  mesh , fluka ) was activated at 150c for 12 hours prior to use . a 1000  g / ml stock solution of 14 pahs includes naphthalene , fluorene , fluoranthene , benz(a)anthracene , chrysene , pyrene , benzo(b)fluoranthene , benzo(k)fluoranthene , benzo(a)pyrene , acenaphthene , phenanthrene , anthracene , acenaphthylene , and pyrene - d10 ( surrogate standard ) and reference standards obtained from sigma - aldrich with purity > 95% were prepared , while benzo(g , h , i)perylene and dibenz(a , h)anthracene were obtained as readymade of 100  g / ml in methylene chloride and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene 200  g / ml in methanol . a 1  g / ml working solution of all 16 pahs was prepared in toluene . calibration mixtures with concentration 2 , 10 , 50 , 100 , and 500  ng / ml were prepared from serial dilution of the working solution in toluene where pyrene - d10 maintained at level 50  ng / ml in all calibration levels and all stored in refrigerator at 4c . pfte or polyethylene 50  ml tubes with screw cap and 15  ml tubes contain 1  g magnesium sulfate were obtained for sample extraction . centrifuge up to 4000  rpm ( heraeus labofuge 400 ) , vortex , automatic pipettes ( hirschmann laborgerate ) suitable for handling volumes of 10  l to 100  l and 100  l to 1000  l , 10  ml solvent - dispenser ( hirschmann laborgerate ) for acetonitrile . the glassware were washed with detergent and water then rinsed with acetone and dried at 90c before use . the validation procedure needs to be considered , the context of fitness for purpose and cost benefit criteria . about 10  g of fish sample was weighted in 50  ml teflon centrifuge tube , 50  l of 10  g / ml pyrene - d10 was added which acts as surrogate standard of 50  g / kg , and each set of 6 replicates was spiked with 20 , 100 , and 500  l of 1  g / ml spiking mixture to get 2 , 10 , and 50  g / kg , respectively . 10  ml of acetonitrile was used for extraction , shaken for 2 minutes , mixed with agilent quechers , shaken for 1 minute , and centrifuged at 4000  rpm for 5 minutes . aliquots of the resulting supernatant were transferred to teflon tube containing mgso4 , vortexed for 30 seconds , and centrifuged at 4000  rpm for 2 minutes ; 4  ml of the acetonitrile layer was transferred into 50  ml flask and then evaporated near to dryness . all fish extracts were subjected to packed solid phase cleanup cartridge which was prepared in - house as follows . plug a glass wool on 10  ml length syringe ; 1  g 20% deactivated silica gel and 0.2 mgso4 were weighted and conditioned with 5  ml of n - hexane / dichloromethane ( 3  :  2 ) , the sample extract loaded to the cartridge using 10  ml of elute ( n - hexane / dichloromethane ) . collect fractions in a 50  ml flask , evaporate on rotary evaporator at 40cnear to dryness and dissolve in 2  ml toluene and then apply to gcms for analysis . agilent 6890n series gas chromatography instrument equipped with 5975 series mass selective detector and agilent gc column of model j&w hp-5ms ultra inert with the specifications ( 30  m length , 0.25  mm internal diameter , 0.25  m film thickness ) were used for both qualitative and quantitative determination of pahs . helium gas was used as the carrier gas ; the column was maintained at a constant flow rate of 1.3  ml / min . the column temperature was initially held at 90c for 2  min , ramping to 180c at a rate of 15c / min , held at 180c for 15  min , ramping to 250c at a rate of 10c / min , held for 2  min , ramping to 290c at a rate of 10c / min , and held for 10  min . the mass spectrometer was operated in the ionization mode and spectra were acquired using a mass range of 45450  m / z . sim acquisition was carried out by comparison of the base peak of each targeted pah as shown in table 1 . quality control and assurance of each patch were passed by monitoring the performance of the gcms and the mass selective detector daily by tuning the mass detector and monitoring the sensitivity and linearity of the calibration curve , respectively , and also analyzing blank sample to confirm that there in contamination effect on the results during analysis . figure 1 represents overlay between blank and spike fish at level 50  g / kg samples to show the separation of 16 pahs by gcms in 35 minutes using agilent j&w hp-5ms ultra inert gc column ( 30  m length , 0.25  mm internal diameter , and 0.25  m film thicknesses ) . this representative chromatogram of pahs in fish matrix indicates good cleanup separation techniques with minimum interference of coextract that may influence the accuracy of the result . the linearity was obtained by plotting the peak area of each analyte versus its concentration . the linearity of all pahs indicates that both dibenz(a , h)anthracene and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene compounds had r 
  values of 0.996 ; all others were 0.998 or higher within measurement range of 250  g / l indicating excellent linearity . it is the minimum concentration of analyte in the test sample that can be measured with a stated probability that the analyte is present at a concentration above that in the blank sample . limits of detection expressed as three multiplied by sd of the recovery replicates at the lowest expected concentrations ranging between 0.09 and 1.94  g / kg are shown in table 2 . it is the lowest concentration of analyte that can be determined with an acceptable level of uncertainty according to eurachem guideline and it is usually the lowest point on the calibration curve which is 2  g / kg . the analytes were considered to be quantitative when their abundance confirmation ion signal to noise is s / n  3 with an accurate quantitation of 20% of their true value in the calibration standard . sample residues that met all criteria but had s / n < 3 were reported as less than the limit of quantification ( < loq ) while those which had not fit any criteria were reported as not detected ( n.d . ) . the recovery of ( n = 6 ) replicates at each level was calculated and summarized in table 3 which shows very good recovery and excellent rsd . from table 3 , the recovery of each set of 6 replicates was in the range of 56115% where the lower spiking level was selected in order to include the lower concentration of pahs fish muscle fixed at 2  g / kg . the extraction efficiency was consistent over the entire range with indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(g , h , i)perylene being the most affected compounds where their recovery at lower level was 65 and 69% , respectively , and at the second level was 61 and 56% . no significant dispersion of results was observed for the other remaining pahs and recovery did not differ substantially at the lowest and the highest concentrations . according to commission regulation ( ec ) number 1881/2006 and ( ec ) number 333/2007 [ 22 , 23 ] , the maximum level for the determination of pahs in fish was 2  g / kg wet weight and the recovery range of the methods used should be 50120% , indicating that the validated method complies with these criteria . where rsdpooled can be calculated   as(1)rsdpooled = rsd12n11+rsd22n21+n11+n21+.rsd is the relative standard deviation , n is the number of samples , and the equation used to calculate the recovery is ( 2)recovery%=cfce100,where c 
 f is the found concentration and c 
 e is the expected concentration . figures 2 , 3 , and 4 represent mean recovery and rsd% ranges ; most of the pahs recovery was between 70 and 120% with most of rsd less than 10% . the reported results provide evidence that the adapted quechers method achieved for most of the pahs gives good recoveries , repeatability , and reproducibility . using these equations the following relative standard uncertainty u 
 rec = 3.6% and(3)u(rec)=sn . 
  combined uncertainty u 
 c is(4)uc = up2+urec2+uref=6.2% . u 
 p is the uncertainty due to precision experiments . the uncertainty due to reference standard preparation u 
 ref = 0.7 . u 
 p which is the relative standard uncertainty due to precision experiments expressed as relative standard deviation was found to be less than 5% ( the highest pooled rsd% for pyrene ) . expanded uncertainty is obtained by multiplying the combined uncertainty by a coverage factor k. for confidence level of 95% k is 2 . the expanded uncertainty ( at 95% confidence level ) the higher sample weight used in the proposed method ( 10  g ) with accepted solid phase extraction cleanup techniques compared with e1 and e2 quechers acetonitrile based extraction method ( 1  g )   facilitates the ability of lowering the limits of quantification for pahs where the recoveries obtained at 500  g / kg for traditional acetonitrile based quechers extraction using extraction scheme e1 ( 1% acetic acid in acetonitrile and aoac salts ) yield average recoveries less than 67% , with individual pahs recoveries typically ranging from 35 to 87% , also for extraction scheme e2 ( acetonitrile and en salts ) performed equally poorly , with average pahs recoveries being less than 68% and individual pahs recoveries ranging from 24 to 88% , while for the proposed method the individual pahs recoveries range from 65 to 107% at the loq limits ( 2  g / kg ) with method uncertainty equal to 12 ( at 95% confidence level ) indicating that the method is quite fit for purpose with acceptable loq , precision , and accuracy according to commission regulation ( ec ) number 1881/2006 and ( ec ) number 333/2007 . the results found were very promising ; it may be concluded that modified quechers method of extraction followed by cleanup silica gel packed solid phase extraction combined with gcms for quantitation is an efficient method for determination of low concentration of selected group of pahs in homogenized fish samples . this method is suitable for laboratories engaged daily in routine analysis of a large number of samples , and the loq of the method is sufficiently attained low in order to be used in the national monitoring program of egypt for determination of pahs in fish as well as in imported and exported fish following codex regulations .","a gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometer ( gcms ) method was developed and validated for determination of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in fish using modified quick , easy , cheap , effective , rugged , and safe ( quechers ) method for extraction and solid phase extraction for sample cleanup to remove most of the coextract combined with gcms for determination of low concentration of selected group of pahs in homogenized fish samples . 
 pahs were separated on a gcms with hp-5ms ultra inert gc column ( 30  m , 0.25  mm , and 0.25  m ) . 
 mean recovery ranged from 56 to 115% . 
 the extraction efficiency was consistent over the entire range where indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(g , h , i)perylene showed recovery ( 65 , 69% ) , respectively , at 2  g / kg . 
 no significant dispersion of results was observed for the other remaining pahs and recovery did not differ substantially , and at the lowest and the highest concentrations mean recovery and rsd% showed that most of pahs were between 70% and 120% with rsd less than 10% . 
 the measurement uncertainty is expressed as expanded uncertainty and in terms of relative standard deviation ( at 95% confidence level ) is 12% . 
 this method is suitable for laboratories engaged daily in routine analysis of a large number of samples .",305
"mucocele of the appendix ( collection of mucus within the appendiceal lumen ) is a rare lesion , found in only 0.2% to 0.3% of 43,000 appendectomies reviewed . currently , the assessment of pelvic masses relies heavily on usg as the primary diagnostic tool . in such cases , clinical findings and other investigative modalities are warranted to aid the diagnostic process . in spite of extensive preoperative investigations , the diagnosis may still remain elusive and may only be made at the time of surgery . some regard this lesion as benign , a result of obstruction of the proximal lumen by fibrosis ; others believe it to be a neoplasm of the appendix . is the method of choice in the management of simple mucocele and for cystadenoma with an intact base . several studies ( mostly case reports ) on laparoscopic resection of mucocele have been reported . a 60-year - old female presented with pain in lower part of abdomen and palpable tender lump in the right ileac fossa . ultrasound of the abdomen reports a cystic mass of size 12  15 cm with thin internal septations in the right adnexa . the pneumoperitoneum was created with veress needle using carbon dioxide and the pressure was kept at 11 mmhg . a 0 telescope was introduced through the umbilical port for the complete examination of the abdomen . diagnostic laparoscopy revealed approximately 14  15 cm large bluish mucocele of the appendix with omental adhesions . two 5-mm ports were placed in the supra pubic area below the pubic hair line as the working port . the mucocele of the appendix was isolated after separating the mesoappendix from it with the help of bipolar cautery . following this , mucocele of the appendix [ figure 1 ] was retrieved out in a plastic bag through the umbilical port . hemostasis was obtained and a suction drain left in situ which was removed when non - productive . cut section showed appendix was filled with mucin - like material [ figure 2 ] . she was started orally after 4 hours of operation and solid food on the next day . appendicular lump from the distal portion of appendix after removal the appendicular lump filled with mucinus material mucocele of the appendix is a descriptive term for an appendix distended by mucus , secondary to mucinous cystadenoma ( 63% ) , mucosal hyperplasia ( 25% ) , mucinous cystadenocarcinoma ( 11% ) , and retention cyst . clinical presentation may include right lower quadrant pain , change in bowel habits , per rectal bleeding , or a palpable mass . approximately 23 - 50% of patients are asymptomatic , with the lesions being discovered incidentally during surgery , radiological evaluations , or endoscopic procedures . the preoperative clinical diagnosis of appendiceal mucoceles can therefore be difficult because of this lack of clinical symptomotology . the initial detection of the lesion may be facilitated by radiological , sonographic , or endoscopic means . on barium enema , the lesion may be seen as a sharply outlined sub - mucosal or extrinsic mass indenting the cecum and laterally displacing it . purely cystic lesions with anechoic fluid , hypoechoic masses with fine internal echoes as well as complex hyperechoic masses can be seen depending on the contents . ct of the abdomen usually shows a cystic well - encapslated mass sometimes with mural calcification , in the expected location of the appendix . it may be causing extrinsic pressure on the cecal wall without any surrounding inflammatory reaction . colonoscopic findings include the  volcano sign ,  the appendiceal orifice seen in the center of a firm mound covered by normal mucosa or a yellowish , lipoma - like submucosal mass . in our case , usg was unable to provide a preoperative diagnosis . in our case , the decision for excision of the appendiceal mucocele was made as a result of diagnostic laparoscopy and a need to rule out malignancy . therefore mucocele of the appendix can mimic an adnexal mass and prove to be a diagnostic challenge . in a woman presenting with right iliac fossa mass and with clinical features not indicative of gynecological pathology , an appendiceal origin should be considered in the differential diagnosis . surgery is the treatment of choice and should be done early as tumor can not be ruled out as the causative factor for the mucocele . pre - operative diagnosis is important to avoid unintended rupture and the development of pseudomyxoma peritonei during surgery . however , laparoscopic dissection , grasping of the appendix specimen , pneumoperitoneum , or transport of the specimen through the abdominal wall might contribute to peritoneal dissemination of a tumor , if present . these setbacks can be avoided by taking precautions like using bowel holding graspers ( non - traumatic ) to handle the mucocele and using a non - permeable bag to deliver the specimen out of the port . mucocele of the appendix can mimic an adnexal mass and prove to be a diagnostic challenge . laparoscopic resection of mucocele of the appendix is feasible in spite of the danger of malignancy , provided necessary precautions are taken .","mucocele of the appendix is an aseptic dilatation secondary to obstruction . 
 the preoperative clinical diagnosis of appendiceal mucoceles can therefore be difficult because of this lack of clinical symptomotology . 
 surgical excision is the treatment of choice in benign mucocele . 
 we report a case presenting to the surgeons where initial clinical findings and investigations suggested a cyst in the right adnexa . diagnostic laparoscopy revealed mucocele of the appendix and laparoscopic appendicectomy 
 was done .",104
"cervical cancer is the second major cause of cancer - related mortality in women worldwide and accounts for 250,000 deaths each year ( 1 ) . it is well established that the infection with high - risk types of human papillomavirus ( hpv ) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of invasive cervical cancer ( 2 ) . although many women are infected with high - risk types of hpv , only a subset of infected women develops cervical cancer , suggesting that other cofactors including host genetic factors must be present for the development of malignancy . chronic inflammation has been shown to be an important risk factor for a variety of epithelial cancers ( 3 ) . cytokines , as the products of host response to inflammation , play an important role in the defense against viral infections . in cervical cancers , a number of previous reports suggested that chronic inflammation is associated with the precancerous intraepithelial lesion and cancer of uterine cervix ( 4 - 6 ) . the interleukin-1 family of cytokines consists of several members including ineterleukin-1 alpha , interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist . the genes for these cytokines are clustered within a 430-kb segment on human chromosome 2 . interleukin-1 beta is a pro - inflammatory cytokine mainly produced by blood monocytes and tissue macrophages and has been implicated in mediating both acute and chronic inflammation ( 7 ) . recently , a common polymorphic allele of the regulatory region of the il1b gene was found to be associated with increased il-1 production ( 8) . also , the polymorphism in il1b was associated with various human cancers ( 8 - 11 ) . since there were several reports supporting the positive association with increased il1b secretion and cervical cancer risk ( 12 , 13 ) , we hypothesized that an individual with a il1b genotype producing more il1b might have an increased risk of cervical cancer . the c > t polymorphism in il1b -511 site has been correlated with increased intracellular il1b levels in the previous reports ( 14 ) . here we report results from a hospital based case - control study examining the association of il1b -511 c > t polymorphisms with the risk of cervical cancer . case subjects were selected from among cervical cancer patients treated between april 1996 and july 2002 at the seoul national university hospital . a total of 182 patients with confirmed cervical squamous cell carcinoma consented to participate in the study and provided a blood specimen . age -

square test ( d.f.=1 ) . allele frequency differences between cases and controls were analyzed using the pearson chi - square test . cervical cancer risk was estimated by odds ratios ( ors ) and 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) using conditional logistic regression model after adjustment for age . in korean population , we observed that the allelic frequencies of the 182 case subjects ( c , 0.42 ; t , 0.58 ) were not significantly different from those of the 364 control subjects ( c , 0.43 ; t , 0.57 ) . the allelic frequencies of control subjects were not statistically different from those reported for korean populations by other investigators ( 9 ) . we found that carriers of the t allele had a significantly increased risk of cervical cancer . the frequency distribution of the different genotypes for the il1b -511 c > t polymorphism is shown in table 1 . the cc genotype was less frequent among the case subjects than among the control subjects ( 7.7% and 16.8% , respectively ) . with the use of the chi - square test , we found the significant difference in genotype frequencies between case and control subjects ( p<0.001 ) . using the cc genotype as the reference genotype , we performed logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age variable . the ct genotype was associated with significantly elevated or of 2.83 ( 95% ci=1.52 to 5.28 , p<0.001 ) . also , the tt genotype was associated with elevated or of 1.68 ( 95% ci=0.85 to 3.32 , p=0.136 ) . when we combined ct and tt genotypes together , we found that ct and tt genotypes were associated with or of 2.42 ( 95% ci=1.31 to 4.46 , p<0.005 ) . here we reported that -511 polymorphism in il1b gene was associated with the risk of cervical cancer . our findings in this hospital - based case - control study suggest that the carriers of -511 t allele may be at increased risk of developing cervical cancer . our results support the previous hypothesis that -511 t allele is associated with increased production of il-1 , and that il-1 may play a role as host factors promoting cervical carcinogenesis . since it is assumed that the host immune system is important in the surveillance of hpv - related cervical neoplasia , cytokines , including il-1 , have been frequently correlated to a risk of cervical cancer . the level of the il-1 was increased in the cervicovaginal washings of patients with cervical cancer ( 13 ) . individuals with high and intermediate il-1 secretor phenotypes may be more susceptible to lower grade lesions rather than high grade lesion or cervical carcinoma ( 12 ) . elevated vaginal lavage il-1 these evidences , including the results of this study , suggest that il-1 may be involved in early step of cervical carcinogenesis and that individual difference of il-1 secretion may affect individual susceptibility to cervical cancer progression . the polymorphism of il1b gene was reported to be associated with various diseases including cancer , but it is most intensively studied in gastric cancer . el - omar et al . have recently reported that proinflammatory genotypes of the interleukin-1 gene cluster ( il1b -511/-31 and il-1rn*2/*2 ) were associated with increased risk of gastric cancer and its presumptive precursors , gastric atrophy and hypochlorhydria , in white populations from poland and scotland ( 8) . their results contained data that il1b -511 c > t polymorphism was associated with risk of gastric cancer . while explaining this , they addressed that there were no differences in binding activity between il1b -511 genotypes , indicating that the effect of il1b -511 polymorphism may be mediated by linkage disequilibrium with the tata box polymorphism . this may be possible explanation of our finding , no genedosage relationship between -511 genotypes . in consistence with our data , another recent study reported that il1b -511 ct heterozygous genotype was the main risk of intestinal type gastric cancer in korean population ( 9 ) . since our results is the first report about the association between il1b -511 c > t polymorphism and the risk of cervical cancer , we could not compare our results with other data . however , there were several previous reports suggesting the possible association between cervical cancer risk and the polymorphism of other cytokines or cytokine receptors , such as tnf - alpha , interleukin 10 , and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist ( 16 - 21 ) . therefore , it can be speculated that functional variation of inflammatory cytokine may influence on the individual susceptibility of cervical cancer . degradation of the p53 gene by oncogenic hpv e6 protein is the most well known carcinogenic mechanism in human cervical cancer . recent findings indicate an increased p53 mutation load or altered p53 protein function in a number of inflammatory diseases ( 22 ) . it has been shown that , in rats , intratracheal instillation of il-1 caused hydrogen peroxide production in lung tissue , initiated neutrophil influx and stimulated their release of reactive oxygen species ( 23 ) . therefore , it can be speculated that reactive free radicals produced by inflammatory cells may cause dna damage in epithelial cells . inflammatory cytokines have also been shown to induce dna damage and inhibit dna repair in vitro ( 24 ) . in addition , il-1 has been shown to reduce apoptosis by changing the ratio of bcl-2/bax proteins ( 25 ) . therefore , a higher production of il-1 may lead to increased p53 mutation load , and the increased level of il-1 may play a role not only in hpv - related cervical carcinogenesis but also in hpv - non - related cervical carcinogenesis . the limitations of the present study are as follows . second , our sample size is so limited that it has not enough statistical power to exclude the existence of gene - dosage relationship . third , the various epidemiologic risk factors of cervical cancer , such as smoking , alcohol intake , diet , or sexual behavior , were not included for analysis . fourth , since our study did not include all clustered polymorphic site of il1b and associated genes , the haplotype analysis could not be done . so , it would be worthwhile to perform further large - scale population - based study including the analysis of various clustered polymorphisms . it also should be noted that the risk of cancer caused by foreign pathogen such as virus or bacteria was repeatedly reported by numerous study ( 8 , 26 ) . therefore , it can be speculated that increased il-1 production may be associated with host genetic factor defending from foreign carcinogenic pathogen . in conclusion , in korean population , il1b -511 cc genotype was significantly associated with decreased risk of cervical cancer . this relationship supports the idea that polymorphism of inflammatory response genes may be host genetic susceptibility to cervical cancer . il1b polymorphism should be considered as candidate genetic factor in future study elucidating the genetic risk of cervical cancer .","cervical cancer is almost invariably associated with infection by human papillomavirus . 
 it is believed that the host genetic factors such as inflammation - induced cytokines may play a role in cervical carcinogenesis . 
 the il1b gene , encoding il-1 cytokine , contains several single nucleotide polymorphisms . 
 one of them which is in the positions -511 ( c - t ) related with promoter region has been associated with increased il-1 production and with increased risk of developing a number of inflammatory diseases and gastric carcinoma . 
 we assessed the association between the il1b -511 polymorphism and cervical cancer risk in a hospital - based case - control study among 546 korean women ( 182 cases ; 364 age - matched controls ) . 
 the allele frequencies of the case subjects ( c , 0.42 ; t , 0.58 ) were not significantly different from those of control subjects ( c , 0.43 ; t , 0.57 ) . 
 control subjects were in hardy - weinberg equilibrium . 
 the carriers with -511 c / t or t / t genotypes were at higher risk of cervical cancer with odds ratio of 2.42 ( 95% ci 1.31 - 4.46 , p<0.005 ) . however , there was no difference of cervical cancer risk between c / t heterologous genotypes and t / t homologous genotypes . 
 in conclusion , in korean population , il1b -511 c / c genotypes were significantly associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer .",321
"mr urography ( mru ) can be performed with two different imaging strategies : unenhanced mr urography ( t2w - mru ) , based on heavily t2-weighted fse sequences and contrast - enhanced excretory mr urography ( ce - mru ) , which is performed with a 3d ge t1-weighted sequences following intravenous gadolinium administration . a heavily t2-weighted sequence , utilizing the single - shot fast spin - echo ( ssfse ) sequence , provides static  hydrographic  images of fluid inside the urinary tract . it is known to be mainly useful for only evaluating dilated systems , ,   because of its inability to visualize entirely non - dilated ureters . so that , in routine practice , excretory ce - mru is the technique most commonly used to evaluate the non - dilated collecting system . low - dose ( 520  mg ) intravenous furosemide administration has been recommended for excretory ce - mru to improve the visualization of the non - dilated upper urinary tract , . to the best of our knowledge , no recent paper has explored the potential of the repetition of this simple breath hold t2w - mru sequence . our hypothesis was that by using low - dose of furosemide and additional multiple rotations around the ureter may improve the detection of the whole non - dilated ureter as well as mru with intravenous administration of contrast medium and provides a pertinent information . the purpose of this prospective study was to compare those two types of mru in terms of ureteral visualization in patients with non - dilated ureters , using diuretic administration by means of a direct confrontation of each technique in the same patient . to the best of our knowledge , there is no paper in the literature concerning this evaluation . this prospective , single - institution study received approval by our local ethical committee and no written informed consent was necessary . however all patients were orally informed just before the examination of this additional exploration of their urinary tract regarding to the use of a supplementary drug . during a period of 12 months from april 2012 through april 2013 , among a cohort of 155 patients referred to our mr department for a pelvic with retroperitoneal mr exploration , we have selected 126 patients ( extensive endometriosis : 38 patients , various pelvic carcinoma staging : 54 patients , suspicion for retroperitoneal fibrosis : 15 patients , lymph nodes or retroperitoneal masses recurrency : 19 patients ) with bilateral non - dilated ureter who underwent both a 2d t2w - mru immediately followed by an excretory 3d ce - mru . we have excluded from the study the patients with urinary tract dilatation ( n  =  6 ) or urinary symptoms ( n  =  2 ) , moderate renal deficiency or known allergic reaction to medication ( n  =  6 ) and those who had undergone a previous pelvic surgery ( n  =  15 ) ( fig . mr examinations were performed on a 3.0  t mr unit ( achieva , philips medical systems , best , the netherlands ) by using the phased array dedicated coil for pelvic and lower abdomen exploration . the field of view was large enough to cover entirely the retroperitoneum with the exploration of the whole ureter from the uretero pelvic junction to the bladder neck . each patient was explored in addition to our routine protocol for the clinical context with two breath -

injected routine sequences , the patient received an intravenous injection of furosemide at the dose of 20  mg ( lasilix lab sanofi - aventis ) ( fig . patients were orally informed of potential side effects such as increased urination at the end of the exploration . five minutes later a 2d coronal single shot turbo fast se t2-weighted static fluid mru ( t2w - mru ) was performed localized on the right and the left urinary tract with an acquisition time of 5  s. each sequence was repeated nine times with coronal rotations and cine loop registration on each urinary tract . at the end of this first mru sequence , an intravenous injection of 0.2  ml / kg body weight gadolinium - based contrast medium , ( dotarem , guerbet , roissy cdg , france ) followed by a 15  ml saline five minutes later , coronal excretory phase mr urogram was obtained by means of a 3d breath - hold t1-weighted ge sequence with an acquisition time from 15 to 18  s ( table 1 ) . maximum - intensity - projection ( mip ) images were processed from the original source images of this excretory mru . the two types of mru , including original source images and mip reformations available from the workstation , were retrospectively reviewed . each sequence was evaluated separately and independently by two radiologists ( phh , ga ) with five and three years of experience in abdominal mr imaging , respectively . disagreements were checked by consensus with a third radiologist ( cr ) with twenty years experienced in that field to find a consensus . the readings were done in several sessions and in each session ; it was given to each reviewer a random combination of isolated mru with native images and mip . readers were neither informed of the clinical context nor the radiological report done by the radiologist who was in charge of the examination . readers evaluated the whole technical image quality with the precise criterion of the presence of disturbing artifacts such as ghosting or pulsation artifacts using a four points subjective scale ( 1  poor , 2  fair , 3  good , 4  excellent ) . the distension of the ureter on ce - mru was compared with that of obtained on t2w - mru and quoted as higher or equal . based on visual assessment , readers were asked to score four segments of each ureter . the lumbar ureter was divided in two segments : a proximal part ( from the pelvic junction to the level of the lower pole of the kidney ) ( pl ) and a distal part ( from the lower pole of the kidney and iliac crest ) ( dl ) . the pelvic ureter was also checked with two segments : an upper portion from iliac vessels to mid pelvic cavity ( pp ) and an inferior portion from mid pelvic cavity to the bladder ( dp ) . , readers were asked to evaluate independently one rotation ( chosen as strictly anteroposterior view ) , 6 rotations and finally the entire sequence ( 9 rotations ) . for ce - mru , they were asked to quote the number of entire ureter identified on mip images . the kappa statistic was used to measure the degree of interobserver agreement for qualitative assessment . strength of agreement was classified as poor (  value less than or equal to 0.20 ) , fair (  value between 0.21 and 0.40 ) , moderate (  value between 0.41 and 0.60 ) , substantial (  value between 0.61 and 0.80 ) , or excellent (  value between 0.81 and 1.0 ) . we used the wilcoxon test to compare the scoring of the segmental analysis of our two mru techniques . a p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant . this prospective , single -

mru and ce - mru , respectively ) . comparison of the two sets of images revealed no significant difference with respect to overall image quality ( 3.8    0.5 vs 3.6    0.7 , p value : 0.13 ) . statistically , the interobserver agreement was excellent with a  correlation coefficient as high as 0.89 for t2w - mru and 0.92 for ce - mru , respectively . one rotation of t2w - mru was found clearly inaccurate to assess the non - dilated ureter . increasing the number of rotations , significantly improved the visualization of all segments . with 9 rotations and regard to identification , there were no statistically significant differences in the visualization of the ureteral segments between the two types of mru . the lumbar distal portion of the ureter was less pertinent for identification on t2w - mru with a sensitivity of 71% vs 78% for ce - mru ( table 2 ) . both segments up and down the pelvic ring have less than excellent identification in both mru techniques by comparison with two others . a bilateral entirely opacified ureteral column until the vesicoureteral junction was found in 236/252 cases with ce - mru , simulating a mild obstruction . on the contrary , on one rotation of t2w - mru , it was constantly found at least one segment , indicating that the others were collapsed . the ureter was visualized as a linear thicker structure than on t2w - mru ( fig . deviation of the pelvic ureter due to the genital tract was found in 118 ureteral segments equally recognized on both sequences ( fig . deviations due to ovarian cysts and follicules were easier to diagnose on t2w - mru than on standard t2 sequence . mru permits an evaluation of the urinary tract without the exposure to ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast medium . t2w - mru was the first sequence to be proposed to study excretory urinary tract . its initial relatively low resolution has been improved by the development of heavily t2-weighted turbo spin - echo sequences such as rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement ( rare ) utilizing multiple thin - slices with mip or a thick - slice imaging technique and half - fourier acquisition single - shot turbo spin - echo ( haste ) sequences . high - resolution thick - slice images can be achieved during a single breath - hold . however , in the literature , t2w - mru is known to have several limitations . these include the superimposition of hyperintense extraurinary fluid collections on thick slice mru , no functional information and undetectable small stones . the inability of t2-w mru to fully visualize complete non - dilated ureters is cited as a major negative point in many papers , , , . finally , t2w - mru has been shown to be a rapid and non - invasive imaging technique which is useful and reliable to reveal hydronephrosis and perirenal high - intensity signals in acute urinary obstruction , , , . the concept of ce - mru has been developed later . in his initial experimental study , nolte - ernsting et al .   presented the advantages of this imaging technique in retrieving high - spatial - resolution images in non - obstructed urinary tracts . the use of a paramagnetic contrast agent permits the evaluation of renal excretory function and better visualization of the non - dilated urinary tract . several papers , , ,   have advocated the need for a diuretic to optimize the endoluminal concentration of gadolinium and to produce accelerated distention . these authors stated that furosemide initially induces an increase in urine volume resulting in mild distention of the urinary tract , and then there is a dilution effect on the excreted gadolinium . the limitation of ce - mru is for cases with delayed excretion due to severe obstruction , the long duration of examination for revealing the underlying abnormality increasing patient and personnel inconvenience , . as several previous papers have shown the superiority of enhanced over unenhanced imaging , ce - mru is becoming in clinical routine practice the technique most commonly used to evaluate the non - dilated collecting system . to our knowledge , in the previous recent literature in adult , there are no clinical studies comparing those two mru techniques in the same patient . additionally , our evaluation has been focused on the non - dilated ureter , which is considered as being the most difficult task to obtain a visualization of all segments . as the use of low - dose ( 520  mg ) intravenous furosemide administration is essential to perform ct urography ; we have also used this medication at the dose of 20  mg to adequately distend the non - dilated ureter . in addition , it causes no real additional cost as it has a very low price . this t2w - mru sequence , with its short acquisition time , permits repeated series of breath - hold images in several coronal oblique orientations , thus providing obvious improvement to the use of this sequence previously described by other investigators . our results attest that furosemide alone is sufficient to distend and visualize all parts . in identifying ureteral segments our results with t2w - mru were quite similar to those of ce - mru , except for the lower part of abdominal ureter . image quality was excellent in all patients , and , unlike other investigators , we never have difficulty in removing superimposed fluid - filled bowel loops by changing the orientation by rotations . a potential advantage of t2w - mru over ce - mru is that it can reveal an ovarian cyst or follicles which cause a deviation of the pelvic ureter . another advantage might be the evaluation of an inflammatory process , due to the superiority of t2-weighted sequences in revealing edema and a small amount of ascites . the ability to identify one or two different segment by rotation is an indicator for normal contractions of some parts of the ureter . this visualization of the peristalsis is a good indicator to affirm that there is no ureteral repercussion for instance of a pelvic mass . in contrary when using ce - mru , we have commonly found the entire column simulation mild obstruction . the size of ureter on ce - mru was larger than on t2w - mru with the same dose of diuretic . we suggest that the contrast medium itself is a significant factor to distend the ureter and produces rapidly an over distended bladder with a risk of false positive diagnosis of mild obstruction . we could not attribute this aspect to our protocol firstly because patients were asked to void their bladder just before the beginning of the mr examination , secondly because the two sequences were performed without any supplementary delay between them ( 5  min to obtain the excretory phase after gadolinium administration ) . in addition , t2w - mru has the advantage of obtaining high quality images in a few seconds , without need for multiplanar and mip reconstructions in the contrary of ce - mru . as breath - hold t2w - mru with intravenous diuretic and multiple rotations is sufficient to produce a qualitative study of non - dilated ureter with identification of the peristaltism , we can speculate that it could be an adequate sequence to detect an initial ureteral involvement before hydronephrosis occurs . the identification of the same missing segment on all rotations with a persistent non - dilated column above could reflect an abnormal peristaltism indicating a thorough analysis of this localization . this can be potentially very useful in the cases of extrinsic ureteral involvement such as in endometriosis which is progressive and clinically silent or can be confuse with other symptoms of the disease . the identification of the same segment on all rotations can be a clue for this initial diagnosis , before the classical appearance of persistent column with gradual tapering or filling defect at the level of obstruction . however , it needs further investigation to prove that t2-mru can detect initial obstruction , prior to clinical presentation of hydronephrosis . it could also be used to evaluate potential renal donors or in patients unable to receive gadolinium . even if our material has an important number of cases , this study has some limitations . first , there is no data regarding the relative performance of the techniques in a clinical context , but we would like to focus on the ability of t2w - mru to visualize the entire ureter . second , even if our field of view was large enough to obtain an evaluation of the whole ureter it does not permit a constant evaluation of the renal pelvic cavities , especially for our tallest patients . however a precise caliceal anatomy or pathology was not the purpose of our mr examinations . of course , equally to ce - mru , the major drawback of t2w - mru remains its poor sensitivity in detecting calcifications . the t2w - mru sequence performed with multiple coronal orientations and diuretic administration is sufficient to identify entirely the non - dilated ureter . our series was large enough to suggest that pelvic mr imaging combined with t2w - mru allows a complete work - up in a single imaging evaluation , especially if gadolinium injection is not necessary or contraindicated . the authors confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome . the authors confirm that any aspect of the work covered in this manuscript that has involved human patients has been conducted with the ethical approval of all relevant bodies and that such approvals are acknowledged within the manuscript .",highlightst2w - mru with multiple orientations and diuretic is sufficient to identify non - dilated ureter.t2w-mru offers information on ureteral contractions and could be proposed to detect initial obstruction before hydronephrosis occurs ( for instance in cases of endometriosis).t2w - mru could also be used to evaluate potential renal donors or in patients unable to receive gadolinium.ce-mru rapidly produces an overdistended bladder with a risk of false positive diagnosis of mild obstruction.ce-mru is less convenient for patients .,113
"new - onset diabetes after transplantation ( nodat ) represents a common comorbidity after solid organ transplantation . nodat after kidney transplantation is associated with inferior outcomes , including higher risk of infections , decreased graft survival , higher rates of cardiovascular disease , and increased overall mortality [ 15 ] . risk factors for nodat include use of immunosuppressants , in particular corticosteroids and calcineurin - inhibitors , as well as traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes including obesity , family history , age , and ethnicity [ 68 ] . metformin is the first - line agent of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the general population . though some data suggests metformin is safe in the setting of chronic kidney disease , the use of metformin in kidney transplant patients is still quite controversial due to the concern about lactic acidosis and lack of data regarding metformin use in this patient population [ 911 ] . therefore , it is important to identify an alternative first - line oral agent for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . short - term studies have shown some oral antihyperglycemic agents to be effective in patients with nodat [ 1214 ] . however , use of these agents is limited by adverse effects including fluid retention and bone loss with pioglitazone and hypoglycemia and weight gain with insulin secretagogues [ 12 , 15 , 16 ] . sitagliptin , an oral dipeptidyl - peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitor , was approved in the united states in 2006 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes . sitagliptin has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and does not promote weight gain , and the dosage can be adjusted based on renal function . additionally , in a 3-month trial of kidney transplant recipients , sitagliptin use did not alter immunosuppressant levels . however , evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of long - term use of sitagliptin in kidney transplant recipients is lacking . we hypothesized that in kidney transplant recipients sitagliptin would improve nodat control , as assessed by hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) , with a favorable safety profile including no effect on immunosuppressant levels or graft function . in this single center study , we performed a retrospective analysis of kidney transplant recipients in the multidisciplinary transplant clinic at the university of nebraska medical center ( unmc ) between october 2006 ( release date of sitagliptin in the united states ) and december 2012 . all subjects in this study received their kidney transplant at unmc . between 2009 and 2013 , 125 to 149 kidney transplants were performed per year at unmc ( http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/ ) . we have previously reported an incidence of nodat of 18% in our kidney transplant population . the study was approved and monitored by the unmc institutional review board . a general query was performed to identify all kidney transplant recipients who had been prescribed sitagliptin during the study dates . data for the query and subsequent data collection for the study were obtained from review of the electronic medical records centricity ( ge healthcare ) , ottr ( ottr chronic care solutions ) , and epic ( epic systems corporation ) . inclusion criteria for the study included diagnosis of nodat by the 2003 international consensus guidelines criteria ( fasting plasma glucose 126  mg / dl or 7.0 mmol / l after no caloric intake for at least 8 hours or random plasma glucose 200  mg / dl or 11.1  mmol / l with symptoms of diabetes or 2  h plasma glucose in a 75  g oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) 200  mg / dl or 11.1  mmol / l ) and diabetes care received at the unmc diabetes center to allow for accurate record of diabetes medication changes and reporting of side effects . additionally , to specifically understand the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat , patients included in the study either used sitagliptin as the initial agent for nodat or had other diabetes medications stopped prior to or at the time of sitagliptin initiation . exclusion criteria included diagnosis of diabetes prior to transplant and death or loss of followup prior to 12 months after initiation of sitagliptin . sitagliptin dosing was performed based on the patients ' renal function , as directed by the prescribing information for sitagliptin ( https://www.merck.com/ ) . initiation of sitagliptin therapy marked the start of followup for each patient and patients were followed up until discontinuation of sitagliptin or december 2012 , whichever came first . the first was a 12-month followup to assess the subacute efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in terms of diabetes control , side effects , immunosuppressant levels , and graft function . the second endpoint was at discontinuation of sitagliptin or , for those patients who continued on sitagliptin through the entire study , in december 2012 . this longer followup allowed for assessment of long - term efficacy and safety in terms of diabetes control , acute rejection episodes , allograft function , and other side effects . the patient medical records were reviewed in detail for a number of different diabetes and transplant - specific outcomes including dates of sitagliptin initiation / discontinuation ; dates of initiation / discontinuation of any other diabetes medications ; patient or physician - reported side effects ; reason for discontinuation of sitagliptin ; acute rejection episodes ; graft loss ; immunosuppressant regimens and dosages ; opportunistic infections ; and death . body mass index ( bmi ) was obtained at the time of transplant , at the time of sitagliptin initiation , after 12 months of sitagliptin therapy , and at the end of followup . as part of routine posttransplant and diabetes care , patients underwent fasting labs weekly to monthly at the clinical laboratory of the nebraska medical center including serum creatinine , tacrolimus and/or sirolimus trough levels ( as appropriate ) , and fasting glucose levels . hba1c was performed every 3 months and fasting lipid panel every 3 to 6 months . serum creatinine , fasting serum glucose , hdl cholesterol , and ldl cholesterol measurements were performed using standard calibration protocols and dedicated analyzers and were assayed by colorimetric means . tacrolimus and hba1c was performed on a national glycohemoglobin standardization program ( ngsp ) certified high - pressure liquid chromatography ( hplc ) analyzer . estimated gfr ( egfr ) was calculated using the modification of diet in renal disease ( mdrd ) equation . a total of 65 patients were identified to have received sitagliptin after kidney transplant during the study dates . of these , 37 patients met criteria for nodat ( figure 1 ) . of these 37 patients , a total of 15 were excluded from the study : 9 patients who obtained their diabetes care at outside clinics and clear records of diabetes medication adjustments were not available ; 1 patient who was deceased 8 months after sitagliptin initiation ; and 5 patients because sitagliptin was added to other diabetes medications . the remaining twenty - two ( 22 ) patients met inclusion criteria and had at least one year of followup and were subsequently analyzed . this cohort of 22 patients does include long - term followup of eight of the fifteen patients analyzed previously at our center in a 3-month prospective study of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat . baseline characteristics of the 22 patients included in the study are shown in table 1 . of the 22 patients , nodat was diagnosed in 21 by fasting blood glucose 7.0  mmol / l on two occasions ; one patient was diagnosed with random blood glucose > 11.1  mmol / l with symptoms of diabetes . a majority of patients utilized tacrolimus - based immunosuppression with the addition of either sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil ( table 1 ) . hepatitis c has been reported to be a risk factor for nodat ; however , none of our subjects were hepatitis c positive . sitagliptin was the initial diabetes medication for a majority of the patients ( 16/22 ) . a total of twenty - two patients were analyzed at the end of 12 months of sitagliptin therapy . of these , 19 patients remained on sitagliptin alone as their only diabetes medication , one patient required initiation of an additional oral diabetes medication , and 2 patients had sitagliptin discontinued in favor of other diabetes medications due to hyperglycemia . diabetes control , as noted by hba1c , was significantly improved at the end of 6 months and this effect persisted at 12 months ( figure 2(a ) ) . significance remained when analyzing just those patients ( n = 19 ) who remained on sitagliptin alone for the entire 12 months ( data not shown ) . there was a modest but significant decrease in bmi from the start of sitagliptin to the 12-month followup ( figure 2(b ) ) , though certainly this weight loss may have been due to multiple factors including lifestyle modifications . ldl and hdl cholesterol values remained unchanged with sitagliptin therapy ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) . at the 12-month followup , graft function as noted by serum creatinine and estimated gfr ( egfr ) was no different than at start of sitagliptin ( figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) ) . we then reviewed immunosuppressant levels over the 12 months of followup and also meticulously reviewed medical records for immunosuppressant dose changes and , if changes to dose were made , the impetus for doing so . tacrolimus and sirolimus levels remained stable throughout the 12-month followup ( figures 3(d ) and 3(e ) ) . in tacrolimus - treated patients , for the remainder of tacrolimus - treated patients only 3 patients required a single protocol dose adjustment and the rest maintained consistent tacrolimus doses . similarly , the patient with noncompliance required frequent sirolimus dose adjustments during the follow - up period while 3 patients had single , protocol - related sirolimus dose adjustments . to assess the long - term efficacy and risk for adverse effects of sitagliptin in kidney transplant recipients , we followed our cohort from the initiation of sitagliptin until december 2012 or discontinuation of sitagliptin , whichever came first ( mean followup for all 22 patients = 32.5  17.8 months ) . in the cohort , 17/22 patients remained on sitagliptin throughout the study period , for a mean duration of sitagliptin use of 37.9  16.5 months . of these 17 patients , 9 remained on sitagliptin alone for the entirety of the study ( 31.8  18.7 months ) . diabetes was well controlled in this group , with hba1c maintained below 7% ( 6.5  0.5% ) at the end of followup ( figure 4(a ) ) . eight patients continued on sitagliptin for the duration of the study ( 44.9  10.9 months ) but required addition of other diabetes medications to maintain glycemic control ( oral agents , n = 4 ; insulin , n = 4 ) . hba1c remained well controlled in this group ( figure 4(b ) ) and two of the four patients on insulin required only basal insulin in addition to sitagliptin . therefore , five patients discontinued sitagliptin in favor of other diabetes medications after 14  4.2 months . of these , 4 patients discontinued sitagliptin due to worsening hyperglycemia ( figure 4(c ) ) and need for intensive insulin therapy while one patient was switched from sitagliptin to a sulfonylurea due to cost . hemoglobin a1c was significantly lower at baseline in patients who were able to continue on sitagliptin alone for the duration of the study ( n = 9 ) compared to patients who discontinued sitagliptin and were switched to more aggressive diabetes management ( n = 5 ) ( figure 4(d ) ) . change in bmi , from sitagliptin initiation to the end of followup , was no different between these groups ( sitagliptin alone : 0.8  2.2 kg / m versus sitagliptin discontinued : 1.1  1.7  kg / m , p = ns ) suggesting the need for intensification of diabetes therapy in the sitagliptin discontinuation group was not necessarily related to weight gain . glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) therapies have been implicated to potentially increase the risk of pancreatitis , a matter of significant controversy . in the current study , no episodes of pancreatitis were reported during the follow - up period . additionally , other transplant - specific adverse events were rare in our cohort , including one episode of acute rejection ( 47 months after sitagliptin initiation ) ; two episodes of opportunistic infections ( 13 and 14 months after sitagliptin initiation ) ; no graft loss ; and one death ( due to end - stage liver disease ) . our study represents the largest cohort investigating the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . though our study was retrospective , through meticulous review of the medical records of patients followed up primarily in our transplant endocrine clinic we were able to closely follow medication prescribing changes , laboratory values , and reports of potential side effects and transplant - related comorbid events . in our cohort , sitagliptin was efficacious with a majority of patients meeting a goal hba1c < 7% . specifically , sitagliptin alone was adequate to improve and maintain glycemic control in a majority of patients ( 19/22 ) for 12 months after sitagliptin initiation , consistent with its efficacy in the nontransplant population [ 21 , 22 ] . sitagliptin inhibits dpp-4 with several subsequent effects that improve blood glucose control including potentiation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion . in studies utilizing animal models of type 2 diabetes , sitagliptin has also been shown to reduce islet inflammation and protect beta cell mass [ 2325 ] . beta cells exposed to glp-1 in vitro are resistant to toxicities associated with immunosuppressants , suggesting another potential benefit to dpp-4 inhibitor therapy for the treatment of nodat . these beta cell - specific protective effects of sitagliptin may explain why , in our cohort , patients with lower baseline hba1c responded better to sitagliptin monotherapy as these patients may have been earlier into the disease and may have had more beta cell mass that was subsequently protected by sitagliptin . overall , these findings suggest that initiating sitagliptin therapy early in the treatment of nodat , when average glucose levels are only modestly elevated , may provide long - term benefits in terms of glycemic control . larger cohorts are needed to investigate this point further . in solid organ transplant recipients , drug - drug interactions and adverse effects of medications on graft function we set out to better define the safety profile of sitagliptin in kidney transplant recipients in terms of effects on immunosuppressant levels / dosing , graft function , and other side effects . renal function and tacrolimus and sirolimus dosing and trough levels remained stable during the initial 12-month follow - up period , indicating sitagliptin does not adversely affect renal function or interfere with immunosuppressant dosing . hypoglycemia was not encountered in our cohort , consistent with reports of sitagliptin use in the nontransplant population . the use of dpp-4 inhibitors for the treatment of hyperglycemia and nodat in kidney transplant recipients is gaining more interest . recently , a 3-month clinical trial of vildagliptin , another oral dpp-4 inhibitor , revealed that this agent improved oral glucose tolerance test outcomes and modestly improved hemoglobin a1c in kidney transplant recipients with impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) . similarly , a small , randomized control trial recently revealed vildagliptin to be a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . finally , a 24-week retrospective study of linagliptin suggests this agent may be beneficial for treating nodat , as well . however , data regarding sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients is scarce . a single pilot study of 15 patients followed up for 3 months revealed no significant effect of sitagliptin on renal function ( as measured by estimated gfr ) or tacrolimus or sirolimus levels . additionally , iuppa et al . presented an abstract discussing the use of sitagliptin in solid organ transplant recipients and , although most of the subjects were liver transplant recipients , 18 kidney transplant recipients were reported on with a median followup of all patients ( kidney and liver transplant recipients ) of 178 days . these small trials and a case report of a single kidney transplant recipient treated with sitagliptin for 2.5 years encompass the entire literature available on this subject . our study provides the most person - years of followup of any trial of sitagliptin for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . additionally , though retrospective , our study provides the longest followup of any dpp-4 inhibitor used for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients . limitations of our study include the retrospective nature of our study and the small cohort size . however , large , prospective studies regarding glucose - lowering therapy for nodat do not exist currently ( as reviewed ) and our study represents the largest study to date examining the use of sitagliptin in the setting of nodat after kidney transplantation . our cohort was comprised mostly of caucasian males and steroids were not part of the maintenance immunosuppressant regimen . these factors may limit the ability to generalize our findings . finally , our mean time to diagnosis of nodat ( 56.3  57.7 months after transplant ) was longer than many studies of nodat . this likely reflects that the patients in our cohort had slower , less aggressive development of nodat and did not require insulin therapy . kidney transplant recipients with viable grafts remain at higher risk of diabetes development , a significant portion of the risk being ascribed to immunosuppressant therapy . safe , effective therapies are needed for patients who develop nodat regardless of the timing of the diagnosis , and sitagliptin may be useful for this purpose given the favorable side effect profile and lack of interaction with immunosuppressant medications . in conclusion , we have shown that , in a small cohort of kidney transplant recipients who developed nodat , sitagliptin was efficacious as a single agent or in combination with other glucose - lowering medications . sitagliptin was also well tolerated and renal function and immunosuppressant levels and dosing were stable during 12 months of therapy . sitagliptin may be valuable as a first - line agent in kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with nodat who are candidates for oral therapy .","new - onset diabetes after transplantation ( nodat ) is a common comorbidity after renal transplantation . 
 though metformin is the first - line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , in renal transplant recipients , metformin is frequently avoided due to concerns about renal dysfunction and risk for lactic acidosis . 
 therefore , alternative first - line agents for the treatment of nodat in renal transplant recipients are needed . 
 sitagliptin , a dipeptidyl - peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitor , has a low incidence of hypoglycemia , is weight neutral , and , in a small study , did not affect immunosuppressant levels . however , long - term sitagliptin use for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients has not been studied . 
 we retrospectively analyzed renal transplant recipients diagnosed with nodat and treated with sitagliptin to assess safety and efficacy . 
 twenty - two patients were started on sitagliptin alone . 
 after 12 months of followup , 19/22 patients remained on sitagliptin alone with a significant improvement in hemoglobin a1c . 
 renal function and immunosuppressant levels remained stable . 
 analysis of long - term followup ( 32.5  17.8 months ) revealed that 17/22 patients remained on sitagliptin ( mean hemoglobin a1c 
 < 7% ) with 9/17 patients remaining on sitagliptin alone . 
 transplant - specific adverse events were rare . 
 sitagliptin appears safe and efficacious for the treatment of nodat in kidney transplant recipients .",338
"patients with spinal cord injuries ( sci ) have motor and sensory disorders , resulting in 
 disabilities in daily activities1 . 
 although they should receive intensive care and rehabilitation treatment after injury , most 
 patients experience disorders ( e.g. , impingement syndrome , osteoarthritis , bursitis , 
 paralysis , parasthesia ) in their upper extremities , trunk , or lower extremities due to 
 physiological and physical changes . they experience functional disorders in ambulation , 
 particularly with respect to activities of daily living ( adl)2 , 3 . due to these ambulatory 
 disorders , spinal cord injury patients often use wheelchairs and learn to perform basic adl 
 ( e.g. propulsion , lifting , transfer ) in relation to the use of a wheelchair . these patients often suffer upper extremity pain due to performance of adl almost 
 exclusively by the upper extremities ( overall upper extremity pain prevalence rates : 58.5% ; 
 shoulder : 71% , elbow : 35% , wrist : 53% , hand : 43%)4 , and such pain impedes the performance of adl5 . among the basic adl , transfer is a task that is performed 
 by each patient 1520 times per day , on average . this is the most burdensome task for the 
 musculoskeletal system , the nervous system , and the cardiovascular system among wheelchair 
 related adl . in particular sitting pivot transfer ( spt ) is the most frequently used transfer method using the upper 
 extremities . using this method , the hip is moved from the initial seat ( iseat ) to the target 
 seat ( tseat ) using the trailing hand ( th ) and the leading hand ( lh ) while both lower 
 extremities maintain contact with the floor as an axis6 . one is a translational 
 strategy in which the head and the hip move horizontally in the same direction , and the 
 other is a rotational strategy in which the head and the hip move while rotating in 
 different directions using both feet as a pivot2 . during spt movements , the shoulder is in a position of internal 
 rotation and abduction , which will invariably cause shoulder impingement unless other aids 
 are used6 . although there are many 
 shoulder pain treatment methods , the shoulder can not take any rest because of transfer 
 movements , which are essential for patients adl . recently , some studies have been conducted of methods for minimizing shoulder injuries 
 through dynamic analyses of transfer movements . according to a recent study , spt is the most 
 efficient and imposes the lowest loads on individual joints when the wheelchair moves 
 horizontally without any variation in floor height compared to when there are differences in 
 height between the position of the wheelchair and the floor on which the wheelchair 
 moves8 . a previous study using kinematic analysis of spt movements reported that , in an experiment 
 conducted to measure loads on the shoulder joint in three different positions , anterior 
 trunk positions mobilized large muscles around the shoulder and the mobilization of muscles 
 reduced the risk of rotator cuff impingement2 . the maximum flexor momentum at the shoulder joint during spt 
 movements is known to be approximately 1.45 nm / kg at the th and approximately 1.36 nm / kg at 
 the lh of patients and approximately 1.56 nm / kg in healthy adults9 . joint reaction force is known to be always higher at th 
 than at lh , and joint loads are known to be higher during transfer to higher seats10 . in a recent study of human movement , it was reported that the destabilizing force ( df ) , 
 which tends to make movements , was determined by the height of the center of mass ( com ) , 
 center of pressure ( cop ) , base of support ( bos ) , and the reaction force and shear force 
 acting on the floor11 . in a study of the 
 df and stabilizing force ( sf ) occurring in spt movements , it was reported that low df and 
 high sf were shown , and that the low df and high sf were related to the securing of 
 stability against the risk of falls12 , 13 . nevertheless , no study to date has been conducted on changes in loads on the lower 
 extremities during actual spt in relation to decreases in bos and increases in the height of 
 the com . studies of 
 transfer methods that will reduce the burden on the upper extremity will contribute to the 
 relief of shoulder pain eventually leading to the prevention of paraplegic patients 
 shoulder pain . therefore , the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of 
 different heights of the hands of the supporting arms on the loads on the shoulder joint 
 during transfer movements in order to seek effective and safe transfer methods . the subjects of the present study were recruited from among students , who voluntarily 
 wanted to participate in the study , attending in hallym college located in chuncheon - si . 
 based on the principles of the declaration of helsinki , research ethics , the purpose and 
 contents of the study were sufficiently explained to the subjects before they participated 
 in the experiment , and they were required to submit their written informed consent . the 
 subjects had no history of musculoskeletal system disease of their upper extremity . among 
 the recruited subjects , only 18 adult males participated in the experiment : excluding those 
 who could not lift their trunk because their upper extremity muscle strength was not 
 sufficient to perform spt movements and those who could not wear the tight suit for motion 
 analysis were excluded . the iseat and tseat of the device specially designed for spt were made from 30  
 50  cm sized 3.2  mm thick steel plates , and the plates for th and lh were made 
 using 60  50  cm sized steel plates of the same thickness as the seats . for 
 height adjustment , hand jerks that could endure at least 2,000 kgf were fixed by welding 
 between the steel plates . thereafter , 1  cm diameter holes were drilled at the four corners 
 of the welded steel plated using a laser . long steel bolts were inserted through the holes 
 to fix the upper and lower steel plates of the iseat and tseat . the th and lh plates were 
 fixed with bolts in order to minimize vibration or shaking caused by loads during transfer 
 movements . then , 20  cm high aluminum profiles were fastened to the two fixed steel plates 
 using bolts so that the final height could be adjusted to between 35  cm and 65  cm . prior 
 to the experiment , audio - visual education on the rotational strategy among spt method was 
 conducted along with a verbal explanation . the subjects moved from the iseat at a height of 50  cm to the tseat 
 at the same height at an angle of 90. the subjects adopted a posture with the th located as 
 close as possible to the hip on the iseat and the lh located as close as possible to the 
 tseat . to keep the same hand positions for all subjects , the shape of a hand was printed and 
 attached to the positions of the th and the lh on the force plates ( fig . the trailing hand and the leading hand were 
 placed on the hand shaped marks attached to the force plates and the initial seat and 
 the target seat were placed immediately next to the two hand positions . the leading hand were 
 placed on the hand shaped marks attached to the force plates and the initial seat and 
 the target seat were placed immediately next to the two hand positions . the angle 
 between the two tables was set to 90 after the verbal order start  , the subjects moved from the iseat to the tseat by lifting 
 their hips solely using the strength of their arms . at this time , the subjects were 
 instructed to limit the activity of their lower extremities maximally . then , the subjects 
 performed the same movement after reducing the height of the th and the lh plates by 10  cm . the height of 50 or 40  cm was randomly selected to eliminate order effects . the subjects took a sufficient rest 
 of one minute between each movement . during the spt movements , if a subject complained of 
 pain in any part of the upper extremity , the experiment was immediately stopped . in the present study , the time labeled at which loading occurred on the force plate below the lh after the 
 verbal order start  was labeled event1 , and the time at which the loading became 0 at the 
 th plate , when the transfer to the tseat had been completed , was labeled event2 . the angles of the movements of the upper extremity and the trunk were measured using a 
 motion analyzer ( oqus100 , qualisys , sweden ) . before the experiment , the study subjects wore 
 upper and lower body stockings that clung to their body shapes , and 15  mm diameter 
 reflective markers , that could be recognized by infrared cameras , were attached to the c7 
 and t10 vertebrae , jugular notch , xiphoid process of the sternum , head ( left / right forehead 
 and rear head ) , acromion , upper arms , humeral lateral epicondyles , wrist lateral / medial 
 epicondyles of the wrists , 2nd metacarpal heads , and asis and psis . the light signals 
 reflected individual markers were recorded using six cameras and qtm ( qualisys , sweden ) at a 
 rate of 100 frames per second . the body joints and segments in the obtained data were 
 labeled , and the kinematics of individual joints and segments were quantitatively analyzed 
 using visual 3d software ( c - motion , usa ) . to reduce measurement errors , the markers for 
 motion analysis force plates ( 9260aa6 , kistler , switzerland ) were used to measure the external force 
 generated by the upper extremities while spt movements were being performed . the voltages 
 measured at different loads were amplified through an amplifier ( 5233a2 , kistler , 
 switzerland ) and transmitted to the computer through an a / d board ( usb-2533 , measurement 
 computing corporation , usa ) . then , the values of the force applied to the force plates by 
 external loads were calculated using qtm motion analysis software program . kinetic data were 
 sampled at 1,000  hz to align with the kinematic data . the kinematic data measured between 
 event1 and event2 of each subjects were evenly divided into 101 frames ( 0 to 100 frames ) and 
 normalized to each subject s height and weight values . each subject s spt movements were 
 measured five times and the average was used in the analysis . statistical analysis was conducted using pasw ver . 18.0 ( spss , ibm , usa ) . the paired t - test 
 was used to compare kinetic and kinematic data between the two heights of the th and lh . the group means ( standard deviation ) of age , height , weight of the participants were 21.11

 trunk at different heights of the th and the lh in spt movements to provide reference data 
 for effective and safe transfer methods for spinal cord injury , paraplegia , and lower 
 extremity amputation patients . reported that during transfer to seats of 
 different heights , trunk flexion of 6871 appeared at the initial hip lifting , that trunk 
 flexion facilitated spt movements during which the hip was lifted and moved , and that trunk 
 flexion affected balance and stability in spinal cord injury patients with weakened erector 
 spinae muscle or neurological disorders with upper extremity muscle strength8 . advised that the degree of 
 trunk flexion increased the time of hip lifting for the entire spt movement14 . finley noted that patients who complained 
 of shoulder impingement showed smaller trunk flexion angles , and that smaller angles were 
 associated with the formation of small trunk flexion moments at the beginning of the initial 
 phase of hip lifting after injury6 . in the 
 present study , when the hand height was in the lower position ( 40  cm ) , trunk flexion 
 essentially increased to use the lower hand position as the weight - bearing surface . positive 
 effects could be expected from this in that trunk flexion generally acts as propulsion 
 during hip lifting at the beginning of transfer movements . another movement that indispensably appears along with trunk flexion in spt movements is 
 rotation . trunk rotation occurs in the opposite direction to the seat that would move around 
 the th . according to a study conducted by forslund et al.15 , trunk rotation of 41 can occur at the maximum in females , and 32 
 can occur at the maximum in males . the difference was assumed to be attributable to 
 differences in shoulder widths and pelvis sizes between the genders . in the present study , rotation was shown to be smaller by 17.73 on average when the hand height was lower . this 
 is assumed to be associated with the increase in trunk flexion appearing when the hand 
 height is low . in addition , increases in trunk rotation are thought to affect shoulder joint 
 angles and the strength of the surrounding muscles directly . in previous spt movement analysis studies , maximum shoulder joint flexion was 36 , 
 abduction was 50 , and internal rotation was 15306 , 
 16 , 17 . it is known that during transfer movements , complicated upper 
 extremity movement combinations reduce the subacromial space and eventually affect the 
 rotator - cuff muscle and soft tissues ( e.g. bursae ) around the shoulder joint resulting in 
 shoulder impingement . the angles of flexion and abduction at low hand positions in the 
 present study were different from those reported by previous studies . flexion should 
 increase when the bearing surface is low , and larger flexion and abduction angles should 
 occurs to compensate for the bent trunk ( fig . : 
 trunk flexion angle at hn ,  : trunk flexion angle at hl ) . : 
 trunk flexion angle at hn ,  : trunk flexion angle at hl since trunk rotation movements occur around the axis of the th at the beginning , of spt 
 movements , internal rotation of the th shoulder is inevitable . in a study conducted by 
 finely et al . , patients with shoulder impingement were identified as utilizing more internal 
 rotation than other patients during spt movements6 . also , a study conducted by riek et al . reported that internal 
 rotation of 49 occurred at the th of spinal cord injury patients . in the present study , internal rotation at the th occurred more frequently when the hand was low , and this seems 
 to increase the risk of shoulder impingement17 . however , gagnon et al.8 advised that the maximum angle of internal rotation might vary with 
 hand position when spt movements began . therefore , this problem might be resolved by studies 
 seeking the hand position that can minimize internal rotation of the shoulder . forslund et al.15 reported that when sci 
 patients transferred to a seat that was 7  cm higher , the maximum vertical reaction force at 
 the th was always higher than that at the lh , and that this seemed to be a natural 
 phenomenon because the th is closer to the body to initiate movements at the beginning of 
 the movement . they reported that the average vertical reaction force at the th was 32% ( bw ) , 
 and that it was 24.5% ( bw ) at the lh . in a study conducted by gagnon et al.18 , the values were 44.5% ( bw ) at the th and 
 39.6% ( bw ) at the lh , similar to the values of the present study , 43.2% ( bw ) at the th and 
 41.3% ( bw ) at the lh . advised that the maximum vertical reaction force was 
 different between male and female spinal cord injury patients because in the case of males , 
 force was delivered from the th to the lh while in the case of females , force was exerted on 
 both hands almost simultaneously because males were stronger than females18 . in the present study , since all of the 
 subjects were males , the subjects exerted more force at the th when they transferred and a 
 relatively smaller vertical reaction force was observed at the lh . when the hand positions 
 were low , the movement accordingly began with the trunk more bent , and this seems to have 
 acted as a dynamic advantage for vertical reaction force in the phase of hip lifting during 
 transfer movements . with regard to the shearing force ( anterior / posterior , medial / lateral ) measured at the 
 force plates , the anterior shearing force was found to be higher when the hand position was 
 lower than the seat position , and the lateral shear force was found to be higher when the 
 hand height was the same as the height of the seat . when the hand position is low , greater 
 movement to bend the trunk forward occurs . in reaction to the forward bending of the trunk , 
 relatively more anterior and relatively smaller lateral forces act . this is associated with 
 the destabilizing force that decreases when the hand height decreases due to the com 
 becoming farther from the bos as the hand height decreases . duclos et al.11 advised that if the destabilizing force is 
 large , the movement of the center of pressure ( cop ) to the outside of the bos would become 
 more difficult , and that if the com is high , the destabilizing force would be reduced 
 allowing movements to be made with a smaller force . given that when the hand is lower , the 
 vertical reaction forces at the th and the lh as well as the lateral force are smaller , it 
 is our opinion that when the bearing surface for the arm is lower , transfer movements can be 
 made with smaller force , and , in particular , the vertical loads and lateral loads on the 
 shoulder joint can be reduced . limitations of the present study include the fact that the experiment was not conducted 
 with spinal cord injury patients with shoulder pain , and that data were not obtained through 
 measurements in actual transfer environments , but were obtained in a laboratory setting . furthermore , since the experiment was conducted with only healthy male , the results can not 
 be generalized to both sexes , and even though the subjects were educated not to use their 
 lower extremity , they might not have been able to control their lower extremities as 
 completely as actual patients . taken together , our results indicate that as the hand position becomes lower , trunk flexion 
 increases . this would act as a dynamic advantage ( propulsion ) for the movement to lift the 
 hip , thereby reducing the vertical reaction force and shear force acting on the shoulder 
 joint , thereby reducing the load on the shoulder joint . through the present study , the position of the supporting arms during spt movements lower 
 than the seat position was identified to have biomechanical advantages over the position of 
 the supporting arms at the same height as the seat position . the results of the present 
 study can be applied as guidelines for effective and safe methods for quadriplegia or spinal 
 cord injury patients spt , and can be utilized as reference data when considering the 
 appropriate heights of aids for wheelchairs .","[ purpose ] the purpose of this study was to compare the changes in trunk and shoulder 
 angles , and reaction forces under the two hands elicited by different hand base of support 
 positions during sitting pivot transfer . 
 [ subjects and methods ] eighteen unimpaired 
 subjects performed independent sitting pivot transfer . 
 subjects performed sitting pivot 
 transfer between an initial seat to a target seat by only using their hands positioned at 
 the same height as and lower than the seat position . trunk and shoulder kinematics , and 
 reaction forces on the trailing and 
 leading hands were calculated . mean 
 peak joint angles 
 and forces were compared between the hand positions using the pared t - test for the lift 
 phase of the transfer . 
 [ results ] there were significant increases in the trunk angles of 
 forward and lateral flexion , even though rotation decreased while transferring in the 
 lower hand position . increased shoulder flexion , anterior / posterior forces and reduced 
 lateral forces were also shown . 
 [ conclusion ] placing the hands of the supporting arms 
 lower than the seat position during sitting pivot transfer was identified as having 
 biomechanical advantages . 
 therefore , the lower hand position can be recommended as an 
 effective and safe method for sitting pivot transfer by patients with spinal cord injury 
 and can be utilized as a reference data for considering the appropriate height of aids for 
 a wheelchair .",271
"familial hemiplegic migraine ( fhm ) is an autosomal dominant rare type of migraine with aura characterized by some degree of hemiparesis . fhm1 , fhm2 and fhm3 are caused by mutations in the ion - channel genes cacna1a , atp1a2 and scn1a , respectively [ 24 ] . the majority of fhm families have pure fhm , but cerebellar ataxia is frequent in fhm families with mutation in the cacna1a gene [ 5 , 6 ] . we present a norwegian family with a v628  m mutation in the atp1a2 gene ( fig .  1 ) . 1the pedigree , the arrow indicate the proband , squares are men and circles are women , filled symbols are affected , and forward slash indicate deceased the pedigree , the arrow indicate the proband , squares are men and circles are women , filled symbols are affected , and forward slash indicate deceased a 16-year -

old patients and mother had the mutation , while the elder brother was not tested . the phenotype  genotype correlation of the identified mutation ( v628  m ) is strengthened by the fact that it has also been reported in a turkish family . the norwegian family had attacks of pure fhm , with pronounced intra - familial variation in frequency , severity and duration of attacks . physical activity provoked attacks in the affected alive , and mild head trauma provoked attacks in the proband . mutations in the atp1a2 gene usually cause pure fhm , but alternating hemiplegia of childhood , benign familial infantile convulsions , cerebellar symptoms , severe episodic neurological deficits and mental retardation have also been reported [ 818 ] . the hypovolemia caused by dehydration and arterial hypotension probably added to sustain the prolonged fhm attack , but these factors alone has not previously been sufficient to cause a generalized tonic the seizure is most likely caused by nimodipine , as the proband and his mother both noticed worsening of the aura symptoms after initiation of the intravenous nimodipine infusion . nimodipine is a calcium - channel blocker that dilates cerebral vessels and it is used to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage . in theory nimodipine might prevent the vasospasm of fhm by lowering ca - influx . however , the continuous intravenous infusion of nimodipine probably aggravated the arterial hypotension , a known side effect . this caused additional hypoperfusion and hypoxia in the right hemisphere , which lead to a generalized tonic clonic seizure and a secondary edema as shown on mri and spect ( for details see above ) . we conclude that nimodipine is contraindicated in the management of prolonged fhm attack , and recommend conservative management except from supplement of sufficient intravenous fluid in nauseated patients in order to avoid hypovolemia .","we present a norwegian family with familial hemiplegic migraine ( fhm ) with possibly four affected in three generations . 
 the family had a point mutation in the atp1a2 gene that caused a change of the amino acid valine to methionine ( v628  m ) . 
 the symptoms were pure fhm with intra- and interindividual variability , and epilepsy is not part of the clinical picture . 
 attacks could be provoked by physical activity . 
 the proband had prolonged attacks of fhm , and was hospitalized due to such an attack provoked by a minor head trauma . 
 the initial management was conservative , but due to persistence of the hemiplegia on day  9 , a continuous nimodipine infusion was initiated in order to prevent cerebrovascular vasospasm . 
 however , the nimodipine infusion worsened the patient s symptoms and possibly provoked a generalized tonic 
 clonic seizure due to vasodilatation and reduced cerebral blood flow . 
 the mri showed cortical edema and the spect showed reduced perfusion on the contralateral side of the hemiplegia . 
 we conclude that nimodipine is contraindicated in the management of prolonged fhm attacks , and recommend conservative management and supplement of sufficient intravenous fluid in nauseated patients in order to avoid hypovolemia .",272
"despite the availability of a large number of therapeutic agents for the management of type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) , patients continue to present with high levels of glycated hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) in actual clinical practice . insulin is the most potent therapy for t2d ; however , physicians often take a conservative approach to insulin dose optimization citing lack of familiarity and the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain as some of the main concerns associated with its use . it is acknowledged that insulin therapy tailored towards the requirements of individual patients would be more effective in helping patients manage hyperglycemia , while mitigating the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain . a study by riddle et al . suggests that basal ( fasting ) glucose , rather than postprandial plasma glucose ( pppg ) , tends to contribute more towards overall hyperglycemia at higher hba1c levels in t2d patients . basal insulin therapy could therefore help decrease hyperglycemia in t2d patients by providing additional glycemic control . insulin detemir ( idet ) is a basal insulin analogue with a protracted duration of action compared to neutral protamine hagedorn ( nph ) insulin . idet remains soluble in the subcutaneous depot following injection , which may contribute to its lower within - subject variability with regard to nph insulin and another basal analogue , insulin glargine ( iglar ) . studies have found that idet provides hba1c reductions in t2d patients comparable to those provided by iglar and nph insulin . idet therapy is also associated with significantly less weight gain compared to iglar and nph insulin in t2d management . it has also been noted that glycemic control improved following idet therapy in t2d patients previously treated with other basal insulins in combination with oral glucose - lowering drugs ( oglds ) . in india , the t2d epidemic is widespread with a reported diabetes prevalence of 9.0% in 2011 . by 2030 , the diabetes prevalence is set to increase to 10.6% , marking the urgent need to improve t2d management in the country . in developing nations such as india where diabetic complications are common and a large segment of the population is of working age , the high t2d prevalence can have serious economic implications as well . evidence from randomized controlled trials however , the patient populations of these trials are selected based on restrictive criteria and may not be truly representative of the patients seen in actual clinical practice . large observational studies such as a1chieve , on the other hand , can provide relevant and timely data that would help in gauging patient responses to different therapies in a heterogeneous setting . this sub - analysis of the a1chieve study aimed to determine the clinical safety and effectiveness of insulin detemir in indian patients switched from previous nph insulin or iglar therapy . in the open - label , 24-week , non -

vas was 56.2  10.9 points at baseline compared to 72.4  10.5 points at week 24 . in the neu group , the mean qol score was 56.6  6.7 points at baseline and 73.8  9.9 points at week 24 . a total of 102 patients switched therapy from pre - study iglar to idet ( gla group ) , while 39 patients switched from pre - study nph insulin to idet ( neu group ) . demographic and baseline characteristics of the gla and neu groups are presented in table 1 . demographic and baseline characteristics by pre - study basal insulin regimen at baseline , the most commonly used oglds were metformin and sulfonylureas in both groups [ table 1 ] . the three most common reasons reported by physicians for therapy change were to improve glycemic control ( for 96.1% of patients ) , reduce the risk of hypoglycemia ( 42.2% of patients ) and improve weight control ( 32.4% of patients ) in the gla group . in the neu group , the most common reasons for therapy change were to improve glycemic control ( 97.4% of patients ) , reduce the risk of hypoglycemia ( 51.3% of patients ) and try a new insulin ( 25.6% of patients ) . insulin dose and dosing frequency details are presented in table 2 . insulin dose and frequency by pre - study basal insulin regimen the mean pre - study iglar dose was 0.26  0.13 u / kg , and 84.3% of patients followed qd dosing . the mean idet dose was 0.23  0.09 u / kg at baseline and 0.25  0.12 u / kg at week 24 . at baseline , 87.3% of patients dosed idet qd , while at week 24 , 62.7% and 37.3% of patients followed qd and bid dosing , respectively . the mean pre - study nph insulin dose was 0.27  0.16 iu / kg , and 64.1% and 35.9% of patients followed qd and bid dosing , respectively . at baseline and week 24 , the mean idet dose was 0.24  0.09 u / kg and 0.28  0.09 u / kg , respectively . while 87.2% of patients followed qd dosing at baseline , 67.7% and 32.3% of patients followed qd and bid dosing , respectively , at week 24 . there were no sadrs , saes , or major hypoglycemic events reported in either group throughout the study . in the gla group , 11.8% of patients reported overall hypoglycemia at baseline compared to 7.5% at week 24 [ table 3 ] . the corresponding incidence rates of overall hypoglycemia were 2.80 events per patient - year and 1.36 events per patient - year , respectively . no nocturnal hypoglycemic events were reported at week 24 in the gla group [ table 3 ] . outcomes for hypoglycemia by pre - study basal insulin regimen at baseline in the neu group , 10.3% of patients reported overall hypoglycemia , corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.33 events per patient - year [ table 3 ] . at week 24 , no hypoglycemic event of any category was reported in the neu group . in the gla group , the mean  sd hba1c was 9.9  1.8% at baseline compared to 7.6  0.9% at week 24 ( mean change : 2.3  1.7% ) . in the neu group , the mean hba1c level was 9.1  1.2% at baseline and 7.3  0.7% at week 24 ( mean change : 1.7  0.9% ) . fifteen patients had hba1c levels of < 7.0% at week 24 in the gla group compared to 3 patients at baseline . in the neu group , 6 patients had hba1c levels of < 7.0% at week 24 compared to 1 patient at baseline . the mean fpg and pppg levels also appeared to improve from baseline to week 24 in the gla and neu groups [ table 4 ] . the mean levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , and ldl cholesterol appeared to improve over 24 weeks in the gla and neu groups , while the mean hdl cholesterol levels appeared unchanged in both groups [ table 5 ] . outcomes for lipid profile , body weight and sbp by pre - study basal insulin regimen in the gla group , the mean body weight was 72.1  11.7 kg at baseline and 72.3  11.3 kg at week 24 [ table 5 ] . over the same period in the neu group , the mean body weight was 69.5  13.0 kg and 69.8  12.4 kg , respectively . at baseline and week 24 , the mean sbp was 131.6  13.8 mmhg and 128.5  15.7 mmhg , respectively , in the gla group , and 140.5  16.0 mmhg and 132.8  12.2 mmhg , respectively , in the neu group [ table 5 ] . in the gla group , the mean qol score on the eq - vas was 56.2  10.9 points at baseline compared to 72.4  10.5 points at week 24 . in the neu group , the mean qol score was 56.6  6.7 points at baseline and 73.8  9.9 points at week 24 . this sub - analysis demonstrated the clinical safety and effectiveness of idet therapy in indian patients with t2d switched from iglar and nph insulin . as observed in the overall a1chieve study , idet therapy appeared to be associated with beneficial effects on glycemic parameters and hypoglycemia . glycemic control was sub - optimal at baseline in patients previously treated with iglar and nph insulin . in the gla group , patients had a mean baseline hba1c of 9.9  1.8% , diabetes duration of 9.0  5.7 years and had been taking insulin for an average of 2.6  2.0 years . in the neu group , the mean baseline hba1c level was 9.1  1.2% , diabetes duration was 8.9  6.3 years and patients had been on insulin therapy for an average of 2.5  2.9 years . switching to idet therapy was seen to be well - tolerated in the gla and neu groups with no sadrs , saes , or major hypoglycemic events reported during the study . clinical trials have not identified any difference between idet and iglar with regard to the risk of hypoglycemia . in this sub - analysis , the incidence rate of overall hypoglycemia was 2.80 events per patient - year at baseline and 1.36 events per patient - year at week 24 in the gla group . no nocturnal hypoglycemic events were reported at week 24 in the gla group against an incidence rate of 1.91 events per patient - year at baseline . idet has been noted to have a significantly lower risk association for hypoglycemia than nph insulin in 2 randomized controlled trials in patients with t2d . in the neu group in this study , no events of hypoglycemia were reported at week 24 against a baseline incidence rate of 2.33 events per patient - year . glycemic parameters appeared to improve after 24 weeks in both the gla and neu groups . at week 24 , the mean hba1c was 7.6  0.9% in the gla group and 7.3  0.7% in the neu group . however , these levels still fall short of the internationally recommended hba1c target of < 7.0% . also , the number of patients meeting the hba1c target of < 7.0% at week 24 was low in both groups . most patients ( > 60% ) in both the gla and neu groups followed qd dosing of idet at week 24 , with the remaining patients following bid dosing . in the gla group , the mean daily insulin dose by weight was 0.23  0.09 u / kg at baseline and 0.25  0.12 u / kg at week 24 . in the neu group also , the difference in mean dose between baseline and week 24 was small ( 0.24  0.09 and 0.28  0.09 , respectively ) , suggesting that perhaps the physicians were overly cautious in applying dose titration . it is possible that a more aggressive approach to dose titration may have led to more effective reductions in glycemic levels and more patients achieving the recommended hba1c target at week 24 . a general lack of insulin dose optimization in clinical practice in india has also been identified in the prospective 26-week impact study , which evaluated the effectiveness of the indian insulin guideline on premixed insulin . mean body weights remained very similar from baseline to week 24 in both the gla and neu groups , in line with the known weight - sparing effect of idet therapy . the mean qol also appeared to improve with idet therapy in both groups , in line with the overall a1chieve study results that showed a significant improvement in qol in patients treated with idet . this study may have been limited by the lack of a control group and the possible introduction of recall bias in the reporting of safety data , particularly hypoglycemic events . the small number of patients in this sub - analysis was also a limiting factor . concomitant medication and diet were not restricted ; hence , it was not possible to determine the effect , if any , of non - pharmacological treatment on the study outcomes . the heterogeneity of the local healthcare systems meant that there was no standardization across sites . however , this study provided the opportunity to study the effect of switching therapy from nph insulin and iglar to idet in the routine clinical setting in india . all measurements made by the laboratories followed local standardization procedures and the 24-week duration of the study was considered adequate to determine the preliminary clinical trend following therapy change . data from non - interventional studies such as a1chieve can help bridge the gap between recommended healthcare policies for t2d and actual clinical practice . also , patient education can play a key role in improving compliance to blood glucose monitoring , weight control , diet and exercise . a holistic approach to the treatment of t2d , involving increased patient education , recommendations for diet and exercise and therapeutic strategies that target glycemic levels without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain , may be indicated to improve patient compliance and facilitate disease management . in this sub - analysis , idet therapy was noted to be well - tolerated with minimal change in weight and a low risk of hypoglycemia in patients switched from nph insulin and iglar . it would be interesting to note the effect of additional dose titration with idet over a further period of evaluation in a larger patient group .","aim : to explore the clinical safety and effectiveness of insulin detemir ( idet ) in a subgroup of indian patients with type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) switched from either insulin glargine ( iglar ) or neutral protamine hagedorn ( nph ) insulin in the 24-week , non - interventional a1chieve study.materials and methods : indian patients with t2d switching from pre - study iglaror nph insulin to idet were included . 
 safety and effectiveness outcomes were evaluated by the physicians in local clinical settings.results:a total of 102 patients switched from iglar to idet ( gla group ) and 39 patients switched from nph insulin to idet ( neu group ) . at baseline , 
 the mean glycated hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) levels were 9.9  1.8% in the gla group and 9.1  1.2% in the neu group . 
 no serious adverse drug reactions , serious adverse events , or major hypoglycemic events were reported in either group throughout the study . at baseline and week 24 , 11.8% and 7.5% of patients , respectively , reported overall hypoglycemic events in the gla group . 
 no hypoglycemic events were reported at week 24 in the neu group . at week 24 , the mean hba1c levels were 7.6  0.9% in the gla group and 7.3  0.7% in the neu group . 
 the mean fasting plasma glucose , postprandial plasma glucose and quality of life also appeared to improve over 24 weeks.conclusion:switching to idet therapy from iglar and nph insulin was well - tolerated and appeared to be associated with improved glycogenic control in indian patients .",379
"the preeruptive migration of a tooth across the midline is termed as  transmigration . initially , the term transmigration was used only if the entire length of the impacted canine had migrated and crossed the midline of the mandible . however , javid modified the definition by suggesting that one half or more of the length of the tooth was required to cross the midline in order to be considered as transmigration [ 2 , 3 ] . joshi suggested that rather than the distance of migration , the tendency of a canine to cross the barrier of the midline suture was more important . though a number of factors have been proposed , the aetiology and exact process of transmigration are indeterminate . the prevalence of transmigration in different populations and ethnic groups was the subject of several studies and was reported to be between 0.1 and 0.34% [ 57 ] . in india only one study has been conducted on transmigrated mandibular canines . to the best of our knowledge , the present study is the first to report the prevalence of both transmigrated maxillary and mandibular canine in india . in the current study , we determine the prevalence of transmigrant maxillary and mandibular canines in a north indian population and describe the clinical and radiographic features of patients with transmigrant impacted canines . a prospective study of 3000 panoramic radiographs ( 1695 males and 1305 females ) was conducted in two dental colleges in haryana for 8 months from september 2013 to april 2014 . the radiographs of completely edentulous patients and paediatric patients below the age of 10 years were excluded . the radiographs were screened for transmigrant canines by a single examiner experienced in dentomaxillofacial radiology . the examiner in the study was blinded to patient data during the radiographic examination procedure . an impacted canine was considered transmigrated when the tip of the crown of the canine regardless of its length had crossed the midline . the panoramic radiographs were screened for radiographically identified position of the transmigrated tooth , retained canine , associated pathologies , and other coexisting dental anomalies ( other than third molar ) . each image 's contrast and brightness were optimized to produce the best image for viewing under standardized conditions . after diagnosing a transmigrant canine radiographically , clinical evaluation was done for the patient 's age and sex , symptoms , the presence of associated pathology , and the treatment provided . as diagnosis of transmigrated canine is an objective assessment and these teeth are clearly visible there was no requirement for an interexaminer validity . statistical analysis was done using spss version 11 and the chi - square test was done . canine positioned mesioangularly across the midline , labial or lingual to the anterior teeth . canine positioned mesioangularly across the midline , labial or lingual to the anterior teeth . canine horizontally impacted near the inferior border of the mandible inferior to the apices of the incisor teeth . canine horizontally impacted near the inferior border of the mandible inferior to the apices of the incisor teeth . canine horizontally impacted near the inferior border of the mandible below the apices of posterior teeth . canine horizontally impacted near the inferior border of the mandible below the apices of posterior teeth . canine positioned vertically in the midline with the long axis of the tooth crossing the midline . canine positioned vertically in the midline with the long axis of the tooth crossing the midline . the relationship ( position / angulation ) of maxillary transmigrant canine with median palatine suture and the distance travelled in contralateral arch past midline suture by transmigrated canine along its long axis was also evaluated . the maxillary transmigrated canine was approximated into three parts along its long axis as tip of crown till approximate halfway of crown , halfway of crown till cement - enamel junction ( cej ) , and lastly beyond cej irrespective of root length of transmigrated canine ( figure 7 ) . there were 20 patients ( 12 males and 8 females ) observed in our study with transmigrated canines . the mean age of patients with transmigrated canines was found to be 24.1 years ( age range 1550 years ) . the prevalence of mandibular canine transmigration was 0.5% ( 15/3000 ) whereas the prevalence of 0.16% ( 5/3000 ) was recorded for the maxillary canine transmigration ( p < 0.05 ) ( figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) . there was no statistically significant difference for gender with 12 transmigrant mandibular canines in males ( 0.7% ) as compared to 8 subjects with transmigrant canines ( 0.61% ) . left - side predominance was observed for mandibular canine transmigration with 11 patients observing left mandibular canine migrating towards right side and four cases migrating from the right side towards left side ( p < 0.5 ) . a similar finding was observed in maxillary canine transmigration with 3 cases depicting a left maxillary canine migration as compared to two cases depicting right side transmigration . there was presence of the retained primary canine with respect to transmigrated canine in seven cases ( 35.0% ) . the presence of other dental anomalies was present in 45% cases of transmigration ( p > 0.05 ) . applying mupparapu 's classification for mandibular canine transmigration ( 15 cases ) , type 1 transmigration was the commonest type found in our study ( 10 cases ) , followed by types 2 and 4 ( 2 cases each ) and 1 case of type 5 transmigration . no type 3 transmigration case was found in the study . 2 cases ( 10.0% ) of transmigrated canines only the tip of crown till approximate half of crown positioned in the median palatine suture was observed in 60% cases of transmigrant maxillary canines ( figure 7 ) . four maxillary transmigrant canines were positioned in a horizontal or perpendicular direction ( 8090 ) to median palatine suture as compared to single case with mesioangular impaction ( table 3 ) . in the present study , the prevalence of maxillary and mandibular canine transmigrated canines was evaluated which is in contrast to the only previous indian study related to transmigrated teeth , that focussed only on mandibular canines . transmigration , intraosseous migration of unerupted tooth , is a rare phenomenon [ 5 , 6 ] . early diagnosis with a timely orthodontic or surgical intervention can help dentists preserve the canines , which play an important role , in both aesthetics and function in the human dentition . the research on prevalence of transmigrated canines has been scarce with only a handful of studies conducted on this rare phenomenon ( table 4 ) [ 516 ] . in accordance with the previous studies , a greater predilection of mandibular canine transmigration ( 0.5% ) was observed in our study as compared to maxillary canine transmigration ( 0.16% ) . aktan et al . had observed a similar predilection of  0.14% for maxillary transmigrated canines and found a prevalence of 0.34% for transmigrated mandibular canines , while gunduz found a 0.1% prevalence of transmigrated canines in 12,000 patients [ 6 , 7 ] . the prevalence of transmigrated maxillary canine ( 0.16% ) found in our study was found to be similar to all the studies , though a greater prevalence of 0.44% was documented in one study . the prevalence of transmigrated mandibular canine was , however , found to be variable ranging from 0.004% by mupparapu   to 0.46% by kumar et al . however , the overall prevalence of transmigration of 0.66% was found to be slightly higher than the other studies . zvolanek 's case series failed to find any transmigrant canines in 4000 individuals   whereas javid had identified one transmigrant canine after examining 1,000 panoramic radiographs . the difference in prevalence can be attributed not only to ethnic differences but also to type of the study population whether it is orthodontic or general population . similar to the findings reported by aydin et al . , we also found that transmigrant canines occur more frequently in male patients ( 60% ) than in female patients ( 40% ) . gonzlez - snchez et al . who found a greater prevalence of transmigrated canines in females [ 15 , 18 ] . in an extensive review by sumer et al . they had postulated a slight female predilection ( 1.6  :  1 ) . aras et al . had , however , observed no gender predilection in their study of 6000 patients . the reason for the gender predilection is not clear , though females typically tend to report frequently for aesthetics as compared to males . in our study there was a marginally increased number of males ( 1695 males ; 1305 females ) that possibly could have resulted in greater number of transmigrated canines being observed in males , though no statistically significant difference was found ( p > 0.05 ) . the reported patient age at presentation of the transmigrant canine varies from 8 years to 69 years . in our study the average age the mean age for maxillary transmigrant canines ( 32 years ) was found to be much higher as compared to transmigrant mandibular canine ( 21.5 years ) . this increased mean age could be attributed to a greater path travelled as well as median palatine barrier that has to be crossed by maxillary canine to transmigrate as compared to relatively easier path for mandibular canine . nevertheless , this finding could be coincidental and more studies regarding transmigrant maxillary canine can prove that whether transmigrant maxillary canine is likely to be encountered in a slightly higher age group as compared to mandibular canine . moreover , the lack of previous radiographic records further makes this finding difficult to ascertain . canine transmigration involved a left - side tooth more often ( 14/20 cases ; 70% ) than the right canine ( 6/20 ; 30% ) . this finding was in accordance with the findings observed by kumar from south india , celikoglu from turkey , and mazinis in greece [ 8 , 13 , 16 ] . however aydin et al . and aras et al . had not found any side predilection in their study [ 10 , 12 ] . in the 28 cases documented by joshi , though no prevalence was reported , 53.6% were left - side teeth , 32.1% were right - side ones , and 14.6% were bilateral cases . bilateral canine transmigrations are rare and very few case reports have been documented in literature [ 2024 ] . was the first to report the bilateral occurrence of transmigrated canines and later mupparapu et al . all documented bilateral transmigrant canine cases have involved mandibular canines except a single reported case of bilateral maxillary transmigrated canines in study conducted by aktan et al . the findings in the current study did not reveal any case of bilateral transmigration . despite the first case of transmigration reported by caldwell in 1955 , a possible etiological factor of transmigration postulated was retention or premature loss of deciduous teeth . 35% of the cases in our study had retained primary canine with respect to the transmigrated tooth . other factors postulated were crowding , spacing , supernumerary teeth , unfavourable alveolar arch length , fractures with displacement of tooth bud , and an excessive crown length of the permanent canine [ 9 , 18 ] . crowding of the mandibular incisors was present in only one case ( 5.0% ) in our study . joshi had stated that the presence of cyst , tumor , or odontoma may facilitate transmigration of the canine . in the current study , . evaluated that impacted transmigrant canines were not associated with any pathology in 6,000 patients . bruzst suggested that the canine tooth bud is situated in front of the lower incisors and that facial growth pushes the canine towards the contralateral side . the future studies of transmigration should focus also on the patient 's siblings and parents for the possible hereditary pattern . pippi and kaitsas had postulated a pericoronal osteolytic area , because of an anomalous secretion of signal molecules either due to genetic origin or inflammatory stimuli . therefore , a symmetrical pericoronal enlargement takes place that represents a  locus minoris resistentiae ,  towards which the impacted canine moves . this movement stops when the tooth finds a mechanical obstacle ( e.g. , jaw cortical bone ) . vichi and franchi had suggested that agenesis of the adjacent teeth , in particular , the lateral incisor , may favour retention of the primary canine , and the excess of space in the dental arch may account for the absence of a correct guide for eruption . though there were 2 concurrent cases of agenesis of maxillary lateral incisors and one case of congenitally missing maxillary canine with mandibular canine transmigration , none of these cases were sufficient to warrant a statistical analysis . the authors correlated the association of transmigration with other dental anomalies ( other than third molars ) but could not find any significant finding . the rarity of transmigrant canines in our study and other published studies in literature makes the correlation studies difficult . the reason why an impacted canine transmigrates might be due to concoction of all the above factors that could possibly lead to varying presentations of particular transmigrant tooth . the likely reasons for a greater number of mandibular transmigrant cases are voluminous mandibular symphysis and an emphasised buccal inclination of the lower incisors , as well as the typical conic shape of the canine root and crown . transmigration of an impacted maxillary canine is rare due to the negligible distance between the apexes of the maxillary incisors and the floor of the nasal fossae and to the presence of the midpalatal suture , which is a considerable barrier against maxillary canine migration . in three cases ( 60% ) , tip of crown till less than halfway of crown of transmigrant maxillary canines was positioned in the median palatine suture whereas in 40% of the cases more than half of crown ( till cementoenamel junction ) of transmigrant maxillary canine was observed to cross the median palatine barrier . the above result is in agreement with other studies where crown of transmigrant maxillary canines could traverse only till cement - enamel junction beyond median palatine suture and no case has yet been reported where a maxillary canine has completely crossed into the contralateral arch [ 6 , 11 , 16 ] . currently it is not known how much eruptive force is required but the transmigrant maxillary canine might be having a greater amount of horizontal component of eruptive force to penetrate the resistance of dense median palatine suture . the type of the angulation formed between the midsagittal plane and unerupted canine decides the course of transmigration . it has been suggested that when the angle exceeds 50 , mandibular canines are likely to migrate and cross the midline . however if the angulation is less than 30 , transmigration is unlikely . though radiographic technique dictates the appearance of radiographic position of transmigrated maxillary canine , a horizontal position ( 8090 ) of transmigrant maxillary canine was observed in four cases , whereas mesioangular position ( 45 ) was observed in one case . shapira and kuftinec had suggested that the migrating maxillary canine probably tunnels through the bone as median palatine suture typically remains intact radiographically in all previously documented cases . thus a higher angulation ( approximately 80 ) as compared to mandibular canine might be required for an impacted maxillary canine to overcome strong anatomical barrier of median palatine suture and hence a horizontal position is more likely to transmigrate as compared to a mesioangular position . however more studies are required to corroborate the above finding of angulation and position making a difference in penetration of suture as there is still paucity of reported cases of maxillary transmigrant canines . according to mupparapu the most likely position of the transmigrant mandibular canine is mesioangular impaction ( type 1 ) and the erupted transmigrant canines especially in vertical position in midline are the rarest ( type 5 ) . in our study , type 1 transmigration was the pattern most frequently encountered in accordance with the previous studies . these findings were similar to the studies conducted by kumar et al , mazinis et al . [ 6 , 8 , 16 ] the type 3 canine transmigration appears to be the rarest form of mandibular transmigration rather than type 5 after reviewing all the published studies on transmigration . the classification by mupparapu ( 2002 ) could not be used for maxillary transmigrated teeth , though there was mild variation in the patterns of transmigrated maxillary canines in position and angulation . the transmigrated canines are mostly asymptomatic , though , rarely complications like follicular space enlargement , chronic infection with fistula , pain due to impingement , resorption of adjacent teeth , and swelling as well as ectopic eruption could occur . in our study we observed two cases ( 10.5% ) of transmigrant canine with follicular space enlargement . none of the patients in the present study were symptomatic and no root resorption was evident in adjoining teeth of the transmigrant canines . mazinis et al . had however observed a single case of root resorption in lateral incisor and had postulated usage of cone beam computed tomography ( cbct ) for accurate localisation and assessing the root resorption . proposed treatment strategies for transmigrated mandibular canines include surgical removal , transplantation , and surgical exposure with orthodontic alignment . the most preferred treatment for migrated canines is surgical extraction [ 8 , 18 ] . this is especially true when the mandibular arch is crowded and requires therapeutic extractions to correct the incisor crowding . it is however imperative to anesthetise the nerve on the originating side as transmigrated teeth maintain their nerve connection to the originating side where the tooth germ is formed . if the mandibular incisors are in normal position with sufficient space for transmigrated canine , then transplantation can be undertaken . wertz stated that if the crown of a transmigrated tooth migrates past the opposite incisor area , or if the apex migrates past the apex of the adjacent lateral incisor , it might be mechanically impossible to bring it into place . had suggested that when the transmigrated canine is accessible , and especially if it is symptomatic , removal of the impacted tooth is recommended . if asymptomatic , transmigrant canine should be periodically evaluated radiographically and kept under observation . since none of our cases were symptomatic , removal of impacted transmigrated tooth was not considered . all the patients were kept on periodic follow - up and referred for orthodontic treatment with varying management modalities planned like orthodontic traction and surgical exposure with orthodontic treatment . according to the aktan et al . , except for the canine , no tooth type shows a tendency for transmigration in the dental arch . however , kara et al . had observed two transmigrant cases of lateral incisor and three cases of premolar in their study . in our study most of the transmigrant cases are impacted and rarely erupt as was observed in studies conducted by aktan et al . and only one erupted transmigrated canine ( 5.0% ) was observed in our study as compared to 2.2% of erupted transmigrated canines in a study by kara et al . . the prevalence of transmigrant maxillary canine is almost similar ( 0.13%0.20% ) in all the studies conducted on transmigration [ 6 , 10 , 12 ] . the panoramic radiographs must be used for evaluation of impacted canines and the usage of cbct should be implemented in advanced treatment planning as it would provide more precise information about the localisation of transmigrated canine and its relationship to surrounding teeth and median palatine suture . research studies on transmigration should focus not only on the possible complications like root resorption and follicular spaces but also on the distance beyond the midline migrated by the transmigrated teeth as no literature is yet available . further research is required to validate that a horizontally impacted maxillary canine is more likely to transmigrate as compared to mesioangularly impacted maxillary canine . canine transmigration is of vital significance in dentistry as it can create orthodontic , esthetic , surgical , and interceptive complications . hereditary patterns of the transmigration should be further investigated as its etiology is not yet ascertained . type 3 canine is the rarest form of transmigrant mandibular canine and a classification system for maxillary transmigrant canine to aid in the diagnosis and management is long overdue .","aim .

"a 45-year - old male patient was admitted to an outpatient clinic with blunt thoracic trauma after falling from height ( work - related accident ) and was referred to kocaeli university faculty of medicine after the detection of ischemia on his electrocardiogram . in the physical examination , the vital signs were stable , but pain and tenderness was detected on his ribs in the thoracal examination . however , it was worth noting the patient had a history of hypertension . a t inversion was detected in d1 , avl , and v3 , v4 , v5 , v6 derivations in the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) . further , there were no additional pathologic findings in the blood tests and the serological tests echocardiography showed minimal mitral insufficiency and a cystic lesion ( size : 2527 mm ) next to the left ventricle anterolateral wall ( fig . cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) documented a cystic lesion on the lateral wall of the left ventricle , approximately 3.52.5 cm in size ; this lesion was initially considered to be similar to a hydatid cyst ( fig . 1b ) . there were no additional cyst hydatid lesions found in the computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and the thorax . median sternotomy was performed under general anesthesia , and cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated after standard aorta and bicaval cannulation . the cyst was opened up ; cyst fluid was aspirated ; and the remaining contents , including the germinative membrane and the daughter vesicules , were removed ( fig . we paid maximum attention to the prevention of the dissemination of the aspiration fluid to the pericardial sac . the cyst cavity was irrigated with a highly concentrated sodium chloride solution , and then , the empty sac was closed with primary sutures . a therapy with albendazole was initiated immediately with a 10-mg / kg / day dose and maintained for three months . echocardiography and thorax computed tomography ( ct ) were repeated in the outpatient clinic control at 6 months postoperatively and showed no pathological findings . median sternotomy was performed under general anesthesia , and cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated after standard aorta and bicaval cannulation . the cyst was opened up ; cyst fluid was aspirated ; and the remaining contents , including the germinative membrane and the daughter vesicules , were removed ( fig . we paid maximum attention to the prevention of the dissemination of the aspiration fluid to the pericardial sac . the cyst cavity was irrigated with a highly concentrated sodium chloride solution , and then , the empty sac was closed with primary sutures . a therapy with albendazole was initiated immediately with a 10-mg / kg / day dose and maintained for three months . echocardiography and thorax computed tomography ( ct ) were repeated in the outpatient clinic control at 6 months postoperatively and showed no pathological findings . hydatid disease is endemic in farming areas but occurs worldwide . in particular , the incidence is greater in the cattleor sheep - raising areas of the world , such as australia , south america , south africa , and panama , the mediterranean countries , and the middle east . the most common site of the disease is the liver , followed by the lungs , kidney , bones , and brain . . any race can be affected , and this disease is common in both men and women . its symptoms depend on the affected organ ; for example , liver cysts cause jaundice and abdominal discomfort , while lung cysts cause cough , chest pain , and hemoptysis ( coughing up blood ) . hydatid cyst is a human parasitic disease in which multiple - visceral involvement is generally caused by the metacestode of the tapeworm or larva of the species of the genus echinococcus . however , the most frequently involved cardiac region is the left ventricle ; the right ventricle and the interventricular septum are the less affected regions , respectively . the age of the cyst , size of the cyst , and the extent of calcification are decisive for clinical presentation in patients . patients generally present at outpatient clinics with complaints of subjective symptoms such as palpitation , dyspnea , and atypical angina pectoris . diagnosis is performed using imaging techniques , examination of the cyst fluid , and serological tests . a cardiac cyst can lead to life - threatening consequences such as myocardial infarction caused by the compression of a coronary artery , pulmonary edema caused by a disturbance in the valvular mechanisms , or outflow tract obstruction and sudden cardiac arrest caused by a variety of conduction defects . a cardiac cyst is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the variability of signs and symptoms at its presentation , its numerous and often unpredictable preoperative complications , and the risk of complications associated with cardiac surgery . our patient was asymptomatic for years and did not have any complaints associated with hydatid disease before the accident when a cardiac hydatid cyst was diagnosed by the thorax ct . arrhythmia , electrical conduction system defects and bundle branch blocks , myocardial infarction , and non - specific st segment and t - wave changes can be seen in the ecg in the cases of cardiac hydatid cysts . a t inversion was detected in d1 , avl , and v3-v6 in the ecg of our patient ; however , the patient 's coronary angiography was normal . cardiac cyst hydatid involves many septums and occasionally , daughter cysts . because of the thin membrane surrounding the cyst it can be distinguished from other intracardiac masses by echocardiography . a hydatid cyst can be in the form of a solid mass or have a multiloculated cystic formation in some cases . cardiac mri and thoracic ct have been utilized in the diagnosis of hydatid disease . in our case , the cardiac mri revealed normal intensities , sizes , and wall thicknesses of the right ventricle , left atrium , and right atrium . further , a hypodense mass ( size : 3.52.5 cm ) was observed in the t1-weighted sequence ; the t1- and t2-weighted sequences of the cyst rim revealed hypointensity . the most common treatment strategy of echinococcosis is 6 months of medical treatment with albendazole or mebendazole or a combination of albendazole and praziquantel after surgical treatment . we chose surgical excision under cardiopulmonary bypass , and the albendazole treatment was pursued after surgical cyst excision in this patient . the patient is still being followed in the outpatient clinic of infectious diseases . in conclusion , the possibility of cardiac hydatid disease should be kept in mind , particularly in the endemic zones . due to the high risk of their associated complications ,","cardiac involvement in hydatid disease is more seldom than the involvement of the liver and the lungs . 
 cardiac cyst hydatid disease is diagnosed incidentally or by means of symptoms such as dyspnea and angina pectoris . here 
 , we present the case of a 45-year - old male patient who underwent open heart surgery for a randomly detected cardiac cyst hydatid during investigations carried out in a healthcare institution after accidentally falling from height . on the other hand 
 , this patient did not have any complaints associated with hydatid disease before this event .",112
"the quantity of trauma victims and the management involved in attending them leads to a great workload in most hospitals and places an enormous amount of pressure on the health care system . furthermore , traumatic injuries have been reported as the leading cause of death in the first 40 years of life and appear to be on the increase . during the last decade , interpersonal violence ( ipv ) was one of the main etiological factors of fractures of the maxillofacial complex . road traffic accidents remain the most important cause of maxillofacial trauma worldwide , although falls and assaults have become more significant in north america , brazil and europe . blunt and cutting wounds on the head and neck are also common . legal underreporting is common due to associations with alcohol abuse , illicit drug use , firearms and acts of violence against women , children , and the elderly , which generate fear , shame , low self - esteem and a sense of powerlessness . facial fractures associated to ipv have functional , aesthetic and psychological effects on the victims , as well as a socioeconomic impact on the health systems of many countries .these victims are more likely to suffer from depression , anxiety and post - traumatic stress disorder . epidemiological studies help to identify demands , develop prevention programs and structure an integrated care system . the aim of this retrospective study was to compare the peculiarities of maxillofacial injuries caused by interpersonal violence with other etiologic factors . this retrospective study involved data collected from clinical notes and surgical records of patients treated at seven different hospitals located in three different cities in so paulo state , brazil . the sample was selected based on analysis of medical records of facial trauma patients attended by the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery in the piracicaba dental school at the university of campinas from january 1999 to december 2012 . a standardized form was designed to investigate the epidemiologic features of maxillofacial traumas , considering aspects such as age , gender , diagnosis , soft tissue lesions , facial injuries and general injuries . the exclusion criterion was incomplete information about the type of trauma on the medical chart . the origin of the facial trauma was classified as follows : traffic accidents ( automobile and motorcycle ) ; work accidents ; sport accidents ; falls ; interpersonal violence ; cycling accidents ; pedestrian accidents and others . facial injury sites were classified as follows : upper ( frontal bone ) ; middle ( maxilla , nasal bones , zygomatic - orbital complex , naso - orbital ethmoidal ) and lower ( mandible ) . mandibular fractures were described according to the anatomic site : condylar fractures ; angle fractures ; body fractures and fractures of symphysis . the present study was approved by the research ethics committee of piracicaba dental school , state university of campinas ( fop / unicamp ) under protocol number 75/2013 . data were submitted to statistical analysis ( simple descriptive statistics and chi - squared test ) with the support of the statistical package for social sciences ( spss 18.0 for windows , spss inc , chicago , il ) . binary logistic regression and the chi - square test were performed and the results were considered relevant when p < 0.05 . these included absolute frequencies ( raw counts ) and relative frequencies ( proportions or percentages of the total number of observations ) . based on the 13-year study period , 3,724 patient referrals to the maxillofacial surgery department were enrolled in the present study . the median age at the time of admission was 29.2 years , with a standard deviation of 17.06 years . a total of 612 patients ( 16.4% ) exhibited facial injuries related to ipv . in this group , male victims prevailed with 81% ( n = 496 ) and the mean age was 31.28 years , with a standard deviation of 13.33 years . weekly consumption of alcohol was reported by 32.4% and tobacco use was 43.8% . in total , 79 patients ( 12.8% ) reported using non - injecting illicit drugs and 14 ( 2.2% ) stated that they currently used injecting drugs . in 176 cases , isolated alveolar - dental injuries were observed in 35 patients . with regards to maxillofacial fractures , table 2 shows the distribution of diagnoses in the general sample and among patients who were victims of physical assault . distribution of patients with facial injuries according to etiological factors

  in the cases of mandibular fractures , the anatomic regions most affected were the body and the mandibular angle , with 36 cases in each region , followed by the condyle ( 25 cases ) , symphysis ( 9 cases ) and isolated mandibular ramus ( 2 cases ) . in 41 patients , fractures involving more than one anatomic region of the mandible lacerations and abrasions on the face were identified in 181 and 105 patients , respectively . table 3 displays the distribution of body injuries in these patients , when compared to the general sample . distribution of body injuries among patients with facial trauma and patients whose facial injury was associated with interpersonal violence ( ipv )

 n = number of patients ;  = chi - square . 
  a greater number of fractures and lacerations of the face was observed , although with fewer facial abrasions . with regards to the area of bone fractures , fewer injuries occurred in other regions of the body , mainly due to fewer injuries of the upper and lower limbs . however , patients that were associated with ipv exhibited a greater number of injuries to the neurocranium . binary logistic regression was performed to determine whether fractures in facial injuries were affected by gender , age ( median 30 years ) , drug use , the presence of lacerations or the presence of abrasions . fractures were associated with gender : male patients are more at risk than females ( or = 1.61 , p < 0.002 , 95% ci : 1.05 to 2.46 ) . although motor vehicle accidents are still the main cause of maxillofacial fractures in some developing countries , recent data from developed countries have shown that ipv is the dominant cause . ipv is one of the leading causes of maxillofacial fractures and its prevalence in a population varies according to geographic region and appears to be associated with factors such as socioeconomic status , population density and age characteristics . the prevalence of male victims has been reported in most studies , ranging from 61% to 92% , as well as a mean age of approximately 30 years [ 10 - 14 ] . however , children are also affected and several studies have reported the patterns and severity of these injuries . this age group is susceptible to craniofacial trauma due to their greater cranial mass - to - body weight ratio . compared to adults , less 65 patients were under 18 years of age , although most of them ( 36 patients ) were aged between 16 and 18 years . these patients mainly exhibited nasal bone ( 21 patients ) and mandibular fractures ( 12 patients ) , results which are in accordance with the literature . the prevalence of male victims is influenced by cultural models of gender , defined as the set of attributes , values , roles and behavior patterns that are expected from a man in a particular culture . generally , the traits valued in this socialization are aggression , domination and exploitation of danger , which could contribute to their association with ipv . ipv among females is mainly associated with domestic violence . in the present study , it was not possible to determine the pattern of violence suffered . when the victim is female , the case should be investigated regardless of the site of the injury , as there is a greater possibility that they are the victim of physical aggression due to the vulnerability of the gender . another relevant factor is the differences in female participation in social activities , making them more ( or less ) prone to urban violence . patients who were victims of physical assault , unlike other etiologies such as sports accidents , are often affected by problems such as drug use and poverty . in the present study , we found high consumption rates of alcohol , tobacco and non - injecting drugs . its consumption results in an increase in confidence , followed by the subjective feeling of increased mental and physical capacity , as well as impaired judgment and coordination . .   found that alcohol was involved in 87% of maxillofacial fractures caused by ipv , compared with 58% for motor vehicle accidents . studies have reported that fractures of the mandible are the most prevalent , followed by zygomatic complex fractures [ 17 - 19 ] . furthermore , we showed that the prevalence of mandibular and nasal bone fractures was higher in this group of patients . the literature indicates that trauma associated with ipv are less severe than those associated with other etiological factors due to the magnitude and speed of impact . despite this fact , patients in which ipv was the etiologic factor exhibited a higher prevalence of bone fractures when compared to all other patients treated . possibly , some patients with minor injuries do not seek medical care due to shame or fear . a high frequency of soft tissue lesions were found on the face , particularly lacerations . in the literature , the most common orofacial injuries are lip injuries , followed by other soft tissue injuries on the face , gingival and oral mucosa injuries , and teeth and/or periodontal injuries . the pattern of facial fractures is related to the type , direction and force of impact , as well as the anatomical features of the area . ipv injuries are usually caused by punches or kicks , for which the face is the main target region . the face is probably the target for most acts of physical aggression as it is easily reached , due to its location at the same height as the aggressor s raised arm . it has also been suggested that the aggressor either consciously or unconsciously wishes to affect the victim s self - esteem . males appear to be injured by more dangerous mechanisms and are more frequently injured by objects than females . the mandible , which is mobile and prominent on the face , is more susceptible to trauma . in the present study , the region of the mandibular angle has been considered the least resistant , mainly due to the presence of the mandibular third molar . these accidents often cause pan - facial , cranial , orthopedic , abdominal and cervical spine injuries , which may require multidisciplinary input , with significant interventions such as intubation , craniotomy and tracheostomy . conversely , ipv tends to be associated with isolated fractures , particularly in the mandibular region . the present study confirmed that most patients were affected by a fracture in only one region of the face . a lower prevalence of injuries was recorded for other parts of body . although the world health organization considers the response of health - care services to victims of violence to be an international priority , health professionals are generally not qualified to identify the injuries or council victims . the role of health professionals is to identify the etiology of the injury and , in cases of physical aggression , provide the victim with information on where to seek help . moreover , health professionals are not well prepared to ask sensitive questions and are unaware of victim - support institutions . the findings of the present study demonstrated that facial trauma caused by interpersonal violence seem to be associated with a higher rate of facial fractures and lacerations when compared to all other patients with facial injuries . male patients are more likely to exhibit severe injuries and exhibited a greater amount of bone fractures . prominent areas of the face and neurocranium should be carefully examined as they tend to be more prone to injuries . glaucia maria bovi ambrosano , associate professor , department of community dentistry , campinas state university piracicaba dental school , for statistical analysis assistance .","abstractobjectivesthe aim of this retrospective study was to compare the peculiarities of maxillofacial injuries caused by interpersonal violence with other etiologic factors.material and methodsmedical records of 3,724 patients with maxillofacial injuries in so paulo state ( brazil ) were retrospectively analyzed .

"the principal aim of this laboratory is the synthesis of conjugated unsaturated ketones as candidate antineoplastic agents . these compounds interact with thiols but in general , they have little or no affinity for amino and hydroxyl groups which are found in nucleic acids ( 1 - 3 ) . hence thiol alkylators may not have the genotoxic properties associated with a number of contemporary anticancer drugs ( 4 ) . however after an initial chemical insult , certain neoplasms are more vulnerable to a subsequent cytotoxic effect than various non - malignant cells ( 5 , 6 ) . hence by mounting the 1,5-diaryl-3-oxo-1,4-pentadienyl pharmacophore [ ar - c = c - c(o)-c = c - ar ] on heterocyclic and cycloaliphatic scaffolds , two sequential interactions with cellular thiols can take place which may be more detrimental to tumours than normal tissues . such considerations led to the development of 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidones 1a - d which demonstrated potent cytotoxic properties with the ic50 values in the low micromolar range against human molt 4/c8 and cem t - lymphocytes as well as murine l1210 lymphocytic leukemia cells ( 7 , 8) . the hypothesis of sequential cytotoxicity was advanced that the 1,5-diaryl-3-oxo-1,4-pentadienyl group interacts at a primary binding site and a side chain on the piperidine nitrogen may align at an auxiliary binding site which could enhance cytotoxic potencies . in order to evaluate this hypothesis , a novel series of n - aroyl-3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone derivatives 2 - 7 were synthesized ( 8) . in these compounds , the side chain contains atoms and groups capable of forming hydrogen and van der waals bonds and also an ionic bond in series 3 - 6 which could bind at an auxiliary binding site . when the potencies of the compounds in series 3 - 6 were compared with that of the analogs 1a - d which have the same aryl substituent , the ic50 values of the amides 3 - 6 were lower in 48% of the comparisons made while equipotency was noted in 35% of the cases ( 8) . the proposed primary and auxiliary binding sites of cytotoxic n - aroyl-3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone analogs   the objectives of the present investigation are two folds . first , to gain some insight into the physicochemical properties of the 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone derivatives 1 - 7 that influence cytotoxic potencies , and second , to derive predictive 2d - qsar models that will be helpful to design new analogs with improved bioactivity . the in - vitro cytotoxic data used in this study were taken from the literature ( 8) . the reported ic50 values were converted into logarithmic scale ( pic50 ) and then were used for qsar analysis as dependent variables . the data set ( n = 25 ) was divided randomly into two groups : calibration set ( n = 19 ) and prediction set ( n = 6 ) . ( table 1 ) ( asterisk sign in the table demonstrate the prediction set ) . descriptor generation 
  the chemical structure of molecules was constructed using a hyperchem package ( version 7 ; hypercube inc . , gainesville , fl , usa ) and primarily were energetically minimized ( 100 steepest descent steps using mm force field with a gradient convergence value of 0.1 kcal / mol ) using hyperchem software . the z - matrices of the structures were provided by the software and were then transferred to the gaussian 98 program . gaussian 98 was used for semi - empirical molecular orbital calculations ( am1 ) of the structures . a large number of molecular descriptors were calculated using hyperchem , gaussian 98 and dragon packages ( 10 ) . different functional descriptors such as topological , geometrical , and constitutional descriptors were calculated using dragon software . moreover , some chemical parameters including molecular volume ( mv ) , molecular surface area ( sa ) , hydrophobicity ( logp ) , heat of formation and hydration energy ( he ) were calculated using hyperchem software . 
 data processing and modeling 
  the calculated descriptors were collected in a data matrix and generated descriptors were scaled using auto scaling procedure . firstly , the descriptors were checked for constant or near - constant values and those detected were removed from the original data matrix . then the correlation of descriptors with each other s and with the potency data was determined . among the detected collinear descriptors ( r > 0.8 ) , one of them demonstrating the highest correlation with potency was retained , and the rest were omitted . in the model development step , leave - one - out cross - validation was used to optimize the models ( e.g. , selection of variables or no . of principal components ) . the final models were validated using a set of 6 molecules in the test set , which did not contribute to the model development . two different methods were used for the development of qsar equations ( i ) stepwise multiple linear regression ( mlr ) , ( iii ) genetic algorithm  partial least squares ( ga - pls ) . these methods are well documented in the literature ( 11 ) . in stepwise regression , the basic procedures involve ( i ) identifying an initial model , ( ii ) iteratively ' stepping ' , that is , repeatedly altering the model at the previous step by adding or removing a predictor variable in accordance with the ' stepping criteria ' ( in our case , probability of f = 0.05 for inclusion ; probability of f = 0.1 for exclusion for the forward selection method ) , and ( iii ) terminating the search when stepping is no longer possible given the stepping criteria , or when a specified maximum number of steps have been reached . specifically , at each step , all variables are reviewed and evaluated to determine which one will contribute most to the equation . this variable will then be included in the model , and the process starts again . a limitation of the stepwise regression search approach is that it presumes there is a single ' best ' subset of x variables and seeks to identify it . there is often no unique ' best ' subset , and all possible regression models with a similar number of x variables as in the stepwise regression solution should be fitted subsequently to study whether some other subsets of x variables might be better . in the present study , mlr with stepwise selection and elimination of variables the resultant models were validated by a leave - one - out cross - validation procedure ( using matlab software ) to check their predictive power and robustness . a genetic algorithm uses genetic rules such as reproduction , cross - over , and mutation to build pseudo organisms that are then selected , on the basis of a fitness criterion to survive and pass information on to the next generation . to select the most relevant set of descriptors , the evolution of population was simulated ( 12 - 15 ) . pls is a generalization of regression , which can handle data with strongly correlated and  or numerous x variables ( 15 ) . the linear pls model finds ' new variables ' ( latent variables or x scores ) that are a linear combination of the original variables . to avoid over fitting , a strict test for the significance of each consecutive pls component is necessary and then stopping when the components are non - significant . cross - validation is a practical and reliable method of testing this significance ( 14 ) . application of pls thus allows the construction of larger qsar equations while avoiding over fitting and eliminating most variables . pls is normally used in combination with cross - validation to obtain the optimum number of components ( 15)19 ] . in the ga - pls procedure , for each subset of descriptors ( i.e. , for each chromosome of the ga ) , a pls model was developed separately and consequently the number of latent variables was optimized . the pls regression method used was the nipals - based algorithm found in the chemometrics toolbox of matlab software ( version 6.5 ; math work inc . , based on the haaland and thomas f - ratio criterion we performed the leave - one - out cross - validation procedure as it was applied in our previous article ( 16 ) . the matlab pls toolbox developed by eigenvector company was used for pls and ga modeling.the predicted power of obtained equations was validated using cross - validated squared correlation coefficient ( q2 ) . in order to calculate q following equation was used . q 
  = 1  (ypred  yact)2/  ( yact  ymean ) where ypred , yact , and ymean are predicted , actual , and mean values of the pic50 , respectively . (ypred - yact ) is the predictive residual error sum of squares ( press ) ( 17 ) . moreover , the predictive squared correlation coefficients  rpred  was used for further evaluation of the predictive potential of obtained equations . to calculate ytest)/(ytest  ytraining ) where ypred(test ) and ytest are predicted and observed activity values , respectively , of test set compounds , and ytraining is the mean activity value of training set ( 17 ) . 
 variable importance in the projection 
  in order to evaluate the relative importance of the variable appeared in the final ga - pls , variable importance in projection ( vip ) was employed ( 18 ) . vip is the sum over all model dimensions of the contributions variable influence ( vin ) . for a given pls dimension , a ( vin)ak is equal to the squared pls weight ( wak)2 of that term , multiplied by the explained ss of that pls dimension ( 19 ) . y - randomization test 
  y - randomization test is the technique ensures the robustness of a qsar model . in this procedure , for each created models , the dependent variable vector pic50 is randomly shuffled , and a new qsar model is developed using the original independent variable matrix . for acceptable specific qsar model , the new obtained qsar equation ( after several repetitions ) is expected to have low r and q values ( 16 ) . the structural features and the experimental cytotoxic potencies ( represented as pic50 ) of the 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone derivatives 1 - 7 used in this study are shown in table 1 ( 8) . a sar study of these compounds demonstrated that the attachment of the n - aroyl group to the 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones resulted in enhanced cytotoxic potencies toward murine l1210 lymphocyte leukemia cells and two human t - lymphocytes molt4/c8 and cem . it was suggested that in the case of various members of series 2 - 7 , alignment of the n - aroyl groups with auxiliary binding sites takes place reinforcing the interaction of the 1,5-diaryl-3-oxo-1,4-pentadienyl pharmacophore with a primary binding site . chemical structures of the n - aroyl-3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones 1 - 7 used in this study and their experimental and cross - validated predicted cytotoxic potencies ( by ga - pls ) toward murine l1210 cells and human molt 4/c8 and cem t - lymphocytes   reprelative error of prediction .    the compounds are included in the prediction set in order to find important structural features of the n - aroyl-3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidones which contribute to the cytotoxic potencies , a qsar study was performed using different molecular descriptors and chemometrics tools . in this study , the chemometrics methods such as stepwise multi - linear regression ( mlr ) and genetic algorithm - partial least squares ( ga - pls ) were used for modeling the relationship between the biological activity and molecular descriptors and the results were compared to find the best predictive cytotoxicity models . separate stepwise selection - based mlr analyses were performed using different types of descriptors , and then a mlr equation was obtained using the pool of all calculated descriptors . as there are 19 molecules in the training set and according to the rule of thumb ( the ratio of 5:1 for molecule  variable ; toplis ratio ) ( 16 ) , mlr models with a maximum number of 3 or 4 variables were selected . a small difference between the conventional and cross - validated correlation coefficients of the different mlr equations ( table 2 ) reveals that none of the models are over fitted , which can be partially attributed to the absence of collinearity between the variables in one hand and using no extra variables on the other hand . the correlation coefficient ( r ) matrix for the descriptors used in different mlr equations shows that no significant correlation exists between pairs of descriptors ( table 3 ) . the results of multiple linear regression ( mlr ) analysis for the compound in series 1 - 7 with different type of descriptors   squared correlation coefficient ;    standard error of regression ;    root mean square of cross validation ;    leave - one - out cross - validation correlation coefficient ( rcv ) ;    f-statistics.squared correlation coefficient ( r ) was calculated using following equation : 1-( ( y experimental experimental ) ) ) equation for calculation of standard error of regression : [ se=  ( ( y experimental  y calculated)/n - p ' ) ( n= number of samples , p'= number of model parameters ) ] correlation coefficient ( r ) matrix for descriptors used in multiple linear regression equations 1 - 3 . l1210 cell line 
 . stepwise selection and elimination of variables produced a three - parametric qsar equation 1 , having moderate statistical quality ( r = 0.70 , se = 0.38 , q = 0.50 , rmscv = 0.45 and rpred = 0.69 ) ( table 2 and 4 ) . the selected variables demonstrate that chemical ( heat of formation ) , topological and spatial parameters ( molecular density and narumi harmonic topological index ( hnar ) mainly affect the cytotoxic potential of the 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidone derivatives against the l1210 cell line . the mlr equation 2 obtained from the pool of the calculated descriptors for the cem cell line possesses good statistical quality ( r = 0.85 , se = 0.25 , q = 0.77 , rmscv = 0.29 and rpred = 0.81 ) ( table 2 and 4 ) and demonstrates that the anticancer property of the compounds is mainly dependent on chemical ( heat of formation ) , topological and spatial ( molecular density and average connectivity index chi-4:x4a ) properties of the molecule . these results show that the parameters that influence anticancer properties of the compounds against the cem line are similar to those obtained for the l1210 cell line . the three - parametric qsar equation 3 ( table 2 ) demonstrates the quantitative effects of the structural parameters on the cytotoxic potential of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidone derivatives on the molt / c8 cell line . this model demonstrated high statistical quality ( r = 0.81 , se = 0.31 , q = 0.72 , rmscv = 0.34 , and rpred = 0.64 ) ( table 2 and 4 ) which reveals the significant effects of quantum ( homo , dipole moment x ( dmx ) ) and spatial parameter ( molecular density ) on the cytotoxic activity of the compounds . it is revealed that the molecular density plays a determinant effect on the cytotoxic potential of the compounds on this cell line . therefore , the molecular density and topological parameter are important descriptors that should be taken into consideration in the designing of potent cytotoxic 3,5-bis ( arylidene)-4-piperidones analogs . the results of qsar analysis by mlra and ga - plsb methods for the compounds in series 1 - 7   multiple linear regressions ,    genetic algorithm - partial least square ,    correlation coefficient of regression ,    leave - one - out cross - validation correlation coefficient ( rcv ) ,    standard error of prediction regression ,    correlation coefficient of prediction regression   in pls analyses , the descriptors data matrix is decomposed into orthogonal matrices , the scores of which are constrained to have inner relationships with the dependent variables . therefore the multi - collinearity problem in the descriptors is omitted by pls analysis . to find a more convenient set of descriptors in pls modeling , , many different ga - pls runs were conducted using different initial sets of populations . given 19 calibration samples , the leave - one - out cross - validation procedure was used to find the optimum number of latent variables for each pls model . for the l1210 cell line , the ga - pls model that resulted in the best fit contained 7 indices ( two of these indices such as molecular density and heat of formation were also obtained by mlr in this cell line ) . moreover , similar to the results of mlr analysis , ga - pls analysis also showed that topological parameters affect the cytotoxic potencies of the compounds in the l1210 cell line . as per ga - pls modeling , a combination of chemical ( heat of formation , melting point ) , quantum chemical ( dipole moment x ) , conformational ( torsion energy ) and spatial ( molecular density ) descriptors account for the cytotoxic potential of the compounds toward l1210 cells . the resulted ga - pls model possess very good statistical quality ( i.e. , r= 0.86 , q= 0.66 ) . the predictive ability of the model was measured by application to 6 external test set molecules ( rpred = 0.81 and sepred = 0.37 ) . the calculated values of pic50 obtained by the pls model in the l1210 assay ( refined from cross - validation of external prediction set ) are shown in table 1 . to measure the significance of the 7 selected pls descriptors , the variable importance in projection ( vip ) was calculated for each descriptor . according to the method described by eriksson et al . ( 20 ) , x - variable ( predictor variable ) could be classified according to their relevance in explaining y - variable ( predicted variable ) i.e. vip > 1.0 ( highly influential ) , vip < 0.8 ( less influential ) , and 0.8 < vip < 1.0 ( moderately influential ) . the vip analysis of the descriptors of the input variables used in the pls equation ( figure 2a ) shows that the parameters such as topological index ( chi3 ) , molecular density and heat of formation are the most important indices in the qsar equation derived by pls analysis for l1210 cell line . the regression coefficients of the selected variables obtained by ga - pls model of qsar analysis for three different cell lines are illustrated in figure 3 . variable importance for projection ( vip ) of the selected variables obtained by ga - pls model for the qsar analysis of three different cell lines : ( a ) l1210 , ( b ) cem , and ( c ) molt / c8 regression coefficients of the selected variables derived by the ga - pls model for qsar analysis of three different cell lines : ( a ) l1210 , ( b ) cem , and ( c ) molt / c8   the best ga - pls model to predict cytotoxic activities of the compounds in series 1 - 7 toward the cem cell line includes 10 indices ( three of the indices are similar to that obtained by the mlr analysis ) . a combination of topological ( x1a ) , chi-1(average connectivity index ) , pw3 ( randic shape index ) , x3av ( average valance connectivity ) , sic2 ( structural information content : symmetry 2-order ) ) , geometrical ( sph ( spherocity of molecule ) ) , chemical ( logp ) , spatial ( molecular density ) , electrotopological state ( sum of the e - state value for the ch group in the aromatic ring ( s_aach ) and sum of the e - state value for the methyl group ( s_sch3 ) ) indices account for the cytotoxic properties of the 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones toward the cem cell line . the resulted ga - pls model showed high statistical quality ( i.e. , r = 0.87 and q = 0.71 ) . the predictive ability of the model was measured by application to 6 external test set molecules ( rpred = 0.83 and sepred = 0.35 ) . the pic50 values used in the pls model ( refined from cross - validation of external prediction set ) are shown in table 1 . the vip analysis of pls equation presented in figure 2b suggests that among the selected descriptors , topological and electrotopological parameters such as x1a , pw3 , x3av and estate keys ( s_sch3 and s_aach ) are important influential descriptors . similar to the l1210 cell line , the molecular density of the compounds is also a determinant parameter that influence cytotoxicity of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones against the cem cell line . molt 4/c8 cell line 
  a combination of 8 selected variables such as chemical ( hydration energy ) , topological ( x2a ) , geometrical ( pw3 , j3d ( 3d - balaban index ) , sph ) , spatial ( molecular density ) and electrotopological state indices ( sum of the e - state value for the ch group in the aromatic ring ( saach ) and sum of the e - state value for the methyl group ( s_sch3 ) ) influence cytotoxic potencies of the compounds in series 1 - 7 against the molt 4/c8 cell line as indicated by the best ga - pls model . most of these variables contribute significantly to the ga - pls model as discussed previously for the cem cell line . the resultant ga - pls model demonstrated very high statistical quality [ r = 0.91 and q = 0.77 ] [ figure 3c ] . the predictive ability of the model was measured by applying to 6 external test set molecules and the squared correlation coefficient for prediction ( rpred ) was found to 0.82 . the vip analysis of the ga - pls model presented in figure 2c showed that the molecular density , topological ( x2a ) , geometrical ( sph , j3d ) and electrotopological state indices influence the cytotoxicity of the compounds in series 1 - 7 . the plots of the predicted pic50 values ( cross - validated ) against the experimental values for the l1210 , cem and molt4/c8 cell lines by ga - pls analysis showed r values 0.86 , 0.87 and 0.91 , respectively ( figure 4 ) which indicates that the qsar models are reliable to predict cytotoxicity of the 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidones 1 - 7 . plots of the cross - validated predicted cytotoxic potency values of activity by ga - pls against the experimental values for three different cell lines : ( a ) l1210 , ( b ) cem , and ( c ) molt / c8 cell line all of the generated ga - pls models were further validated by applying the y - randomization test . several random shuffles of the y vector were performed and the results are shown in table 5 . the low r and q values indicate that the good results in our original model are not because of a chance correlation or structural dependency of the training set . r and q values of ga - pls models after several y - randomization tests the statistical parameters of qsar analysis by mlr and ga - pls are demonstrated in table 4 . the results indicate that ga - pls analysis is more accurate for predicting the cytotoxic potential of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones in all three cell lines . the cross - validation statistics reported in table 4 suggest the higher prediction ability of the ga - pls model . this can be a result of the more number of descriptors used by ga - pls with respect to mlr analysis . as far as the less parametric model is obtained by mlr analysis , the results of mlr analysis are more descriptive for interpretation of the structure - cytotoxic relationship . however for the prediction of the cytotoxic potential of novel compounds of these series , the ga - pls model is more useful . it is clearly understood that some of the spatial , ( electro ) topological and chemical descriptors are important structural parameters that mainly affects the cytotoxic potencies of these compounds in all three cell lines . the  molecular density  of compounds is one of the most important spatial descriptors that should be considered in the design of novel compounds of these series . as the results of the sar study of various members of these series suggest , alignment of the n - aroyl groups with auxiliary binding sites takes place reinforcing the interaction of the 1,5-diaryl-3-oxo-1,4-pentadienyl pharmacophore with a primary binding site ( 8) . this result can be interpreted by the important structural descriptor  molecular density  . it is obvious that the orientation of n - aroyl group for better interaction with a corresponding binding site is affected by molecular density . other topological descriptors also affect this desirable orientation of the ligand and therefore play a determinant role in the binding of the ligands with its target receptors . the other important electro - topological parameter that should be considered is the electro - topological state indices which encode the electronic state of each atom type in the molecule :  atom - type e - state indices  . the results demonstrate that the sum of the electro - topological state of  aromatic ch ( s_aach ) and the sum of the electro - topological state indices of methyl groups ( e - state keys : s_sch3 ) are among the important influential descriptors in the cytotoxic potential of 3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones especially toward cem and molt / c8 cell lines . the sum of the electro - topological state indices of the aromatic ch and methyl groups especially should be considered in the employment of different n - acyl substituents . the results demonstrate that similar structural descriptors affect the cytotoxic potential of n - aroyl-3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones in three different cell lines . this result indicates that similar molecular mechanisms are involved in the cytotoxic activity of the compounds in these cell lines . in addition , the previous quantitative - cytotoxic activity study of asymmetrical 2,6-bis(benzylidene)cyclohexanones against mcf-7 , sk - n - mc and mda - mb-231 cell lines ( 20 ) , reported the spatial and topological parameters as determinant structural descriptors in cytotoxic potential of these compounds against the cell lines . this finding also confirms that the same molecular mechanisms are involved in the cytotoxic activity of different analogues of this scaffold .","1-[4-(2-alkylaminoethoxy ) phenylcarbonyl]-3,5-bis(arylidene)-4-piperidones are a novel class of potent cytotoxic agents . 
 these compounds demonstrate low micromolar to submicromolar ic50 values against human molt 4/c8 and cem t - lymphocytes and murine leukemia l1210 cells . in this study , 
 a comparative qsar investigation was performed on a series of 3,5-bis ( arylidene)-4-piperidones using different chemometric tools to develop the best predictive models for further development of analogs with improved cytotoxicity . 
 all the qsar models were validated by internal validation tests . 
 the qsar models obtained by ga - pls method were considered the best as compared to mlr method . the best qsar model obtained by ga - pls analysis on l1210 , cem and molt4/c8 demonstrated good predictively with r2pred values ranging from 0.94 - 0.80 . molecular density , 
 topological ( x2a ) and geometrical indices of the molecules were found to be the most important factors for determining cytotoxic properties .",247
"obesity is the most frequent metabolic disease worldwide and can progressively lead to a spectrum of comorbidities , including type 2 diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidaemia , cardiovascular disease , liver dysfunction , and osteoarthritis [ 13 ] . preventing obesity - related co - morbidity relies on effective weight loss interventions ; however , it is becoming evident that there is also a further need to focus on the daily living and well - being of obese patients . obesity is still associated with high early mortality , but advances in the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and acute coronary syndromes are now offering better cardioprotection options and prolong life expectancy . current data support the notion that in developed societies an increasing number of obese patients are expected to live more than previously estimated , despite failing to reduce their body weight [ 4 , 5 ] . furthermore , demographic and epidemiological projections predict growing and progressively ageing obese populations in the western world [ 68 ] . these populations are expected to exhibit an escalating burden of obesity - related disease , particularly regarding complications which were previously underestimated or underexpressed due to earlier mortality , such as mobility problems and disability . longstanding and/or progressive obesity can eventually impair the physical ability of the patient to function in everyday life . obesity - associated disability has been shown to correlate with body mass index ( bmi ) and the presence of comorbidities [ 4 , 1013 ] . difficulty to perform simple everyday tasks ( e.g. , walking , climbing steps , driving , and dressing ) may complicate the daily life of obese patients to the extent of inability to engage in usual social activities and employment . the consequent impact on quality of life is devastating and may lead to a vicious cycle where obesity progressively causes physical inactivity , functional limitations , and mental distress ( e.g. , anxiety , depression ) and vice versa [ 14 , 15 ] . furthermore , the economic burden posed by obesity - related disability on healthcare systems is alarming with reports suggesting that relative medical spending for the obese may be up to 100% higher than for normal - weight adults [ 1618 ] . evidence from the world health report shows that overweight and obesity is responsible for 815% of disability - adjusted life years lost in europe and north america . notably , data from the national longitudinal survey of youth in the usa indicate that being obese raises the probability of receiving disability income by 6.92 percentage points for men and by 5.64 percentage points for women , which is the equivalent to the effect of losing 15.9 and 16.7 years of education , respectively [ 16 , 20 ] . investigating the relationship between obesity and disability , identifying individuals at greater risk and improving their functional capacity we present an observational study aimed to explore associations between increasing bmi and self - reported disability in adults with severe obesity . the study cohort was recruited from adults with bmi 35  kg / m followed at specialist outpatient obesity clinics at the warwickshire institute of diabetes , endocrinology and metabolism ( wisdem , university hospitals of coventry and warwickshire nhs trust ) and at the birmingham heartlands hospital ( heart of england nhs foundation trust ) . exclusion criteria included obesity secondary to endocrine or systemic disease ( e.g. , cushing 's syndrome ) and disability attributed to systemic disease other than obesity ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , neurological disorders ) or to previous injuries / accidents . patients with disability due to further secondary complications of cardiometabolic disease ( e.g. , diabetic foot ulcers , symptomatic diabetic neuropathy , charcot 's arthropathy , symptomatic ischemic heart disease , and heart failure ) were also excluded . the study was approved by the local ethics committee , and all participants provided informed consent . a total of 262 patients ( 183 females/79 males ; mean age : 44.9  10.5 years ) completed the study questionnaire , and all data were collected according to protocol , including demographic and comorbidity data obtained from reviewing the patients ' medical charts . body weight and height weight was measured to the nearest 0.5  kg using a digital platform scale suitable for morbidly obese patients with a capacity of 300  kg ( seca 675 , seca , hamburg , germany ) . bmi was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters . for the purposes of this study participants were categorized into three bmi groups : group i : 3539.99  kg / m ; group ii : 4044.99  kg / m ; group iii : 45.0  kg / m . the stanford health assessment questionnaire ( haq ) was used as a validated self - report measure of functional ability in daily life [ 21 , 22 ] . the haq has been widely applied in research , and , although initially developed for use in rheumatology , it is considered a generic instrument rather than disease specific [ 2224 ] . briefly , disability is assessed by the haq disability index through 20 questions regarding the degree of difficulty in performing two or three specific activities in eight distinct categories . these categories are ( 1 ) dressing and grooming ; ( 2 ) arising ; ( 3 ) eating ; ( 4 ) walking ; ( 5 ) hygiene ; ( 6 ) reach ; ( 7 ) grip ; ( 8) common daily activities . four possible grades of difficulty are provided for answering each question , which are rated as  without any difficulty ,   with some difficulty ,   with much difficulty ,  and  unable to do  and are assigned a score of 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . in addition , each category has a companion variable for aids / devices that documents if any type(s ) of assistance is required for the respective daily activities . for these variables the patient is also asked to report whether he / she ( 1 ) needs no assistance ; ( 2 ) uses a special device in his / her daily activities ; ( 3 ) usually needs help from another person ; or ( 4 ) usually needs both a special device and help from another person . a complete copy of the instrument and instructions on its use can be downloaded from http://aramis.stanford.edu . provided that the participant has given answers for at least six categories , the average score of the completed categories determines the final haq score ( standard haq disability index score ) which ranges from 0 to 3 ( 0 : no functional disability ; 3 : worst functional disability ) . because healthy individuals consistently score zero on the haq , for the purposes of this study participants were also divided based on their final haq score to patients with no disability ( haq score : 0 ) and patients with at least some degree of disability ( haq score > 0 ) . independently of the haq , participants were also asked about having difficulty : ( 1 ) in standing unaided for 2 to 3 minutes and ( 2 ) in walking more than 100 metres ( if necessary with aids ) . four possible grades of difficulty were provided for each of these two questions :  without any difficulty ,   with some difficulty ,   with much difficulty ,  and  unable to do ,  assigned a score of 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . for the purposes of this aspect of the study participants were dichotomised based on their responses regarding difficulty in standing and in walking more than 100 metres to either having no difficulty ( score = 0 ) or having at least some difficulty ( score > 0 ) . the statistical package for the social sciences , spss , version 17.0 ( spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) was used to analyze data . results are expressed as percentage , mean  standard deviation or median ( range ) . the kolmogorov - smirnov and the shapiro - wilk tests were used to determine whether each study variable had a normal distribution . based on these tests , bmi and haq score distributions in this study were nonparametric . thus , comparisons between study groups were performed with the mann - whitney u - test or the kruskal - wallis test , and correlations were tested by the spearman 's rank correlation coefficient . prevalence rates of disability between patient groups were compared and tested for statistical significance by chi - square test . a total of 262 obese patients consented to participate in the study out of 434 patients that were invited to participate , representing a 60% response rate ( 183 female ( f ) and 79 male ( m ) patients ; with approximately 61.5% and 58% response rate in women and men , resp . ) . mean age of the study participants was 44.9  10.5 years ( women : 44.2  10.5 years ; men : 46.7  10.4 years ) , with a mean bmi of 46.84  8.5  kg / m ( women : 46.4  8.1  kg / m ; men : 47.8  9.2  kg / m ) . approximately 35% of the participants had type 2 diabetes ( t2 dm ) , 37% metabolic syndrome ( metabolic syndrome as defined by the international diabetes federation definition , idf , ) , and 29% a diagnosis of clinical depression . patient characteristics and distribution of participants by bmi group , gender and presence of comorbidities are presented in table 1 . a non - parametric distribution was noted for bmi and haq score in the study cohort . haq scores by bmi group , gender , and comorbidities are presented in table 2 . the median value of the haq score for the entire study cohort was 0.375 ( range : 02.65 ) and an increase in the haq score was noted with increasing bmi . the kruskal - wallis test revealed statistically significant difference in the haq score between the three bmi groups ( p < 0.001 ) . the mann - whitney test was used to compare haq scores between the different pairs of bmi groups showing that ( 1 ) group ii had a significantly higher haq score compared to group i ( p = 0.004 ) ; ( 2 ) group iii had a significantly higher haq score compared to group i ( p < 0.001 ) ; ( 3 ) group iii had a significantly higher haq score compared to group ii ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ) . spearman 's correlation showed that there was a significant correlation between haq score and bmi ( r = 0.420 , p < 0.001 ) , as well as between haq score and age ( r = 0.208 , p = 0.001 ) . after controlling for age , the correlation between haq score and bmi remained significant ( p < 0.001 ) . healthy individuals consistently score zero on the haq , thus , an analysis was performed by dichotomizing the study cohort based on the haq score to patients with no disability ( haq score : 0 ) and patients with at least some degree of disability ( haq score > 0 ) . of all study participants , 72.5% had haq scores higher than zero , reporting at least a mild degree of difficulty in activities of daily living . the prevalence rates of this degree of disability ( haq score > 0 ) between the different patient groups were compared and tested for statistical significance by chi - square test . based on pearson chi - square test , the prevalence rate of disability ( haq score > 0 ) was related to bmi and to the presence of t2 dm , metabolic syndrome , and depression , while it was not related to gender . indeed , the prevalence rate of disability ( haq score > 0 ) was significantly higher : ( 1 ) among participants with a higher bmi ( 51.7% for group i versus 66.2% for group ii versus 85.5% for group iii , p < 0.001 , table 3 ) ; ( 2 ) among participants with t2 dm ( 81.5% versus 67.6% in nondiabetic participants , p = 0.016 ) ; ( 3 ) among participants with metabolic syndrome ( 79.6% versus 68.3% in participants without metabolic syndrome , p = 0.047 ) ; ( 4 ) among participants with clinical depression ( 85.75% versus 67% in nondepressed participants , p = 0.002 ) . table 3 also presents the distribution of participants across the three bmi study groups when the haq score is categorized into 4 grades : ( 1 ) haq : 0 ( no disability ) ; ( 2 ) haq : 0.10.99 ( mild to moderate difficulty ) ; ( 3 ) haq : 11.99 ( moderate to severe disability ) ; ( 4 ) haq : 2 - 3 ( severe to very severe disability ) . logistic regression modelling in this study cohort showed that bmi was associated with an odds ratio ( or ) of 1.128 ( 95% ci : 1.0751.184 ; p < 0.001 ) for disability ( haq score > 0 ) adjusted for age and with an or of 1.127 ( 95% ci : 1.0731.185 ; p < 0.001 ) adjusted for both age and depression . t2 dm and metabolic syndrome when entered as covariates into the logistic regression model did not have a statistically significant effect to the model . these obesity - related comorbidities were considered intermediaries in and not confounders to the association between increased bmi and disability , since based on the exclusion criteria of this study , patients with disability attributed to further secondary complications of cardio - metabolic disease ( e.g. , diabetic foot ulcers , symptomatic diabetic neuropathy , charcot 's arthropathy , symptomatic ischemic heart disease , and heart failure ) were excluded . finally , the prevalence rates of having at least some difficulty in standing ( score > 0 ) and in walking more than 100 meters ( score > 0 ) between the different patient groups were also compared and tested for statistical significance . based on pearson chi - square test , the prevalence rate of difficulty in standing ( score > 0 ) was related to bmi and to the presence of t2 dm , while it was not related to gender , metabolic syndrome , and depression . thus , the prevalence rate of having at least some difficulty in standing was significantly higher : ( 1 ) among participants with a higher bmi ( 8.3% for group i , 27.1% for group ii , 24.8% for group iii , p = 0.016 ) ; ( 2 ) among participants with t2 dm ( 30.8% versus 16.7% in non - diabetic participants , p = 0.008 ) . furthermore , the prevalence rate of difficulty in walking more than 100 meters ( score > 0 ) was related to bmi and to the presence of depression , while it was not related to gender , t2 dm , and metabolic syndrome . indeed , the prevalence rate of having at least some difficulty in walking more than 100 meters was significantly higher : ( 1 ) among participants with a higher bmi ( 18.6% for group i , 44.1% for group ii , 53.2% for group iii , p < 0.001 ) ; ( 2 ) among participants with depression ( 58.6% versus 36.5% in nondepressed participants , p = 0.001 ) . the primary objective of this study was to explore associations between obesity and self - reported disability in adults with bmi 35  kg / m . the data from our cohort of patients with severe obesity showed that self - reported disability , as expressed by the haq score , correlated with bmi , age , and the presence of t2 dm , metabolic syndrome , and clinical depression . this finding agrees with data from the literature that have documented the burden of disability in general and obese populations , as well as in various other patient groups [ 2639 ] . the mean haq score for our study population was 0.607 ( 95% ci : 0.5280.686 ) with a median value of 0.375 ( range : 02.65 ) . krishnan et al . have reported normative values for the haq disability index in the general population in finland , documenting a population mean haq score of 0.25 ( 95% ci : 0.220.28 ) , with 32% of respondents having at least some disability ( haq score > 0 ) . given that healthy individuals consistently score zero on the haq   and that the haq score distribution is not gaussian , we also applied zero as a cut point for the haq score in order to dichotomize our study cohort into patients without disability and patients with at least some difficulty in activities of daily living . in this analysis , 72.5% of our study participants had haq scores higher than zero . this is in accord with the analysis of the data from finland showing that within the studied general population , which included approximately 20% obese participants ( bmi > 30 kg / m ) , individuals with bmi 30  kg / m had a significantly lower prevalence rate of disability compared with obese individuals ( haq score > 0 : 28.4% versus 51.7% for nonobese and obese individuals , resp . ) . of note , in our study the prevalence rate of disability ( haq score > 0 ) was 51.7% in group i , 66.2% in group ii , and 85.5% in group iii , further documenting a gradient of increasing self - reported disability as bmi increases over 35  kg / m . indeed , comparing the haq score for the three study bmi groups , we found that group iii had significantly higher haq score compared with the other two groups , while group ii had also significantly higher haq score compared with group i. the recognition of this gradient may be useful in clinical practice for identifying obese individuals with greater difficulty in performing everyday tasks and could also allow further stratification of patients in order to intensify interventions and prioritize the use of available healthcare resources . it must be noted that different cut points can be used to define or categorize disability based on the haq disability index score [ 40 , 41 ] . haq scores up to 1 are generally considered to reflect mild to moderate difficulty in daily life activities , while scores between 1 and 2 represent moderate to severe disability , and scores of 2 to 3 indicate severe to very severe disability . a study by walter et al . , exploring the effects of obesity on mortality and disability in the older population in the netherlands , has used a cut point of 0.5 to define a participant as at least mildly disabled , as previously applied for participants in the rotterdam study cohort . the results of this study in older adults ( age 55 years and older ) also documented that bmi was related to self - reported disability , with more years lost to disability with increasing body weight , supporting our study findings . of note , applying zero as a cut point for the haq score in the context of obesity provides a distinct measure to dichotomize patients for the presence of disability , which is not affected by the dispersion of the haq score within different bmi categories and hence may be suggested as a less controversial method than using any other cut - off value . furthermore , this cut point can also be regarded as a treatment goal for weight loss interventions . thus , a notion of recovery from obesity - related disability could be advocated similarly to remission / resolution of t2 dm with weight loss . interestingly , studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have documented that haq disability index scores needed to improve by approximately 0.22 units before participants stopped rating themselves as about the same ( minimally clinically important difference ) . in patients with severe obesity , further research is required to evaluate at what extent weight loss is associated with clinically meaningful differences in physical functioning / disability scores and whether certain weight loss interventions ( e.g. , diet , exercise , cognitive behavioral therapy , pharmacotherapy , bariatric surgery , and their combinations ) might differ regarding such functional / health status outcomes . in addition to bmi , the haq score in our study also correlated with age , which is consistent with available data from the general population [ 26 , 39 ] . however , in this study cohort no relation was noted between the haq score and gender , contrary to published evidence indicating that activities of daily living may be more affected in women , especially in older populations [ 27 , 4345 ] . this could be partly attributed to a referral bias of obese patients with higher disability independently of gender . krishnan et al . also reported that disability among women increased at a faster rate compared to that among men and that women had a higher estimated mean haq score ( 0.28 versus 0.18 in men ) . yet , also in this study , which included 1530 adults , this gender difference was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for age . finally , in our cohort of severely obese patients the haq score was related to the presence of t2 dm , metabolic syndrome , and clinical depression . central obesity is a prerequisite for the idf metabolic syndrome definition , and t2 dm is pathogenetically linked to obesity . in addition , for the purposes of this study patients with disability due to secondary complications of t2 dm and/or metabolic syndrome ( e.g. , diabetic foot ulcers , symptomatic diabetic neuropathy , charcot 's arthropathy , symptomatic ischemic heart disease , and heart failure ) were excluded . hence , these comorbidities were regarded as intermediaries in and not confounders to the association between increased bmi and disability and when entered as covariates into the logistic regression models of this study did not have a statistically significant effect . contrary , the published data regarding the association between obesity and depression is less strong and mixed [ 4751 ] . therefore , depression was entered as a covariate in the applied logistic regression model which showed that , adjusted for both age and depression , bmi was associated with an or of 1.127 ( 95% ci : 1.0731.185 ; p < a limitation of this study is that the functional ability of participants was self - reported . however , the haq is a well - validated instrument , which is considered to accurately document the existing degree of disability and is widely applied in research . furthermore , the haq can be regarded as a generic measure to quantify functional impairment , rather than disease specific for obesity . a similar validated and established obesity - specific instrument for self - reporting difficulty in daily life activities is currently lacking . on the other hand , a relative advantage of applying a generic measure is that it allows a degree of comparability between obtained results and available data from the general population and from patient groups with other diseases associated with disability . in this study , a random sample of the outpatient population followed at our specialist obesity clinics was obtained , and the overall response rate was considered adequate . however , the nonresponse behaviour of severely obese patients attending an obesity clinic may not be random but , rather , informative . in this case , the group of nonresponders may have had either lower or higher haq scores compared with respondents , resulting in an overall disability rate for the study cohort , which would be either an over- or underestimation , respectively . overestimation of the disability prevalence among patients followed at an obesity clinic may also result from a referral bias due to higher referring rates of patients with more complications from primary to secondary care . conversely , under - estimation could result from a different referral bias due to earlier / prompt referrals of obese patients to secondary care in order to prevent obesity - related complications . such limitations are relatively common in this type of research ; however , among the strengths of our study is the accurate assessment of bmi for all participants , since these study data were not self - reported , but were obtained through standardized clinical measurements of body weight and height at the included clinics . finally , a cause and effect relationship between obesity and disability can not be determined from this cross - sectional study , and large , prospective studies are required to establish such a relationship . our study focuses on associations between severe obesity and functional limitations in activities of daily living . this aspect of the disease has not received adequate attention , despite robust evidence showing a growing burden of obesity - related disability . almost three quarters of our study population reported at least some difficulty in performing daily life activities , and higher disability was documented with increasing bmi , age , and presence of t2 dm , metabolic syndrome , and clinical depression . such data can compliment current systems of obesity classification which are mainly based on anthropometric measures and do not offer direct information on comorbid disease . indeed , clinical and functional staging systems for obesity are required to describe the morbidity and functional limitations associated with increased bmi in order to improve decision making in the clinical practice . for this purpose , disability assessment should be an integral part of obesity management , including patients that have failed to achieve significant weight loss . thus , healthcare providers would be able to provide recommendations based on the functional status of patients in order to increase regular physical activity according to their abilities and avoid complete inactivity . for instance , exercises that mainly promote flexibility and functionality could be recommended to severely obese individuals in order to improve their ability to perform common daily life activities and accommodate their work - specific functional needs ( e.g. , focus on improving coordination , balance , motion rage , cardiovascular , and muscle fitness ) . furthermore , data on obesity - related disability could support practical strategies to create an obese friendly workplace ( e.g. , appropriate chairs and personal protective equipment ) and built environment ( e.g. , easy access and use not only of medical facilities but also of services such as public transportation systems , community centres , parks , and green spaces ) in order to encourage physical activity , work , and social engagement . finally , potentially contributing factors such as depression , anxiety , low self - esteem , and social exclusion should be also identified and addressed in the context of a holistic approach to combat obesity - related disability and advance the care of obese patients .","self - reported disability in performing daily life activities was assessed in adults with severe obesity ( bmi   35  kg / m2 ) using the health assessment questionnaire ( haq ) . 
 262 participants were recruited into three bmi groups : group i : 3539.99  kg / m2 ; group ii : 4044.99  kg / m2 ;   group iii : 45.0  kg / m2 . progressively increasing haq scores 
 were documented with higher bmi ; group i haq score : 0.125 ( median ) ( range : 01.75 ) ; group ii haq score : 0.375 ( 02.5 ) ; group iii haq score : 0.75 ( 02.65 ) ( group iii versus ii p < 0.001 ; group iii versus i p < 0.001 ; group ii versus i p = 0.004 ) . 
 haq score strongly correlated with bmi and age . 
 nearly three - fourths of the study participants reported some degree of disability ( haq score > 0 ) . 
 the prevalence of this degree of disability increased with increasing bmi and age . 
 it also correlated to type 2 diabetes , metabolic syndrome , and clinical depression , but not to gender . 
 our data suggest that severe obesity is associated with self - reported disability in performing common daily life activities , with increasing degree of disability as bmi increases over 35  kg / m2 . 
 functional assessment is crucial in obesity management , and establishing the disability profiles of obese patients is integral to both meet the specific healthcare needs of individuals and develop evidence - based public health programs , interventions , and priorities .",337

"the recent development of whole slide imaging ( wsi ) is rapidly making many advances in pathology and enabling the creation of novel tools and applications for the pathology community , including virtual microscopy , and computer - aided quantification and diagnosis . in contrast to conventional light microscopy that allows only a view of a fraction of a specimen at a time , wsi offers a digital replica of an entire histopathology slide . the data can be processed with a pattern recognition algorithm to identify features of interest . this technique , called whole slide pattern recognition , can provide more information than traditional pathology slide analysis , minimizes tedious visual inspection by trained pathologists and has the potential to improve clinical diagnosis . first of all , a typical wsi dataset can contain a number of pixels at tera - scale ( 10 ) and previous computational methods used to identify targets on traditional histopathology images , including texture - analysis , nuclei pattern classification , and edge detection , are impractical for wsi due to computational time requirements . parallel processing strategies have been developed to handle wsi ; however , boundary artifacts can jeopardize the integration of the analysis results and introduce a substantial amount of re - processing time . in addition , the abundant information provided by the whole slide analysis also requires a method to provide a quantitative assessment and to present meaningful results in a manner that is easy to interpret . in this paper , we report a wsi analysis method that conducts automatic stain recognition to estimate the density distribution of the recognized stains across an entire pathology slide . the whole slide images were tessellated into smaller image blocks with overlapping regions at the image boundary to enable parallel processing . pixel - based stain recognition with morphological smoothing was applied to identify stains in the tessellated images . the density distribution of the identified stains was calculated by the kernel density estimator , yielding a distribution image of a feature or a particular cell type labeled by the stains . to validate our method , we applied it to specimen slides from an ongoing study using a rat cardiac allograft rejection model and also another study using a rat heart ischemia / reperfusion injury model . in both studies , the macrophage infiltration was revealed by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) with anti - rat ed1 antibody . the accuracy of the stain recognition algorithm was first validated by comparing its results with manual counting without involving the wsi technique . the pathology images were obtained with a standard light microscope and the results of our stain recognition algorithm were compared with those obtained from manual counting . then , our method was further validated / correlated with the results obtained from in - vivo cellular magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , an imaging technique that can detect macrophage infiltration when labeled with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron - oxide ( uspio ) or micron - sized iron - oxide ( mpio ) particles . our method was also validated / correlated with the results obtained from ex - vivo cellular mri , which were conducted using magnetic resonance microscopy ( mrm ) to achieve a much higher resolution for our final examination . to demonstrate the potential utilities of our method , we trained the algorithm to recognize different targets under hematoxylin and eosin ( h and e ) stain and to present their distribution across the tissue sections . we further calculated the diameter of the recognized targets and estimated the spatial distribution of cell nuclear diameter , which may have potential application in characterizing tissue in histopathology slides . the rat cardiac allograft rejection model , as described in a study , was established using dark agouti and brown norway rats ( harlan , indianapolis , in ) as the donor - recipient transplantation pairs . the superior vena cava of the graft heart was anastomosed to the recipient inferior vena cava ( ivc ) and the aorta of the graft heart was anastomosed to the recipient abdominal aorta , with the recipient proximal ivc partially obstructed to increase the pre - load . the graft , with intact pulmonary circulation , received proper pressure and volume loading without detectable atrophy over time . on day 7 after the transplantation , the graft hearts were scanned using in - vivo cellular mri and then harvested for pathology inspections . a suture was tied around the left anterior descending artery for 45 min and then was cut to allow reperfusion . after 2 days , the heart was harvested and scanned by ex - vivo mrm . cellular mri experiments were conducted by using dextran - coated uspio particles or polystyrene - coated mpio particles ( bangs laboratories , fishers , in ) as an mri contrast agent to image macrophage distribution . the iron - oxide particles are taken up by macrophages in circulation and create signal - voids in t2 * -weighted images to reveal the macrophage infiltration in - vivo , offering a unique way to correlated the ihc stain distribution obtained from our method . in our study , the iron - oxide particles were given to the animals before surgery . the rats , undergoing heterotopic heart transplantation , received uspio particles and were scanned by in - vivo cellular mri . the in - vivo mri scan was conducted on a bruker 7-t scanner ( bruker , billerica ma ) . the rats were intubated and ventilated during the mri scan and electrocardiogram ( ecg ) leads were placed on the abdomen using a gating and monitoring system ( sa instruments , stony brook , ny ) . t2 * -weighted magnetic resonance ( mr ) images , an imaging modality known to be sensitive to the signal void artifact created by iron - oxide particles , were acquired using a flash sequence with ecg and respiratory gating . tr = the respiration cycle ( ~1 s ) , te = 5 ms , field of view ( fov ) = 4 cm , slice thickness = 1.5 mm , in - plane resolution = 156 m . the ex - vivo mri scans were conducted using a bruker 11.7-tesla scanner ( bruker , billerica ma ) . t2 * -weighted mr images were also acquired using a flash sequence with te = 5.8 ms , fov = 1.2 cm , and isotropic resolution = 23 m . the hearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 - 2 weeks and embedded in paraffin . # dc2002 ) , which streamed slides in preheated high ph target retrieval solution ( dako # s3308 , carpinteria , ca , usa ) for 15 min . this was followed by cooling of the slides at room temperature for 20 min and rinsing the slides in distilled water before commencing the staining steps . to stain the slides , the tissue sections were incubated with 10% horse serum for 10 min at room temperature to block non - specific binding . the slides were then incubated with 1:200 anti - rat ed1 monoclonal purified immunoglobulin g ( abd serotec , oxford , uk ) for 2 h. after pbs wash , the slides were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies ( lsab kit , dako , carpinteria , ca , usa ) for 30 min and labeled with the streptavidin - horseradish peroxidase ( dako , carpinteria , ca , usa ) for 30 min . then the slides were stained with aminoethyl carbazole chromogen ( skytek laboratories , inc . , a rat spleen tissue section was used as a positive control section , whereas a normal rat cardiac tissue was used as a negative control section . the stained slides were scanned on a whole slide scanner ( nanozoomer 2.0-ht , hamamatsu , japan ) to acquire wsi at 20 magnification . the resulting pathology images were then processed by our whole slide pattern recognition method , as detailed in the following section . the whole slide image was tessellated to enable the whole slide pattern recognition , as shown in figure 1 . the tessellation lines divide the whole slide image into several n - by - n sized blocks and the choice of n depends on the application scenario and the applied recognition algorithm . a higher value offers a larger field of view , but it may exceed the maximum allowable image size for the algorithm . after tessellation , each block was padded with an additional margin , m - pixel wide , to the neighboring block . the padding setting was devised for accurate accounting of stains near the block boundary , since a strict boundary could bisect a stain , incorrectly assigning it to both neighboring blocks . the choice of m considers the span of individual stain and requires prior information about their morphology . an m - pixel - wide margin allows stains with a maximum span of m to be fully recognized within the tessellated image . in our study , we used n = 1000 and the value of m was set to 100 . the tessellation scheme for the whole slide pattern recognition . the whole slide image is tessellated into n - by - n sized blocks to enable parallel recognition . each block is patched with additional m - width margin to consider stains bisected by the tessellation boundary the center of each recognized stain can be used to determine whether it should be counted or ignored to avoid double counting of stains , as illustrated by the example scenario in figure 2 . one should note that the tessellation borders are present at all sides of the tessellated image and figure 2 shows only the border between two adjacent images blocks to simplify the illustration . as shown in figure 2a , our stain recognition algorithm is applied to the image block to the left and the recognized stains with center points inside the tessellation line ( annotated by yellow ) are counted , whereas those outside the line ( annotated by red ) are ignored . similarly , in figure 2b , our stain recognition algorithm is applied to the image block to the right . the recognized stains with center points inside the tessellation line ( annotated by yellow ) are counted , whereas the rest are ignored ( annotated by red ) . ( a ) the stain recognition is applied to the image block to the left to recognize the stains . the center locations of the stains ( marked by dot points ) are used to determine whether a recognized stain should be counted ( annotated by yellow ) or ignored ( annotated by red ) . ( b ) the stain recognition is applied to the image block to the right , showing how double counting is avoided . the counted stains ( annotated by yellow ) have center points located inside the tessellation line the flow chart of our stain recognition algorithm is shown in figure 3 . the method is composed of three modules , including a classification module that performs pixel - wise color classification , a morphology smoothing module that eliminates the fragments considered to be false positives and an analysis module that identifies each isolated stain region . it is noteworthy that a variety of stain recognition algorithms can be applied to this problem , and in this study , we have used the simplest pixel - wise color recognition approach for its low computation time and stable performance . the red - green - blue color channels were used as the classification features and the output ( classification result ) was either 0 ( background ) or 1 ( foreground ) . the stain classification was conducted using nearest neighbor method , a popular method in data mining . nearest neighbor method required a training dataset of background and foreground stain image . in this study , we manually cropped the background and foreground stain from the wsi data as the training dataset . alternatively , one may also get training data from the positive and negative controls . the nearest neighbor method classified each image pixel based on its color difference with the pixels in the training images . if the minimum difference was from the foreground stain , then the pixel was classified as foreground ; otherwise , it was classified as background . this classification was applied to each pixel in the input image [ figure 3b ] to obtain the binary recognition output [ figure 3c ] . this output image might have small fragments due to error classification or the partial slice coverage of the stained cells . to eliminate fragments in the binary images and to facilitate analysis , morphological opening and closing were applied 3 times using a 3-by-3 square structuring element to smooth the contours of the recognized stains , as shown in figure 3d . finally , the connected component analysis identified each isolated stain region in the image and the center location of each stain was calculated for further density estimation . the pixel - wise classification is trained by a foreground stain image and also a background stain image ( a ) . each pixel of the input image ( b ) is then classified using nearest neighbor classification to obtain a binary image ( c ) . the small fragments in the binary image are then eliminated by morphological closing and opening , resulting in a smoother output ( d ) . this image is then analyzed by connected component analysis to obtain the center locations of the recognized stains since the locations of the recognized stains were discrete points scattered across the wsi , a regression analysis method was used to calculate their density distribution . this was carried out by the kernel density estimator as shown in figure 4 , where figure 4a shows an exemplary result of the discrete stain locations and figure 4b shows their density distribution estimated by the kernel density estimator . we had a total of k stains obtained from our whole slide pattern recognition and each of them was located at coordinate xi . the kernel density estimator estimated the density distribution function by using the following formulae : the exemplary analysis result of the kernel density estimator . ( b ) their density distribution can be estimated by the kernel density estimator where h is the kernel bandwidth and is the kernel function . the scalar feature ( e.g. diameter or area ) of the k recognized stains can also be estimated using kernel regression . where yi is a scalar feature of the i stain . equation 2 can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of the feature across the entire pathology slide . the bandwidth of the kernel determines the variability of the density estimation . a higher value of the bandwidth generates a smoothing effect , leading to reduced variability . on the contrary , a lower value creates a sharper estimation , but may cause over - fitting and larger variability . in this study , we used a data - driven method to automatically determine the bandwidth . we used equation 1 to estimate the ed1 stain distribution images and equation 2 to estimate the spatial distribution of the stain feature . the source codes of our whole slide recognition program ( ws recognizer ) are publicly available at http://ws-recognizer.labsolver.org . the validation was conducted using a total of 4 rats from the acute cardiac allograft rejection study in our laboratory . for each rat , one tissue section was obtained from the mid portion of the excised heart . for each slide , 16 pathology images were acquired on a transmitted light microscope ( olympus proves ax 70 ) at 40 objective lens . the field of view covered different areas in the slide to acquire images with different macrophage density . in each pathology image , manual counting and automatic stain recognition were conducted separately to avoid a spurious correlation between the manual counting and the automated recognition . manual counting was conducted without knowing the stain recognition results and the training data for automatic recognition were selected without knowledge of the manual - counting results . the final comparison was conducted by performing regression analysis to calculate the correlation coefficient . to validate our method on wsi data , we compared the ed1 stain distribution image with both in - vivo and ex - vivo cellular mr images . to facilitate a visual comparison , the orientations of the mr images were manually rotated to match those of the pathology images . the hypointensity patches shown in the t2 * -weighted images were due to the accumulation of the iron - oxide labeled macrophages , a feature that allowed us to examine whether our ed1 stain distribution image was in good agreement with the distribution shown on cellular mri . the rat cardiac allograft rejection model , as described in a study , was established using dark agouti and brown norway rats ( harlan , indianapolis , in ) as the donor - recipient transplantation pairs . the superior vena cava of the graft heart was anastomosed to the recipient inferior vena cava ( ivc ) and the aorta of the graft heart was anastomosed to the recipient abdominal aorta , with the recipient proximal ivc partially obstructed to increase the pre -

( b ) the stain recognition is applied to the image block to the right , showing how double counting is avoided . the counted stains ( annotated by yellow ) have center points located inside the tessellation line the flow chart of our stain recognition algorithm is shown in figure 3 . the method is composed of three modules , including a classification module that performs pixel - wise color classification , a morphology smoothing module that eliminates the fragments considered to be false positives and an analysis module that identifies each isolated stain region . it is noteworthy that a variety of stain recognition algorithms can be applied to this problem , and in this study , we have used the simplest pixel - wise color recognition approach for its low computation time and stable performance . the red - green - blue color channels were used as the classification features and the output ( classification result ) was either 0 ( background ) or 1 ( foreground ) . the stain classification was conducted using nearest neighbor method , a popular method in data mining . nearest neighbor method required a training dataset of background and foreground stain image . in this study , we manually cropped the background and foreground stain from the wsi data as the training dataset . the nearest neighbor method classified each image pixel based on its color difference with the pixels in the training images . if the minimum difference was from the foreground stain , then the pixel was classified as foreground ; otherwise , it was classified as background . this classification was applied to each pixel in the input image [ figure 3b ] to obtain the binary recognition output [ figure 3c ] . this output image might have small fragments due to error classification or the partial slice coverage of the stained cells . to eliminate fragments in the binary images and to facilitate analysis , morphological opening and closing were applied 3 times using a 3-by-3 square structuring element to smooth the contours of the recognized stains , as shown in figure 3d . finally , the connected component analysis identified each isolated stain region in the image and the center location of each stain was calculated for further density estimation . the pixel - wise classification is trained by a foreground stain image and also a background stain image ( a ) . each pixel of the input image ( b ) is then classified using nearest neighbor classification to obtain a binary image ( c ) . the small fragments in the binary image are then eliminated by morphological closing and opening , resulting in a smoother output ( d ) . this image is then analyzed by connected component analysis to obtain the center locations of the recognized stains since the locations of the recognized stains were discrete points scattered across the wsi , a regression analysis method was used to calculate their density distribution . this was carried out by the kernel density estimator as shown in figure 4 , where figure 4a shows an exemplary result of the discrete stain locations and figure 4b shows their density distribution estimated by the kernel density estimator . we had a total of k stains obtained from our whole slide pattern recognition and each of them was located at coordinate xi . the kernel density estimator estimated the density distribution function by using the following formulae : the exemplary analysis result of the kernel density estimator . ( b ) their density distribution can be estimated by the kernel density estimator where h is the kernel bandwidth and is the kernel function . the scalar feature ( e.g. diameter or area ) of the k recognized stains can also be estimated using kernel regression . where yi is a scalar feature of the i stain . equation 2 can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of the feature across the entire pathology slide . a higher value of the bandwidth generates a smoothing effect , leading to reduced variability . on the contrary , a lower value creates a sharper estimation , but may cause over - fitting and larger variability . in this study , we used a data - driven method to automatically determine the bandwidth . we used equation 1 to estimate the ed1 stain distribution images and equation 2 to estimate the spatial distribution of the stain feature . the source codes of our whole slide recognition program ( ws recognizer ) are publicly available at http://ws-recognizer.labsolver.org . the validation was conducted using a total of 4 rats from the acute cardiac allograft rejection study in our laboratory . for each rat , one tissue section was obtained from the mid portion of the excised heart . for each slide , 16 pathology images were acquired on a transmitted light microscope ( olympus proves ax 70 ) at 40 objective lens . the field of view covered different areas in the slide to acquire images with different macrophage density . in each pathology image , manual counting and automatic stain recognition were conducted separately to avoid a spurious correlation between the manual counting and the automated recognition . manual counting was conducted without knowing the stain recognition results and the training data for automatic recognition were selected without knowledge of the manual - counting results . to validate our method on wsi data , we compared the ed1 stain distribution image with both in - vivo and ex - vivo cellular mr images . to facilitate a visual comparison , the orientations of the mr images were manually rotated to match those of the pathology images . the hypointensity patches shown in the t2 * -weighted images were due to the accumulation of the iron - oxide labeled macrophages , a feature that allowed us to examine whether our ed1 stain distribution image was in good agreement with the distribution shown on cellular mri . the sample result of the stain recognition algorithm is shown in figure 5a , where the recognized stains are annotated by the yellow contour . the training images are presented in figure 5b and c , which are the background and foreground ihc stain images , respectively . the image shows the infiltration of ed1 macrophages due to acute cardiac allograft transplant rejection and the brownish ihc stains were identified by our recognition method . the total numbers of macrophages were counted by summing up the number of annotated regions in the image and the center point of each annotated region can be calculated to facilitate further stain density estimation . the result of our stain recognition and the training images used in the stain classification . ( a ) the stain recognition is applied to a pathology image of myocardium under acute cardiac allograft rejection , where macrophage accumulation revealed by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) stains can be recognized by our algorithm . the stain recognition algorithm is trained by using one background image ( b ) and one foreground ihc stain image ( c ) and the recognized stains are annotated by yellow to illustrate the performance of our algorithm the result of the manual validation is shown in figure 6 , where the numbers of ihc stains counted by our automated stain recognition algorithm were correlated with manual counting . the analysis shows an r = 0.8029 and a correlation coefficient of 0.8961 between the number of cells counted manually and that recognized by our algorithm , suggesting that the results obtained from our automatic recognition algorithm was in good agreement with the manual counting results . the narrow bank of the confidence interval further suggests that the high correlation result is highly reproducible . one may note that the coefficient of the regression line was 0.445 , meaning that the automatic recognition algorithm tends to count twice as many as that by the manual counting . the systematic overestimation of the algorithm could be due to the fact that the algorithm counted the ihc stains regardless of their size , whereas manual counting may have ignored small stains . a feasible approach to improve consistency is adding a size filter to the stain recognition algorithm . nonetheless , this discrepancy does not invalidate our stain distribution images , since the high correlation coefficient ensured that our recognition algorithm revealed the same distribution pattern and only differed by a scaling factor . the regression analysis shows the correlation between the number of stain recognized by our stain recognition algorithm and that by the manual counting . the analysis has included 64 observations and the regression line is presented between the 95% confidence band . the regression analysis shows an r = 0.8029 and a correlation coefficient of 0.8961 , suggesting a high correlation between manual counting and our stain recognition algorithm the in - vivo cellular mri is shown in figure 7 , where the t2 * -weighted image ( left ) was compared with the ed1 stain distribution image ( right ) . the animal from our rat heart transplantation model developed acute cardiac rejection and uspio was used as a macrophage - labeling agent in the cellular mri . as shown in figure 7a , the signal - void artifact in the t2 * -weighted mr image , as illustrated by the arrow , suggested the accumulation of uspio - labeled macrophages in the endocardium of the left ventricle . in comparison , our ed1 stain distribution image shown in figure 7b illustrated a similar pattern of accumulation of ed1 macrophages in the endocardium . one may note that the t2 * -weighted image does not match perfectly with the ed1 stain distribution image . this may be due to the fact that there could be tissue distortion during the fixation procedure and that the images may not align perfectly with the pathology slides . despite this difference , the highly similar pattern suggested that our method can be used to reveal ed1 macrophages within pathology slides . the in - vivo cellular magnetic resonance ( mr ) images correlates with the ed1 stain distribution image . ( a ) the in - vivo t2 * -weighted cellular mr image , where the macrophages labeled with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron - oxide particles create hypo - intensity patches ( annotated by arrows ) in the myocardium that develops acute allograft rejection . ( b ) the corresponding ed1 stain distribution image shows a similar pattern of the macrophages accumulation in the endocardium . the hypo - intensity patches in ( a ) correspond to the hyper - intensity locations in ( b ) the ex - vivo mrm is shown in figure 8 , where the t2 * -weighted image of the ex - vivo tissue ( left ) was compared with the ed1 stain distribution image ( right ) . the rat was from our model of ischemia / reperfusion injury , with mpio particles used as the macrophage labeling agent in the cellular mrm . the tissue section is outlined ( black ) in the ed1 stain distribution image to facilitate comparison . as shown in figure 8a , the mpio - labeled macrophages generate dark patches and spots in the mrm images , suggesting massive macrophage infiltration in the myocardium with ischemia / reperfusion injury . similarly , our ed1 stain distribution image shown in figure 8b showed the same pattern of ed1 macrophage infiltration in the left ventricle . the high similarity of both imaging approaches confirmed that our method can reliably identify ed1 macrophages within pathology slides . the ex - vivo cellular magnetic resonance microscopy ( mrm ) correlates with the ed1 stain distribution image . ( a ) the ex - vivo t2 * -weighted cellular mrm , where the macrophages labeled with micron - sized iron - oxide particles create hypo - intensity patches in the myocardium that has ischemia / reperfusion injury ( b ) the corresponding ed1 stain distribution image shows highly similar pattern of macrophages accumulation in the myocardium , suggesting that the ed1 stain distribution image can reveal the macrophage infiltration across an entire pathology slide figure 9a shows the spatial distribution of the cell nucleus , lipofusin and red blood cell in 3 rats with heart ischemia / reperfusion injury . the stain recognition algorithm was trained to recognize cell nuclei ( n ) , lipofusin ( l ) and red blood cells ( r ) under h and e stain , as shown in figure 9b . the distribution of cell nuclei can be used to investigate the increase of immune cells during the inflammation process , whereas the distribution of lipofusin may be used to investigate oxidative stress in the myocardium . both three distribution images offer paranomic pathology information of the ischemia / reperfusion injury across tissue sections . the spatial distribution of cell nucleus , lipofusin and red blood cell in rat hearts with ischemia / reperfusion injury . ( a ) the spatial distribution of cell nucleus , lipofusin and red blood cell in 3 rats . ( b ) the stain recognition algorithm was trained to cell nuclei ( n ) , lipofusin ( l ) and red blood cells ( r ) under h and e stain . these three distribution images offer paranomic pathology information that facilitates quantitative characterization in histopathology figure 10 is an example of feature distribution image showing the spatial distribution of the cell nuclear diameter . the diameter of the recognized cell nuclei was estimated using the kernel regression formulated in equation 2 . the feature distribution image can be used to provide a quantitative evaluation of a particular feature and to assist tissue characterization in histopathology . a feature distribution image showing the spatial distribution of the cell nuclear diameter . the cell nuclei were recognized under h and e stain and the spatial distribution of their diameter can be estimated using kernel regression . in this paper , we report on an automated method that conducts whole slide pattern recognition to obtain the stain distribution . regression analysis showed a correlation coefficient of 0.8961 between manual counting and our stain recognition algorithm , suggesting that the labor intensive manual counting may be replaced by our automated recognition algorithm , which is critical for further analysis of the image data from wsi . moreover , the ed1 stain distribution image was in good agreement with both in - vivo cellular mri and ex - vivo cellular mrm . the high density areas revealed in the ed1 stain distribution images correlated well with the hypo - intensity areas generated by iron - oxide - labeled macrophages , suggesting that our method can serve as a surrogate to reveal the distribution of macrophages across tissue sections . the novelty of our approach includes the following : first , we have implemented a parallel processing approach that makes whole slide pattern recognition possible . it is possible that the same processing approach can be combined with more advanced pattern recognition algorithms to extract meaningful features from pathology / ihc digital slides . second , the stain distribution images obtained from our method offered a panorama of pathology information instead of a fraction of a view under the light microscope . this panoramic view is less susceptible to errors caused by subjective selection of the data . in contrast , traditional pathology validation often requires expert selection of the lesion site , making the process subjective and potentially biased . whole slide pattern recognition leaves no bias and presents all the information across the pathology slide to offer more objective results . third , the stain distribution images are quantitative information that can be further analyzed statistically . this unique feature is provided by the kernel density estimator , which is a widely - used regression approach in the field of statistics and has been used in a variety of real world applications . lastly , our method can be fully automated and no human intervention is needed to obtain the stain distribution mapping . this offers a highly objective and efficient method that may enable a high throughput processing of data and massive screening . despite the many advantages mentioned above , there are several possible pitfalls in our method that are noteworthy of discussion . the accuracy of our method depends on the performance of the recognition algorithm and it is possible that an algorithm may give false positive results secondary to poor slide preparation or artifacts in the preparation . similarly , the stain variability may alter the recognition results and may create a false perception of the changes in the stain distribution . both pitfalls may lead to misleading results that are hard to identify and thus , a post - processing inspection may be needed for quality control . first , we did only a qualitative comparison and did not conduct rigorous registration to compare our stain distribution imaging with mri . this limitation is due to the fact that the tissue specimen deforms substantially in the fixation process and the spatial information between mri and wsi can not be perfectly aligned . furthermore , the ex - vivo mri of the tissue - embedded paraffin block can not be acquired because the mr spectrum is dominated by the paraffin resonance . another limitation of our experiment is that we did not examine the positive and negative predicting values of our stain recognition algorithm . although the accuracy of the morphology - based stain recognition has already been examined , it is unclear whether the same performance can be achieved in counting macrophages due to their highly pleomorphic shapes . the current setting is optimized to identify stains with an oval shape , but there can be other morphological presentations in the pathology slides . to overcome this limitation , the algorithm can be customized to accommodate different morphology of the stains . moreover , although there is a positive correlation between the number of the recognized stains and manual cell counts , our stain recognition algorithm still tends to count more than that of manual counting . this may be due to the fact that macrophages have cytoplasmic projections that can lead to separated regions and result in duplicated counts . in addition , the nuclei of macrophages are often lobulated , further adding the complexity of the cell recognition in our use case scenario . counting last , the stain distribution value can be affected by several factors , including the thickness of the sections , the z - depth and the bandwidth used in the kernel density estimator . therefore , a comparison based on the stain - distribution value should be conducted in a carefully controlled manner . the obtained stain distribution image represents a panorama of the pathology information and can be used in both qualitative and quantitative analyses . this imaging approach may also assist pathologists in clinical diagnosis by offering them a toolkit for multiple applications in diagnostic pathology as well as yield newer methods to use image analysis to quantitate and analyze biomarkers , which are both diagnostic and prognostic . in addition , the algorithm described in this study may serve as a new and systematic approach to validate other imaging modalities . the ed1 stain distribution image confirms that the cellular mri technique is able to detect the macrophage infiltration of cardiac transplantation rejection or cardiac ischemic injury in our rat models .","background : whole slide imaging ( wsi ) offers a novel approach to digitize and review pathology slides , but the voluminous data generated by this technology demand new computational methods for image analysis.materials and methods : in this study , we report a method that recognizes stains in wsi data and uses kernel density estimator to calculate the stain density across the digitized pathology slides . 
 the validation study was conducted using a rat model of acute cardiac allograft rejection and another rat model of heart ischemia / reperfusion injury . 
 immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) was conducted to label ed1 + macrophages in the tissue sections and the stained slides were digitized by a whole slide scanner . 
 the whole slide images were tessellated to enable parallel processing . 
 pixel - wise stain classification was conducted to classify the ihc stains from those of the background and the density distribution of the identified ihc stains was then calculated by the kernel density estimator.results:the regression analysis showed a correlation coefficient of 0.8961 between the number of ihc stains counted by our stain recognition algorithm and that by the manual counting , suggesting that our stain recognition algorithm was in good agreement with the manual counting . 
 the density distribution of the ihc stains showed a consistent pattern with those of the cellular magnetic resonance ( mr ) images that detected macrophages labeled by ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron - oxide or micron - sized iron - oxide particles.conclusions:our method provides a new imaging modality to facilitate clinical diagnosis . 
 it also provides a way to validate / correlate cellular mri data used for tracking immune - cell infiltration in cardiac transplant rejection and cardiac ischemic injury .",332
"the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality . dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation . however , the needs for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable . in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ] . inadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate . in our institution , the only sampling tool available to perform the outpatient sampling procedure is the uterine explora model i - mx120 ( http://www.coopersurgical.com/ ) ( figure 1 ) . in addition , the device is sterile and disposable ( one - time use ) . the advantages of using explora rather than d&c as a sampling device include a reduction in hospitalization costs , extra convenience for the patient and physician , and the minimal complications of the procedure . the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses . after obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) . two hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model i , the syringe provided with the instrument was used to create a negative pressure , and the explora was rotated as it was withdrawn . after withdrawal , the tip was cut off , and the tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin saline fixative and was sent for pathological examination . the pathologists who interpreted the endometrial samples were blinded to the instrument or method used to obtain the samples . an inadequate sample was defined as consisting of only blood , cervical mucus , endocervical epithelium , or blood with fragments of endometrial glands or stroma insufficient for histopathological assessment and diagnosis . the age , gravidity , parity , menstrual history , uterine size , hysteroscopy findings ( when available ) , and the presence or absence of any cervical abnormality were recorded on the request forms , which were reviewed by the investigators . for each of the two methods used ( explora model i and d&c ) , the numbers and percentages of inadequate samples and age group clustering were calculated and statistically analyzed . of the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples , the explora sampler was used to collect 224 samples ( 88.5% ) , whereas 29 samples ( 11.5% ) were obtained by d&c ( figure 2 ) . thus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 ) . age group clustering ( i.e. , numbers of premenopausal and postmenopausal women ) of inadequate sample results was also calculated ( figure 3 ) . of the 253 inadequate samples , 82.6% were from women 45 years of age and older ( i.e. , postmenopausal ) compared to 17.4% in premenopausal women ; the age difference was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . the detection rates of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using both methods were assessed and calculated . of the 73 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia , 50 ( 68.5% ) were diagnosed by d&c , and 23 ( 31.5% ) were diagnosed using the explora sampler . however , of the 18 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer , the rates of detection were similar between the two methods . endometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ] . in recent years , less hazardous and more inexpensive and convenient outpatient sampling methods have replaced the traditional , in - hospital , endometrial curettage . the advantages of outpatient endometrial biopsy include reduced cost and less risk for the patient , as no anesthesia is required . furthermore , the discomfort and pain produced by sampling have been reported to be minimal . however , it is essential to ensure that outpatient endometrial sampling is quantitatively adequate and comparably accurate to conventional dilatation and curettage . a sample is judged as adequate if a specific diagnosis can be given from the histological examination of the endometrial fragments obtained . adequacy can be measured by comparison of either outpatient biopsy with curettage histological evaluation or outpatient biopsy with the results of pathological examination of hysterectomy specimens [ 3 , 4 ] . many techniques for obtaining an endometrial sample without the need for curettage have been described in the literature . chicago , il , usa ) and the novak biopsy curette with a 10  ml syringe functioning as an aspiratory device , which have been shown to be equally effective compared to d&c in detecting an endometrial pathology [ 69 ] . however , the vabra aspirator and novak biopsy curette , although widely available and relatively inexpensive , have several disadvantages , including the need for an electric vacuum pump to perform the aspiration in the former technique and the pain caused by both methods . as a result of these drawbacks , smaller inexpensive and self - contained instruments have been developed and the prototype of this class of endometrial samplers is the pipelle . the pipelle has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of vabra aspiration and the novak curettage while causing less pain [ 911 ] . all of these instruments ( i.e. , the vabra aspirator , the novak biopsy curette , and the pipelle ) have low rates of false - negative and insufficient tissue results for the detection of endometrial abnormalities , as determined by comparison to hysterectomy specimens [ 1113 ] . it was found that pipelle biopsy had a sensitivity of 99.2% in pinpointing high grade cancer and a sensitivity of 93% in detecting low grade malignancies ; the sensitivities defined for d&c were 100% and 97% , respectively . while excellent agreement  was generally noted between preoperative histology and grade and the final pathology , pre - operative endometrial sampling more commonly provided underestimates of final grade ( low grade versus high grade ) than overestimates . the explora is somewhat similar in its design to the pipelle , but clinical studies on its effectiveness are scarce , with the effectiveness ranging between 14.6 and 15% according to various studies [ 6 , 15 ] . our own findings revealed that the rate of obtaining inadequate samples using the explora was much higher ( 17.6% ) than the rates reported in the literature . however , most of these cases ( 82.6% ) were obtained from postmenopausal women with atrophic endometrial status . this finding is in keeping with the rates reported by other investigators [ 58 , 16 ] . this retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique . this finding indicates that clinicians performing endometrial sampling would benefit from more experience and training using the explora technique . additional studies comparing the adequacy of samples obtained with different endometrial sampling techniques and devices are warranted . furthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma .","aims . our aim is to compare the adequacy and diagnostic yield of samples obtained by the endometrial explora sampler i - mx120 with endometrial specimens obtained by conventional dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) 
 . methods . a total of 1270 endometrial samples 
 were received in the histopathology laboratories at the king khalid university hospital , riyadh , saudi arabia , between 2007 and 2010 . in the outpatient clinic , 
 the uterine explora model i was used to obtain 996 samples . 
 the remaining 274 samples were obtained by conventional d&c . 
 sample adequacy and the clustering of inadequate specimens according to age groups by the two different techniques were compared and statistically analyzed . results . out of 1270 endometrial samples , 253 ( 19.9% ) were inadequate . 
 the uterine explora was used in 88.5% of these inadequate samples ( 253 samples ) , and the remaining 11.5% were obtained by d&c . 
 the insufficient tissue incidence was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with the d&c ( 2.2% ) and the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . 
 the ages of the patients , as well as the clinical indications for the procedures , were recorded . conclusion . 
 this retrospective study demonstrated better specimen adequacy when d&c was used compared to the higher rate of sample insufficiency obtained with the explora .",320
"falls occur more often in women than in men , and the rate of falls in people older than 
 65  years is greater than 33%1 . falls are 
 affected by many causes ; for example , culture , sex , social services regarding health , 
 physical activities , healthy intake , drug intake , behavior that increases dangerous causes , 
 attitudes , fear of falls , treatment after falls , and personal factors , like race , social 
 environment , and economic strength , are factors affecting personal life and are taken as 
 having a negative effect on quality of life2 . however , these fall factors can be good prevention factors that 
 decrease danger of falls in the elderly3,4,5 . loss of muscle 
 strength in the weak elderly occurs more on the upper part of the body than the lower part ; 
 special knee supporting muscle strength shows a decrease , so that the body sways even when 
 standing with two feet supported on a bearing surface6 . in addition , gait is also affected , so that decrease in step 
 length , stride length , gait speed , and toe off and double support time increase . therefore , 
 elderly persons should increase muscle and maintain balance , and prevent falls through 
 experimental factors like exercise7 . research on fall prevention exercise for the elderly has been proposed , which includes 
 balancing exercise while standing on a hard and soft surface8 , resistive exercise that increases muscle strengthening exercise 
 using a thera - band9 , endurance exercise 
 riding on a stationary exercise bike10 , 
 and maintenance of a maintain static body posture that can improve flexibility , like 
 yoga11 and tai chi chuan , which is 
 effective for balance and motor sensation12 . however , all these studies suggest different methods , and there is 
 no typical method . the otago exercise program is composed of muscle strengthening , balance training , and 
 walking , which suggests a specific training method13 ; in an experiment using this training program , males and females 
 aged older than 70 were randomly divided into an experimental group and control group ; the 
 results showed an increase in balance , muscle strength , and falls percentage , and the danger 
 rate of falls was decreased14 . on the other hand , recent rehabilitation research has introduced a new rehabilitation 
 training method using various forms of tasks that fit the patient s personal purpose and is 
 performed using virtual reality and augmented reality ; the results showed significant 
 functional improvement15 , 16 . augmented reality provides reality and additional 
 information using external projection equipment17 combined with an imagine target , which turn increases the reality 
 effects , which increases feedback , making flexible imagined changes become reality and vice 
 versa18 . therefore , the treatment 
 environment when using augmented reality increases task complication gradually and also 
 helps in increasing the effects of the education19 . thus , this study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of application of 
 augmented reality - based otago exercise on the elderly for fall prevention and to provide 
 basal information . bmi , body mass index a total of 21 elderly women who voluntarily agreed to active participation were included in 
 this study . the selection criteria were sufficient cognitive ability to participate , as 
 indicated by a mini - mental state examination score of 24 or higher . the exclusion criteria 
 were 1 ) disabilities in visual , auditory sensation , and vestibular organs ; 2 ) defects in 
 extremities ; and 3 ) fracture in the past year . all of the subjects received an explanation 
 of this study and agreed to participate . a total of 21 elderly women were selected and 
 divided into an augmented reality - based otago exercise group , which included 10 subjects , 
 and an otago exercise group , which included 11 subjects ; exercise was performed for 12 
 weeks . general characteristics of the augmented reality - based otago exercise group and otago 
 exercise group are shown in table 1 . this study was conducted in order to provide an augmented reality environment for training 
 of elderly women , provide the graphic and vision - based web - camera recognition handling 
 technique , provide the vision and auditory expression technique for emotional feedback , 
 build up vision and auditory models and a recognition information database , and provide a 
 handling technique for situational perception and its reactions as a way of improving 
 balance , gait , and physical factors in falls ; in particular , real - time motion recognition 
 was performed using a preserved modeled movement for measurement of speed of the movement 
 and its accuracy . the first week of research started with a moderate intensity exercise 
 program that subjects could perform five times . subjects stood in front of a computer with a 
 web camera , which had an svga resolution ( 800  600 ) head - mounted display ( i - visor fx601 , 
 dae - yang e&c co , korea , 2008 ) and followed the movement displayed . the computer sensed 
 the movement of the subjects and sent the information to the head - mounted display in order 
 to repeat the task and move to the next level , which increased the speed . the muscle strengthening exercises 
 include knee extension exercise for front knee strengthening , knee flexion for back knee 
 strengthening , hip joint abduction for side hip strengthening , plantar flexion for calf 
 raises of the ankle , and dorsiflexion for toe raises of the ankle ; the balance training 
 includes backward walking , walking and turning around , heel to toe walking , one leg stand , 
 heel walking , toe walk , heel to toe walking backward , sit to stand , and stair walking . muscle training and balance training are performed for a period of 40 minutes each , three 
 times per week , according to the level of the subjects , and after the exercise , there was a 
 10-minute cooling down period13 . the bbs is a valid and 
 reliable instrument for measuring both the static and dynamic aspects of balance in elderly 
 people with stroke20 . bbs scores range 
 from 0 to 56 points , and the higher the score , the better the balance . gait function was measured using a gaitrite system ( gaitrite , cir systems inc . , the gaitrite system was used to measure spatiotemporal parameters , including gait 
 velocity , cadence , step length , and stride length . subjects were asked to walk at a 
 comfortable speed , without the use of an assistive device , along a 10  m hallway21 . fall efficacy was measured using the short falls efficacy scale - international ( fes - i ) 
 version , which is a tool for measuring confidence regarding prevention of falls . kempen et 
 al.22 selected seven items for the 
 short fes - i out of the 16 items of the fes - i . the spss statistical package , version 18.0 , was used in performance of all statistical 
 analyses . the 
 paired t - test was used to determine changes between before and after the balance test , gait 
 function , and falls efficacy test . the independent t - test p<0.001 differences in balance , gait , and falls efficacy after training are shown in table 2 . the bbs score showed a significant 
 increase , from a score of 47.605.36 before to a score of 53.702.50 ( p=0.000 ) after in the 
 augmented reality - based otago exercise group ; a significant difference , from a score of 
 48.914.53 to a score of 52.452.91 , was observed in the otago exercise group ( p=0.001 ) . gait parameters in the augmented reality - based otago exercise group showed significantly 
 increased gait velocity ( from 79.8313.22  cm / s to 99.1811.56  cm / s , p=0.001 ) , cadence ( from 
 100.799.92 steps / min to 116.738.81 steps / min , p=0.000 ) , left side stride length ( from

 50.555.13  cm , p=0.011 ) , and right side stride length ( from 93.6410.48  cm to 
 100.3910.07  cm , p=0.019 ) . the otago exercise group showed significantly increased gait 
 velocity ( from 90.2212.22  cm / s to 103.7612.83  cm / s , p=.001 ) , cadence ( from 107.928.69 
 steps / min to 118.557.67 steps / min , p=0.022 ) , left side step length ( from 51.125.68  cm to 
 53.436.84  cm , p=0.023 ) , and right side stride length ( from 100.6412.79  cm to 
 105.0514.02  cm , p=0.028 ) . the falls efficacy score for the augmented reality - based otago exercise group showed a 
 significant difference , from a score of 14.504.58 to a score of 11.803.71 ( p=0.019 ) ; 
 however , the otago exercise group showed no significant difference ( from a score of 
 12.366.23 before to a score of 11.184.53 after ) . this study examined the effect of augmented reality - based otago exercise on balance , gait 
 functions , and falls efficacy of elderly women . as one grows older , anatomically , 
 physiological aging and degeneration of proprioception and the vestibular system occurs . in 
 addition , muscle mass decreases and postural sway increases , so the reaction time of the 
 motor nerve becomes slower until changes ultimately occur in balance control , which 
 increases the frequency of falls24 . liu - ambrose et al.14 randomly divided 74 
 elderly people older than 70  years of age into an experimental group , which included 36 
 subjects , and a control group , which included 38 subjects . otago exercise was performed in 
 the experimental group for six months ; for static balance , postural sway showed a decrease , 
 from 360.3  mm to 305  mm , and dynamic balance , which was tested using the timed up and go 
 test , decreased from 14.2  s to 13.6 s. in addition , campbell et al.25 divided 233 elderly women into an experimental group , 
 which included 116 subjects , and a control group , which included 117 subjects . otago 
 exercise was performed for six months ; the 4-test balance score showed a significant 
 difference , from 0.42 to 0.01 ( p<0.05 ) . in this study , the bbs score for the augmented 
 reality- based otago exercise group showed a significant increase , from 47.60 to 53.70 
 ( p=0.000 ) ; a significant increase , from 48.91 to 52.45 ( p=0.001 ) , was observed in the otago 
 exercise group , corresponding to findings of previous research . this means that otago 
 exercise might affect improvement in the ankle strategy and hip strategy . in the ankle 
 strategy , the body can move as a single entity about the ankle when the foot muscle is 
 activated on the ground26 ; otago exercise 
 was helpful in walking , standing erect , control of the body when it moves in a small range 
 of area , and regaining balance when moving unconsciously . the hip strategy is used when the 
 body moves faster as the velocity increases along with the distance26 ; otago exercise helped walking posture with regard to 
 movement correction and muscle activation pattern and the helped with balance control with 
 regard to the base of support . finally , we assume that augmented reality is a medium for 
 helping the ankle and hip strategy by allowing individuals to visually compare the modeled 
 motion and self motion . an independent gait makes life productive , and is the most efficient method of moving from 
 one place to another27 . as the elderly 
 age , aerobic capacity , joint flexibility , muscle strength , and bone mass decrease , so that 
 gait velocity and cadence decrease , step length and stride length decrease , double leg 
 support time increases , and heel off and arm swing decrease , resulting in an unstable gait 
 pattern28 . binns29 divided women older than 80  years into an experimental 
 group , which included 19 subjects , and an control group , which included 18 subjects ; otago 
 exercise was performed in the experimental group for six months ; gait velocity increased 
 from 0.80 m / s to 1.10 m / s . in this study , the augmented reality - based otago exercise group 
 showed a significant increase , from 0.79.8 m / s to 0.99.2 m / s ( p=0.001 ) , which corresponded 
 with results of previous research . we assume that this is affected by backward walk , walking 
 and turning around , heel to toe walking , and stair walking in the otago exercise program . the subjects worked on speed , distance , direction , rhythm and muscle tone , and strength 
 while walking . in addition , through stair walking , the subjects practiced with a fixed foot 
 support , acceleration , balance control , extension and contraction of the lower limb , and 
 ankle dorsiflexion to move the center of gravity to control the afferent , efferent , and 
 contraction of the lower limb muscles . as a result , coordination and weight shifting were 
 learned through movement of the lower limbs , and this improvement resulted in an increase in 
 step length of the right lower limb and stride length of both lower limbs , thereby improving 
 gait velocity and cadence . self - efficacy is the self - belief or capability to create a plan and implement it . this 
 efficacy also affects elderly , and decreases as people grow older , and it can be a hazardous 
 factor for falls5 ; in addition , fear , 
 which is the most significant complication of falls , should be regarded as an important 
 matter30 . campbell et al.31 divided 233 women older than 80  years of 
 age randomly into an experimental group , which included 116 subjects , and a control group , 
 which included 117 subjects ; otago exercise was performed in the experimental group for six 
 months ; fall efficacy showed a significant difference , from 93.3 to 91.9 ( p=0.009 ) . two 
 years later , campbell et al.31 traced 41 
 subjects in the experimental group , and 61 subjects in the control group and found that the 
 falls efficacy changed from 91.0 to 89.4 , which was statistically significant ( p=0.03 ) . in 
 this research , the falls efficacy in the augmented reality - based otago exercise group showed 
 a significant difference ( p=0.019 ) , from 14.50 to 11.80 , which corresponded with the 
 previous research . this was the result of repeated training with the augmented reality 
 program and the head - mounted display , which isolated the subjects from the external 
 environment in order to increase concentration . thornton et al.32 have shown that virtual reality participants had greater 
 improvements in quantitative measures and made more comments expressing enjoyment and 
 improved confidence . an augmented reality environment can provide users with direct visual 
 feedback to control their movement and watch their own movement at the same time33 . it implies that otago exercise based on 
 augmented reality can draw a user s interest and influence the falls efficacy . in addition , 
 the improved gait of subjects in the augmented reality - based otago exercise group resulted 
 in increased mobility , which helped in performance of activities of daily living and social 
 activities and was also related to positive physical activity . in this study , we assume that 
 the augmented reality program represented repeated feedback , and the otago training 
 represented a goal of the subjects , which they could achieve by succeeding at each level , 
 and that self - pride increased . the increase in self - pride was related to self - efficacy , 
 which leads to an increase in falls efficacy . therefore , repetitive training using the 
 augmented reality - based otago exercise for fall prevention leads to a decrease in the fear 
 of falls in elderly women and even changes their behaviors . this research showed that augmented reality - based otago exercise is effective for improving 
 balance , gait , and falls efficacy of elderly women and that application of augmented 
 reality - based otago exercise is meaningful . we expect that this augmented reality - based 
 otago exercise will be used in elderly care centers as a physical therapy for effective 
 training for balance , gait , and falls efficacy , and it could be used as a database for 
 rehabilitation . we also hope that augmented reality - based rehabilitation research will be 
 conducted continuously .","[ purpose ] the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of augmented 
 reality - based otago exercise on balance , gait , and falls efficacy of elderly women . 
 [ subjects ] the subjects were 21 elderly women , who were randomly divided into two groups : 
 an augmented reality - based otago exercise group of 10 subjects and an otago exercise group 
 of 11 subjects . [ methods ] all subjects were evaluated for balance ( berg balance scale , 
 bbs ) , gait parameters ( velocity , cadence , step length , and stride length ) , and falls 
 efficacy . within 12 weeks , 
 otago exercise for muscle strengthening and balance training 
 was conducted three times , for a period of 60 minutes each , and subjects in the 
 experimental group performed augmented reality - based otago exercise . [ results ] following 
 intervention 
 , the augmented reality - based otago exercise group showed significant 
 increases in bbs , velocity , cadence , step length ( right side ) , stride length ( right side 
 and left side ) and falls efficacy . [ conclusion ] 
 the results of this study suggest the 
 feasibility and suitability of this augmented reality - based otago exercise for elderly 
 women .",244
"improper nutritional knowledge is one of the most important causes of nutritional problems , which can affect practice and cause more complications . it has been recommended that food choices and dietary behaviors can be impressed by knowledge about diet ( 1 ) . to effectively improve healthy eating , it is necessary to understand the nutritional attitudes and beliefs of the general community ( 2 ) . age , education level , gender and marital status can influence nutritional knowledge , attitude and practice ( kap ) ( 3 ) . the association of socioeconomic status ( ses ) with nutrition knowledge and beliefs has been confirmed ( 4 ) . many studies have found that nutrient intakes and dietary patterns of people in low ses groups threaten the general health and raise the risk of nutritional disease ( 5,6 ) . people in low ses group , due to lack of access to health care , improper living conditions , less knowledge and greater psychological stress , may be at a higher risk of poorer health conditions more than others ( 7 - 10 ) . with respect to the association of ses index with health behaviors ( 11 ) and undesirable health consequences , it is of prime importance to evaluate the effect of ses index on health - related behaviors . 
 
 in this study , the association between nutritional kap with ses was assessed among the iranians in urban and rural regions of 31 provinces of iran . the study population consisted of 14,136 iranian households who lived in urban and rural regions of 31 provinces , selected by multi - stage cluster sampling . non - iranian households were not included in the survey , and the households who were absent for tree times at the time of the interview were also excluded . the method of study has been published in a previous survey ( 12 ) . mothers or any over 15-year old member of the households , who were in charge of cooking for the entire family , were considered as statistical units of the study . a structured questionnaire and interview with a qualified person in families nutritional knowledge questions inquired about main food groups , causes of consuming food , role of main food groups , sources of protein intake , and role of dietary fiber as well as nutritional attitude toward health - related behaviors and food choices . to assess the practice of the households , the household members were asked about the frequencies of different consumed foods . ses was an index that included household assets ( house ownership , number of rooms in the house , having such equipment as tv , cell phone , car , freezer , washing machine , dish washing machine , phone , microwave , access to internet ) , occupation and education level of the heads of the families and the respondents and number of family members . data were analyzed using the stata version 11.0 ( stata corp , college station , tex . ) ( survey analysis ) . data were analyzed using the stata version 11.0 ( stata corp , college station , tex . ) ( survey analysis ) . the percentage of nutritional knowledge was significantly higher in families with good ses and it linearly increased with family ses . most people consumed food to prevent disease and be healthy ( 54.7% , 95% ci : 53.5 , 56.0 ) . more than half percent of households were aware of grain , meat and legumes , and dairy group ( 60.5% , 69.7% , and 52.5% , respectively ) . the percentage of knowledge about identification of fruit , vegetable and fat groups was less than half percent . about 73.1% of the households ( 95% ci : 71.9 , 74.3 ) were familiar with the role of dairy group ( growing and strengthen teeth and bones ) , although less than 10% of them were aware of the role of fruit groups in providing dietary fiber ( 8.6% , 95% ci : 7.1 , 9.2 ) . the percent of participants knowledge about legumes and soy , another source of protein , was 45.5% ( 95% ci : 44.2 , 46.8 ) and 40.1% ( 95% ci : 38.8 , 41.5 ) , respectively . only 10.1% of the participants were familiar with the concept of dietary fiber ; among them , the most percentage of knowledge belonged to bowel movement . 
 
 * ( % ( 95% ci ) ) , p<0.05 , ses ; socioeconomic status 
 
 the percentage of attitude is shown in table 2 . more than 97% of the participants had a favorable attitude towards the importance of nutrition and diet in health . respectively , 90.3% , and 70.4% of the participants had a favorable attitude toward importance of nutritional requirements of children rather than adults and the necessity of equal food intake in both genders when there is few food . the percentage of a favorable attitude of the family with good , moderate and weak ses about preferring fruit consumption than bread at time of hunger was 39.8% , 50.8% and 58.5% , respectively . the percentage of participants who disagreed with consuming steam cooked rice was significantly higher in families with weak ses . about 80.5% of the participants had a favorable attitude toward preferring consumption of tuna fish and the lowest percentage was related to weak ses families . households with good ses had a more favorable attitude about the necessity of daily consumption of vegetables or salad and the need for milk consumption in any age besides childhood period ( 95.3% , and 93.1% , respectively ) . the families with weak ses had the highest favorable attitude about preferring whole meal bread on other kinds of breads . the percentage of favorable attitude toward drinking water in the middle of eating food and the necessity of keeping body fitness in girls at puberty was 66.5% and 56.1% , respectively . when the participants were asked about the difference between nutrition fact of meat and mushrooms , only 25.4% agreed . * ( % ( 95% ci ) ) , p < 0.05 , ses ; socioeconomic status 
 
 table 3 demonstrates the practice of households based on ses . most households consumed fruit , vegetable , milk , yoghurt , cheese and sugar daily . consumption of foods such as rice , red meat , butter , cream , egg , legumes , dough , chicken and poultry was weekly in most participants . the other items such as viscera , tuna , nuts and synthetic juice were rarely or never consumed . families with good ses significantly consumed more fruit , vegetable , dairy group , red meat , chicken and poultry , fish and egg , while sugar consumption was significantly higher in families with weak ses . 
 
 * ( % ( 95% ci ) ) , p<0.05 , ses ; socioeconomic status the aim of this study was to assess the association between nutritional kap with ses among iranian households . the best knowledge in all items was seen in families with good ses index and it linearly increased with family ses . households with weak ses had the best favorable attitude toward the difference between mushroom and meat nutrition fact , preferring whole meal bread on other kinds of breads and preferring fruit consumption than bread at time of hunger . the consumption of food items such as red meat , chicken and poultry , fish , egg , dairy group , fruit , vegetable and nuts was significantly higher in households with good ses index while the other items including rice , tuna , legumes and sugar were consumed the most in weak families . these findings are supported by other surveys that have shown that more intake of fruit and vegetable are related to more diet costs , and diet rich in fat and sugar is contributed to lower costs ( 13,14 ) . findings from a survey on 4,356 us adults suggested that better ses index independently promotes the possibility of adequate fruits and vegetables intake and overall diet quality . they also reported that nutritional knowledge and belief can affect the positive association between ses and diet quality indicators(4 ) . as it is confirmed in other studies , the socio - demographic variation in intake can be associated with nutritional knowledge as a partial mediator in improving diet . the result of this study also revealed that healthy eating was significantly associated with knowledge and possibility of meeting current recommendations for fruit , vegetable and fat intake ( 15 ) . the association of ses and dietary knowledge or income and diet is supported by other studies ( 16 - 19 ) . another way that ses can influence diet is related to food purchasing differences . a study on australians in 2000 showed that food purchasing differences due to household income is related to diet via food - cost concern ( 20 ) . food purchase decisions due to a person s attitude toward food price can influence diet quality . based on this survey , people who care about food price were more likely to live in low - income , food - insecure households , they had low education , were tenants and did not own homes , and were service workers . they were more susceptible to diseases such as overweight , high blood pressure , heart disease and diabetes than the others ( 21 ) . our results showed higher consumption of food items such as sugar , tuna and lower consumption of nuts and protein sources such as meat , fish , egg and dairy product in families with weak ses , which can be associated with an increased rate of some diseases . thus , implementing measures to guide people in the line of healthier nutrition is necessary and it can help decrease the rate of diet - related diseases , especially in low ses households . with respect to the increasing nutritional disease and the important role of dietary behaviors , increasing nutritional kap may be a way to change life style and health related behaviors , but it is not enough . therefore , targeted policies should be coupled with efforts to promote diet and nutritional kap for those people with unfavorable socio - economic status . some cost - effective strategies should be presented for the low - income groups in the society to neutralize the negative effect of income on food purchasing patterns and health related life style .","background : improper nutritional knowledge is one of the most important causes of nutritional problems , 
 which can affect practice and cause more complications . the aim of this study was to assess the association between 
 nutritional knowledge , attitude and practice ( kap ) of iranian households with socioeconomic status

 methods : the study population was 14,136 households ( 57 clusters of 8 individuals in each province ) who 
 lived in urban and rural regions of 31 provinces of iran . 
 the sample size of the study was selected using multistage 
 cluster sampling technique . a structured questionnaire and interview with the qualified person in each 
 family 
 was used to collect data . 
 the questionnaire included demographic , ses and nutritional kap questions . 
 using principle component analysis , some variables including household assets , occupation and education level 
 of the heads of the families and respondents and the number of family members were used to construct family 
 ses . 
 the ses was categorized as good , moderate and weak . 
 pearson s chi - square test was used to analyze categorical 
 variables . 
 results : the percentage of knowledge about growing up , acquiring energy and being healthy as reasons for 
 eating food was 24.1% , 44.8% and 54.7% , respectively . 
 only 69.7% , 60.5% and 52.5% of the participants had 
 knowledge of identification of meat and legumes , grain and dairy group , respectively . 
 more than 97% of the 
 participants had a favorable attitude toward importance of nutrition in health . 
 the nutritional knowledge linearly 
 increased with increasing ses . 
 families with good ses significantly consumed more fruit , vegetable , dairy 
 group , red meat , chicken and poultry , fish and egg while sugar consumption was significantly higher in families 
 with weak ses ( p<0.05 ) . 
 conclusion : ses can influence the rate of nutritional kap . some policies should be considered to increase nutritional kap especially in lower ses group in the society .",406

in 1 , surgery resulted in seizure improvement . surprisingly , only 1 patient showed hypsarrhythmia on eeg ; however , all had highly abnormal eegs with abundant epileptiform activity , which can be associated with epileptic spasms . the absence of classic hypsarrhythmia means that these patients differ from those with west syndrome , which has been the focus of many recent genomic studies . of note , spasms were present in patients with fcd ( 2 patients ) and those without fcd ( 3 patients ) after careful scrutiny of the mri . because many patients with focal epilepsies and depdc5 mutations have normal mri , the presence of detectable lesions is not necessary for the development of seizures . rather , loss - of - function mutations in depdc5 , an inhibitor of the mtor pathway , presumably lead to excessive signaling of this pathway , which has many functions that could conceivably contribute to hyperexcitability . this scenario would be analogous to tsc , in which a second mutation in the mtor regulators tsc1 and tsc2 is reported in some tumors of patients with tsc . in patients with depdc5 mutations , second hit  could occur either on the other allele or on another gene involved in the mtor pathway . alternatively , an acquired cause , such as a human papillomavirus , has been conjectured to be a deep targeted or even whole - exome sequencing should be performed on resected tissue to explore this hypothesis . given the incomplete penetrance of depdc5 mutations and the discovery of both inherited and de novo mutations , molecular approaches for epileptic spasms should interrogate both inheritance patterns . the detection of inherited mutations has important reproductive counseling implications for families of children with spasms , which needs to incorporate increased risk for comorbidities such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders . the recognition of spasms in depdc5 epilepsies parallels other mtoropathies such as tsc and ste20-related kinase adaptor alpha syndrome . although many depdc5 epilepsies are milder , the convergence of the phenotypic spectrum and molecular pathways suggests that targeted mtor therapies may benefit patients with the more severe depdc5 disorders . g.l.c . : drafted / revised the manuscript , study design , acquisition of data , and data analysis . d.e.c . : drafted / revised the manuscript , acquisition of data , and data analysis . b.m.r . : , s.f.b . , and j. sullivan : acquisition of data and data analysis . i.e.s . and h.c.m . : drafted / revised the manuscript , study design , acquisition of data , and data analysis . this work was supported by funding from the nih ( ninds 5r01ns069605 ) to h.c.m . is supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the epilepsy foundation and the lennox and lombroso fund and the nih ( ninds 1k99ns089858 ) . i.e.s . , s.f.b . , and l.d . are supported by a national health and medical research council of australia ( nhmrc ) program grant . is supported by an nhmrc practitioner fellowship and l.d . is supported by an nhmrc career development fellowship ( 1032603 ) . the work was also supported by the university of washington intellectual and developmental disabilities research center genetics core ( nih u54hd083091 ) . dr . carvill is a member of the scientific advisory board of ambry genetics and has received grants from the nih / national institute of neurological disorders and stroke , the epilepsy foundation and lennox and lombroso trust , and citizens united for research in epilepsy . crompton has received research support from the national health and medical research council of australia . mcmahon has received research support from the national health and medical research council of australia . howell has received research support from the national health and medical research council gustav nossal postgraduate scholarship and her husband holds stock options for general electric ( medical imaging equipment ) . mandelstam has been an employee of the royal children 's hospital , the melbourne brain centre , and the university of melbourne . dr . leventer has received honoraria for travel from the asia oceania congress of child neurology and has received research support from the national health and medical research council project grant 1068278 , the national health and medical research council project grant 1059666 , and campbell edwards trust research support . mullen has been an employee of the florey institute of neuroscience and mental health , the university of melbourne , australia austin health , and australia eastern health ;

"the cellular thiol - disulfide redox environment is defined by protein thiols ( psh ) and disulfides ( psox ) as well as low molecular weight thiols and disulfides . in mammalian cells , by far the most abundant low molecular weight sulfhydryl molecule is glutathione ( gsh ) . together with its disulfide ( gssg ) , this pair is often referred to as the cellular thiol - disulfide redox buffer .   in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells , glutathione is highly reducing with a ratio of gsh to gssg of at least 3,000 [ 1 , 2 ] , and consequently the majority of protein cysteines are found as psh . the high concentrations of psh and gsh in this compartment are important in the cellular defense against thiol oxidants , during thiol - disulfide stress , formation of mixed disulfides between protein and glutathione ( pssg ) serves as a mechanism for protecting psh and gsh from irreversible oxidation . in contrast to cytosolic proteins , secretory proteins often contain disulfide bonds , and the glutathione redox pool in the secretory compartments of the cell is found to be considerably more oxidizing than the cytosolic pool . disulfide bond formation is an essential step for the correct folding of many secretory proteins , and in eukaryotic cells their folding and assembly takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) . in this compartment , molecular chaperones and enzymes for disulfide bond formation and glycosylation support protein folding . the maintenance of a proper er redox environment is crucial for the folding of secretory proteins . if the redox environment becomes too reducing , the formation of disulfide bonds is hampered . if too oxidizing , folding intermediates with nonnative disulfide bonds can accumulate . a number of oxidoreductases , which may have different functions and/or substrate or tissue specificities in the assistance of folding secretory proteins , the best characterized oxidoreductase is protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) , which introduces , reduces , and reorganizes disulfide bonds in a broad variety of substrate proteins . the oxidative pathway remains unresolved , but pdi may be reoxidized by a number of enzymes including pdi peroxidases , gpx7 and gpx8 , peroxiredoxin 4 , and the flavoprotein ero1 ( endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1 ) , for review see [ 10 , 11 ] . professional secretory cells are specialized in producing secretory proteins and are characterized by their abundant er . one example is the terminally differentiated b cell , also referred to as plasma cell , which secretes enormous amounts of antibodies , that is , immunoglobulins ( ig ) . while resting b cells do not secrete antibody , they do express a membrane - bound ig on their cell surface as a subunit of the b cell receptor , which upon binding of antigen activates a signaling cascade that can lead to differentiation into antibody - secreting plasma cells . the differentiation is accompanied by many morphological changes to accommodate production of large amounts of secreted antibody . this includes a general increase in cell volume with a preferential expansion of the er . in addition , the differentiation is accompanied by dramatic changes in the proteome of the cell [ 13 , 14 ] ; as expected , the er proteins are significantly up - regulated . igm is typically secreted as disulfide - linked pentamers or hexamers of a subassembly consisting of two identical heavy chains (  ) and two light chains (  ) . the pentameric holoprotein in addition contains a j - chain , which the hexamer does not . as each subassembly contains 16 disulfide bonds and the j - chain contributes 4 disulfide bonds , ros production is increased during b cell differentiation and counterbalanced by a strong antioxidant response . we set out to investigate how this enormous load on the secretory machinery affects the global thiol - disulfide environment of the b cell . we have applied a previously developed method for quantitative determination of the absolute levels of psh , psox , and pssg on all cellular proteins ( including membrane proteins ) in cultured mammalian cells , and combined these data with quantifications of gsh and gssg in the same cells . in this way , we have obtained a picture of the global changes in cellular thiol - disulfide redox status during differentiation of the resting b cell into an antibody - secreting plasma cell . quantitative studies of the cellular redox status involve a variety of technical challenges due to the reactive nature of the sh group . great care must be taken to avoid artificial air oxidation and to eliminate cross - reactivity between the thiol and disulfide specific reagents , which can otherwise lead to deceptive conclusions . by applying a previously developed technology that carefully considers these technical pitfalls , we can quantitatively determine the cellular levels of total sulfhydryl equivalents in low molecular mass thiols and in protein . the key features of the experimental approach are illustrated in figure 1 . to avoid perturbation of the cellular thiol - disulfide status during cell lysis and sample preparation , cells were acidified by the addition of tca to a final concentration of 10% , resulting in immediate protein denaturation and precipitation . this combination of rapid trapping and deprotonation simultaneously unfolds redox enzymes , some of which have low thiol pka and are fairly acid - stable , and quenches generic thiols by protonation . to fully exploit the strength of our approach , we did not facs - sort cells before analysis , nor did we homogenize and fractionate cells . the tca pellets were solubilized by sonicating in appropriate buffers with high concentrations of sds or urea to quantify the different sulfhydryl species in all cellular proteins including membrane proteins . psh and psox levels were determined with a highly sensitive hplc assay based on the thiol quantification agent 4-dps . the total value of protein cysteines ( total ps ) was calculated by the addition of psh and psox and to verify the method , this value was also determined experimentally . for experiments performed on resting b cells , there is an excellent agreement between the experimentally determined value and the calculated sum of the experimentally determined psh and psox ( data not shown ) . finally , pssg levels were selectively quantified by the use of the thiol derivatization agent sbd - f . the sbd - gs derivative is highly fluorescent and can be quantified specifically due to its unique retention time in an hplc chromatogram . in addition to protein sulfhydryls , the total protein content of each sample was determined and used as a common denominator to compare the individual samples . this is a crucial step as it eliminates any bias from a possible uneven division of the tca pellet into fractions . furthermore , the requirement for a common denominator in this study is particularly important , as it also eliminates any bias due to morphological differences between cell samples . the total protein content was quantified using a method based on complete hydrolysis in hcl followed by quantification of released amino acids with ninhydrin . this constitutes a highly reproducible and sensitive method and , with a proper standard , it yields numbers that can be calibrated to  amino acids in protein .  furthermore , the ninhydrin assay is independent of protein solubility and hence includes both soluble and membrane proteins . thus , all the following data will be shown as sulfhydryl per amino acid ( sh / aa ) . as a model for b cell differentiation , we used a previously established system based on the murine b cell lymphoma 1.29 which can be induced by lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) to secrete igm [ 13 , 19 ] . to obtain a well - defined reference point for the differentiation of b cells into plasma cells , we quantified the thiol - disulfide status in uninduced b cells to obtain a reference point for differentiation into plasma cells . cells were seeded to a density of 0.2  10  cells / ml , and samples for redox quantification were taken each day during the next four days . although cell density increased considerably during this period , the protein redox state remained constant throughout the experiment ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . in addition , levels of pssg , gssg , and gsh remained constant ( data not shown ) , and we concluded that the global thiol - disulfide status is independent of cell density . accordingly , the mean value of data obtained for each of the redox species during the four days was calculated , and the relative distributions of the different protein and glutathione sulfhydryl equivalents are given in table 1 . from these data , we concluded that the vast majority of cellular sulfhydryl equivalents exists in the reduced thiol form with only 5% and 9% of the ps and gs equivalents engaged in disulfide bond formation , respectively . together , these data describe the total thiol - disulfide environment of resting b cells , and we used them as reference point for studying the differentiation into antibody - secreting plasma cells . in the remaining part of this study interestingly , the distribution of thiol and disulfide equivalents in resting b cells is very similar to that of hek ( human embryonic kidney ) cells , where 6% of the ps equivalents were found as psox and 8.5% of the gs equivalents were found as gssg . in addition , our observation that cellular pssg levels are extremely low is supported by results in hek and hela cells . it should be mentioned that although cells are grown in the presence of -mercaptoethanol , which was detected in the tca supernatant and also in very small amounts in the tca pellet , it did not interfere with the glutathione or pssg measurements because fluorescent -mercaptoethanol derivatives were separated efficiently from gs derivatives by hplc ( data not shown ) . resting 1.29 cells were treated with lps to induce differentiation into antibody - secreting plasma cells . samples were prepared for global thiol quantification after 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 days of lps treatment . from the sh / aa of total ps equivalents ( figure 3(a ) ) , we find that the frequency of cysteine residues in proteins is fairly constant ( ~2% ) throughout the differentiation . this is in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined values for other mammalian cell lines as well as calculated values for eukaryotes in general hansen [ 3 , 20 ] . the sh / aa for total ps was expected to be largely unaffected during differentiation as the igm monomer has a cysteine frequency of 2.5% ( igm has 1,540 amino acids , of which 38 are cysteines ) . although the absolute value of total ps equivalents remained unchanged throughout the experiment , the distribution of protein thiols and disulfides was influenced by the lps - induced cell differentiation . the percentage of protein thiols engaged in disulfide bond formation remained largely unaffected for two days after lps induction , but at day three the psox values had doubled , and a total increase by a factor of 3.3 was found at day four ( figure 3(b ) ) . likewise , after a lag time of two days , on day three pssg had increased by a factor of 2.2 , but in contrast to psox , the pssg value did not increase further on day four ( figure 3(c ) ) . interestingly , the ratio of pssg to psox remained essentially unchanged throughout the experiment ( figure 3(d ) ) . quantification of soluble glutathione equivalents revealed that the absolute concentrations of gssg remained largely unaffected ( figure 4(a ) ) , but the fraction of oxidized gs equivalents ( gs in gssg ) relative to total gs equivalents ( total gs ) increased from 8.8% to 14.5% ( figure 4(b ) ) . this was caused by a gradual decrease in gsh ( figure 4(a ) ) resulting in an overall decrease of 56% in ( total gs ) at day 4 compared to day 0 . the gs equivalents were not recovered as pssg , which throughout the study remained a minute fraction of total gs equivalents ( figure 4(c ) ) . to rule out that the decrease in intracellular gs was caused by an increase in dying cells , the level of apoptotic and necrotic cells was measured using flow cytometry and staining with the cell - impermeable dye propidium iodide ( pi ) . although the fraction of viable ( pi - negative ) cells decreased during the differentiation by a factor of 1.5 ( supplementary material figure 1 available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/898563 ) , it could not account for our observed decrease in intracellular glutathione ( see supplementary material text ) . as the decrease in intracellular gs was not explained by an increase in cell death , we measured whether gs equivalents were secreted by the cells . no glutathione was detectable in a blank medium sample ( data not shown ) ; media from uninduced cells , however , contained measurable amounts of glutathione , and the values increased significantly on day three and four after induction ( figure 4(d ) ) . it should be noted that these numbers are only rough estimates and that the values are most likely underestimated due to extracellular gs degradation catalyzed by -glutamyl transferase . from the data shown in figures 4(a ) and 4(d ) , the increase in extracellular gs / aa equivalents at day 4 relative to day 0 was calculated to ( 0.23  0.1 )    10 while the decrease in intracellular gs / aa was calculated to ( 0.46  0.05 )    10 . as the two numbers are in the same size range , it is possible that the differentiating cells secrete glutathione ( details are given in supplementary material text ) . the transformation of resting b cells into antibody - secreting plasma cells involves an extensive expansion of the er   and both er resident proteins and proteins involved in redox balance are up - regulated linearly during differentiation . how cells cope with this sudden increase in secretory activity has been the subject of numerous studies [ 22 , 23 ] . this study , for the first time , provides a quantitative overview of the cellular thiol - disulfide status during differentiation of resting b cells into antibody - secreting plasma cells . we applied a previously developed method to quantify soluble gsh and gssg as well as protein thiols and disulfides in cells . importantly , the method includes both soluble and membrane proteins , which precludes bias due to morphological changes during b cell differentiation . we find that the differentiation process affects the global protein thiol - disulfide status with an increase factor of 3.3 in the fraction of oxidized protein thiols at day 4 of differentiation , compared to day 0 . the effects on the glutathione redox status are less significant with an increase factor of 1.6 in the fraction of oxidized gs equivalents . the changes in glutathione redox state were caused by a general depletion of gs equivalents from differentiating b cells . the differentiation of b cells into plasma cells has been studied in great detail at the proteomic level [ 13 , 14 ] . , the cell prepares by ensuring that metabolic capacity and secretory machinery can cope with the mass production of antibody molecules . we did not find any change in protein thiol - disulfide status until the third day of activation , when the fraction of psox increased by a factor of 2.2 . the kinetics for the change in protein redox state were identical to the kinetics for igm production . our results suggest that a general expansion of the er does not affect protein redox status until an extensive production of cargo proteins is initiated . the increase of igm production at day three is possibly preempted by a process known as  proactive  unfolded protein response ( proactive upr ) . the upr is a stress signaling process that is initiated when unfolded polypeptides accumulate in the er . this process leads to an up - regulation of er chaperones and folding enzymes which prevents er stress . while unfolded protein stress ( or er stress ) is not involved in the initial expansion of the er in professional secretory cells [ 13 , 14 ] , it is essential for b cell differentiation [ 26 , 27 ] . upr - induced oxidases such as ero1 may facilitate the change in protein redox state on the third day of differentiation to initiate disulfide - dependent igm polymerization and its subsequent secretion . initially gssg was thought to provide oxidizing equivalents for disulfide bond formation , but after identification of the ero1 proteins this hypothesis was discarded . instead , gsh now is considered to be involved in the isomerization of nonnative disulfide bonds [ 2830 ] to consume excess oxidizing equivalents produced by the ero1 proteins   and to activate ero1 by reducing its regulatory disulfides . consequently , the abundance of gssg in the er is altogether assumed to be at least partially caused by ero1 activity . the mechanisms by which the er maintains its gsh / gssg redox balance are unknown . excess gssg could be reduced by an er resident glutathione reductase , it could be transported to the cytosol for reduction or it could be secreted from the cells . during b cell differentiation ero1 is up - regulated by factors of 3.0 and 2.4 at day 3 and 4 , respectively , and consequently we expected gssg levels to increase . surprisingly , gssg levels remained constant throughout differentiation , but the overall cellular glutathione redox status did become more oxidizing gradually ( figure 4(a ) ) . this was the result of a depletion of total gs equivalents at the expense of gsh ( figure 4(b ) ) . there are three possible explanations for the decrease in total intracellular gs , ( 1 ) differentiation of b cells leads to secretion of gs equivalents , ( 2 ) gsh is irreversibly oxidized to sulfinic or sulfonic acids , which is not detected by the quantification method , and ( 3 ) gs equivalents are released by the fraction of pi positive cells . we found an increase in extracellular gs on days 3 and 4 of the differentiation that was of about the same magnitude as the intracellular decrease ( figure 4(d ) ) . this result supports model ( 1 ) and suggests that gsh converted to gssg by the up - regulation of ero1 proteins and is exported to the media . this export could serve as a mechanism for relieving cells from any oxidative load caused by up - regulation of ero1 proteins . we can , however , not make any certain conclusions regarding the cause of intracellular gs depletion , as the levels of extracellular gs could in principle be explained by the fraction of pi - positive cells releasing their intracellular gs content to the media ( see supplementary material text ) . due to the extremely reducing glutathione redox potential of the cytosol , the vast majority of pssg is expected to be found in the oxidizing compartments of the cell . in a study of liver microsomes , 50% of the gs equivalents were found as pssg , suggesting that a major fraction of the glutathione in the er is associated with protein . however , this fraction was subsequently estimated to be significantly lower ( i.e. , less than 2% pssg ) based on whole - cell quantification with the assumption that no pssg is found in the cytosol . under the same assumption ; that is , that all pssg equivalents are found in the er and that the concentrations of gs equivalents are the same in all cellular compartments , we can estimate that the maximal fraction of pssg is relative to total gs equivalents in the er , in fully differentiated b cells . the er volume is reported to constitute at least 10% of total cell volume in antibody - secreting b cells   and , accordingly , maximally 7% ( 0.7%/10% ) of the gs equivalents in er are found as pssg . thus , even in highly active secretory cells , pssg only constitutes a minor fraction of total gs equivalents of the er . these results support the notion that the er glutathione redox environment is more reducing than previously assumed . it is generally assumed that the level of gssg is critical for the amounts of pssg formed . interestingly , we found that the ratio of pssg to psox was independent of differentiation ( figure 3(d ) ) , suggesting that the oxidizing compartments of the cell maintain a constant level of pssg , and consequently , that the er glutathione redox status is tightly regulated throughout differentiation . this may be explained by the activation of oxidative stress during the early stage of b cell differentiation and followed by a strong antioxidant response [ 16 , 36 ] . maintenance of a proper er glutathione redox environment can be a crucial factor in securing the correct folding of igm . in this study , we have for the first time characterized the changes in thiol - disulfide state during differentiation of b cells . in general , the differentiation does not cause massive thiol - disulfide stress to the cells . the steady state levels of pssg are maintained at very low levels , even in fully differentiated cells , and the overall protein redox state is not affected until late in differentiation , when large - scale igm production has started and the er stress response has been activated . 1.29 cells were maintained in suspension as described in   and after 2 days , cell culture medium was replaced by fresh medium . for differentiation , cells were cultured in the presence of 20  g / ml lps ( sigma ) . three independent cultures were induced with lps and samples were taken after 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 days of differentiation . as a control , samples from 3 independent cultures grown without lps were collected as well . each day after lps activation , samples were collected for flow cytometric analysis . cells were stained with pi ( sigma ) and flow cytometry data were obtained with facscalibur ( bd biosciences ) and analyzed using cellquest software ( bd biosciences ) . cells were harvested by centrifugation followed by a wash step with 10  ml dulbecco 's 1x pbs ( paa laboratories ) to eliminate traces of protein from the media . cells were resuspended in 1  ml ice - cold 10% ( w / v ) tca and incubated on ice for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation . the supernatant , used for quantification of gsh and gssg , was immediately frozen in n2 and kept at 80c until later use . the tca pellet , used for protein thiol quantification , was washed in 10% tca by four cycles of sonication and centrifugation . before the final centrifugation step , the suspension was divided in four to quantify psh , psox , pssg , and total ps . the psh , pssg , and total ps samples were immediately frozen in n2 and kept at 80c until later use . the psox sample was directly solubilized and alkylated by sonicating the pellet in 500  l of 5% sds , 1  mm edta , 20  mm nem ( sigma ) in 0.5  m tris - cl ph 8.3 . the alkylation was allowed to proceed for at least 20  min before the sample was transferred to 80c . thiol and disulfide species in tca supernatant and tca pellet fractions were quantified as described in . briefly , psh samples were solubilized in 5% sds , 1  mm edta in 0.4  m sodium citrate , ph 4.5 and protein thiols were quantified by the addition of 4-dps ( sigma ) to a final concentration of 0.5  mm followed by hplc analysis . for quantification of psox , samples alkylated with nem were reduced by the addition of bh ( sigma ) to a final concentration of 3.3% ( w / v ) . prior to quantification with 4-dps , bh was destroyed by the addition of hcl , as described in . total ps was quantified by solubilizing the pellet in 5% sds , 1  mm edta , and 0.5  m tris - cl ph 8.3 , reducing all thiols with bh , followed by thiol quantification with 4-dps . the pssg sample was solubilized in 6  m urea , 8  mm edta , and 200  mm bicine ph 9.2 . disulfides were reduced with 2.1  mm thp ( calbiochem ) and thiols were derivatized by the addition of 6.4  mm sbd - f ( fluka ) for 1 hour at 60c . to compare samples , total protein content was determined by using a ninhydrin based assay . an hplc assay based on thiol derivatization with n-(1-pyrenyl)maleimides ( fluka ) was used to quantify gssg and total gs ( gsh + gssg ) from the supernatant as described in . for quantification of secreted glutathione , proteins in media from harvested cells were precipitated by the addition of tca to 10% ( v / w ) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation .","plasma cells produce and secrete massive amounts of disulfide - containing antibodies . to accommodate this load on the secretory machinery , the differentiation of resting b cells into antibody - secreting plasma cells 
 is accompanied by a preferential expansion of the secretory compartments of the cells and by an up - regulation of enzymes involved in redox regulation and protein folding . 
 we have quantified the absolute levels of protein thiols , protein disulfides , and glutathionylated proteins in whole cells . 
 the results show that while the global thiol - disulfide state is affected to some extent by the differentiation , steady - state levels of glutathionylated protein thiols are less than 0.3% of the total protein cysteines , even in fully differentiated cells , and the overall protein redox state is not affected until late in differentiation , when large - scale igm production is ongoing . 
 a general expansion of the er does not affect global protein redox status until an extensive production of cargo proteins has started .",209
"clinical professions are often concerned not only with knowledge acquisition , but also with achievement of skills and their application . in clinical dentistry , the ultimate goal is to acquire the essential skills , so students must become familiar with the pattern of clinical skills and an appropriate condition should be provided for their education and improvement . proper acquisition of clinical skills requires time , patience , and practice in a proper context . since medical and dental schools have the duty of training students to become dedicated and skilled workforce , its profound impact and significant role in providing health care can not be overemphasized . clinical training of dental students directly affects the health and treatment of oral and dental diseases in the society ; therefore , not only is the students motivation and effort effective in their learning process , but also presence of experienced and caring educators together with the existing facilities in each department has a significant role in their education . since assessment of the students perspective is one of the necessary elements of effective educational quality evaluation , the results obtained from evaluating the qualitative and quantitative status of the departments via assessing students viewpoints in clinical courses better helps to identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with each department . therefore , awareness of the level of students satisfaction or dissatisfaction from the teaching methods implemented in each department is a determining factor in the improvement of future performance in different departments . so far , a variety of researches have been done , working on different methods for creating learning motivations among students , evaluating the performance of both students and instructors and assessing academic competence of the learners . ghapanchi et al . examined the level of patient satisfaction at shiraz dental school and the results suggest that although the majority of patients were pleased with the delivered services , there are still weaknesses in the fields of students practical skills , pain control , and the ability to communicate with patients . furthermore , a number of surveys evaluating the training of practical skills were conducted at qazvin and esfahan university of medical sciences . with regard to this review , the students and trainers views , which are considered as the main elements of clinical education , could have an effective role in clarifying the strengths and weaknesses of the clinical environment and educational planning . as a result , assessing students and trainers views could be helpful in improving the quality of education . this investigation was aimed at assessing the status of clinical education as viewed by the students of shiraz dental school . in this cross - sectional survey , a questionnaire consisting 23 standardized questions , 17 questions numbered 04 and 6 questions numbered 05 according to the likert scale , was used . all the juniors and seniors of shiraz school of dentistry were invited to complete the questionnaires . among the collected forms , demographic information included the students year of entrance in dental education and his / her total average grade . the questions were categorized into four subgroups to evaluate the students perspective in the following four areas : 
 level of knowledge among the academic staffattitude of clinical faculty members and that of the personnel toward the studentsclinical facilitiesoverall students satisfaction in each of the 11 departments . level of knowledge among the academic staff attitude of clinical faculty members and that of the personnel toward the students overall students satisfaction in each of the 11 departments . all the items in the questionnaire were constructed and standardized in terms of validity and reliability . face and content validity were confirmed by a group of five experts including an orthodontist , a specialist in restorative dentistry , an endodontist , a general dentist and an education expert . questionnaires were evaluated in terms of the year of entrance ( 5 and 6 year ) and total average grade ( grade < 17/20 , grade 17/20 ) . this study was conducted using spss version 17 ( chicago , il , usa ) for statistical analysis . tukey test , pearson correlation coefficient , and two sample t - tests were used . this study was conducted using spss version 17 ( chicago , il , usa ) for statistical analysis . tukey test , pearson correlation coefficient , and two sample t - tests were used . a total of 168 fully completed questionnaires were entered in our study . in all items including proper time planning , presence of a regular educational program in each department , relevance between the contents of theoretical lessons and practical courses , mastery in providing theoretical as well as practical training programs , quality and quantity of the equipment , and overall students satisfaction from each department maximum satisfaction was shown in removable prosthodontics and orthodontics departments whereas minimum satisfaction was scored to oral surgery and comprehensive treatment departments [ figure 1 , tables 1 and 2 ] . comparison of average clinical quality scores of different departments comparison of scores among different departments of shiraz school of dentistry average score for clinical quality in different departments in the majority of items including educators supervision and guidance over students performance , respecting the principles of infection control by both the clinical educators and the personnel and mastery of students in practical skills , removable prosthodontics and orthodontics departments obtained the highest scores whereas lowest score levels were related to comprehensive treatment department [ table 2 ] . in all the departments , personnels respectful attitude toward the students had the highest score whereas minimum grade was given to stressful workload and overall satisfaction in each department [ table 1 ] . there was no significant correlation between year of entrance in dental education ( 5 and 6 year ) and average satisfaction scores ( p = 0.126 ) [ table 3 ] . average satisfaction scores among 5 and 6 year students no significant correlation was reported between students total average grade and average satisfaction scores from departments ( p > 0.05 ) . the results showed that the highest level of student satisfaction belonged to removable prosthodontics and orthodontics departments , and the lowest level was scored to the oral surgery and the comprehensive treatment departments . in a study conducted by janda et al . at california university in 1996 , the level of newly graduates expectations from their occupational future was evaluated . in another survey done by alvesalo in finland , the level of patients satisfaction from the delivery of dental health care services was assessed . the result was 6094% positive ; however , 54% claimed that the fees were too high . a survey conducted by shetty et al . on 45 dental students in india revealed that > 95 % of the graduates were satisfied with the curriculum and between 60% and 90% of the students admitted that the various components of teaching - learning process has been adequate . furthermore , the overall result suggests that despite the fact that educational programs have been satisfactory according to many students , there are still areas of shortcomings and concerns that need improvement . in a study by patel et al . , students reported that the time spent training the practice of medicine , especially medical economics has been inadequate . a higher - intensity curriculum in health care systems may hold substantial potential to overcome these perceptions of training inadequacy . amini et al . at the tabriz university of medical sciences and health services assessed the interns viewpoints regarding their competency level in performing basic clinical procedures as well as the effect of learning opportunities on their competency level . the results showed that the mean level of skills for the general techniques was 51.4% . moreover , the students claimed that they have learnt most of the techniques through observation ; besides that , most of them performed the procedures without direct supervision of teachers or residents . furthermore , the satisfaction of medical trainees and interns from different aspects of education such as educators performance , medical facilities , training methods , variety and number of the patients , and educational locations at isfahan university of medical sciences was assessed and the results indicated that the highest level of satisfaction was related to outpatient training in health centers , clinical teachers performance , training methods , and variety and number of patients , whereas the medical equipment and welfare facilities had the lowest scores . a study conducted by zamanzad et al . assessed the satisfaction of medical students from quality of education in clinical courses at shahrekord university of medical sciences , and it showed that students were unsatisfied with inadequacy of proper education in teaching rounds , outpatient clinic , and theory courses in major clerkship periods . in contrast , high rate of satisfaction belonged to morning report programs . in a study conducted by amanat et al . at shiraz dental school the highest level of satisfaction , regarding clinical teachers and personnels attitude , was from the pediatrics and periodontics departments and the lowest level of satisfaction regarding the equipment and facilities was from the oral surgery department . an investigation done at the mashhad university of medical sciences evaluated the acquisition of practical skills among medical students . the results revealed that the existing status of medical students capabilities is far from the optimal situation . this educational deficit was mostly in essential skills and emergency knowledge for saving patients lives . in a study conducted at qazvin university of medical sciences , in an evaluation of clinical teaching from the viewpoints of residents , interns , and trainees of internal departments , 72.7% of residents , 67.04% of interns and 63.4% of trainees , reported the clinical teaching to be satisfactory . according to eslamipour 's survey , assessing dental students satisfaction of clinical departments at isfahan dental school , the highest level of student satisfaction belonged to the periodonctics and orthodontics departments whereas the lowest score in student satisfaction was given to endodontics and prosthodontics departments . borhan - mojabi also evaluated the dental clinical educational status from the perspective of both the clinical educators and the students at qazvin university of medical sciences . the results showed that almost half of the students reported good performance of the departments of pediatrics , oral diseases , radiology , pathology and restorative departments , moderate performance of prosthodontics , oral surgery , endodontics , and periodontics departments and poor performance of orthodontics department . in this survey , the results indicate that the highest level of overall students satisfaction is from the removable prosthodontics and orthodontics departments , and the lowest level belongs to the comprehensive treatment and oral surgery departments . in comparison with a similar study conducted 3 years ago , the level of student satisfaction from orthodontics and removable prosthodontics has increased whereas the level of satisfaction from pediatrics , periodontics , and comprehensive treatment has declined . it could be said that the high performance of the orthodontics department is possibly related to the fact that expectations from the students are being clearly defined ; other contributing factors are high accountability of the academic staff , respectful attitude of the personnel toward the students , and different viewpoints among the educators . however , the most important factor is considered to be the presence of skilled and experienced educators along with younger faculty members , indicating a proper management system . the result of this survey is in contrast with mojaby 's findings which were indicative of poor performance of the orthodontics department . moreover , the reason for promotion of the removable prosthodontics department , in comparison with a similar study conducted 3 years ago , could be related to all the previously mentioned reasons besides the coordination and high relevance between the implemented educational programs in the department with the curriculum of the ministry . the low level of overall student satisfaction from the comprehensive treatment department could be due to recent establishment of the department , insufficiency of the equipment , inadequacy in the number of the faculty members , and lack of enough time for clinical practice . the low scores of the two departments of pediatrics and periodontics could be related to replacement of skilled , experienced educators with the younger less experienced members , poor educational programming and lack of enough motivation among the professors . also , students current level of satisfaction from the oral surgery department can be attributed to the improvement in the application of new teaching methods , direct tutors supervision during and after each procedure , and the altered policy for increasing the number of academic members and the change in the educational program , all of which occurred during the last 3 years . the low level of satisfaction from the prosthodontics and endodontics departments in other studies , similar to the current study , could be due to the stress and heavy workload , lack of adequate financial resources , and insufficient equipment in these departments . it is worth changing the program of the postgraduate students in a way that leads to their participation in the undergraduate training program . moreover , the policy of increasing employment of the specialists in these fields should be subject to revision by the university officials . on the other hand , the reduction in the student satisfaction level from the pediatrics department of shiraz dental school during the past 3 years might be due to quitting of some of the more experienced faculty members , and this could be the result of some general university policies which requires serious revision . the moderate performance of the oral surgery and restorative departments , similar to the studies conducted by eslamipour and farinaz and borhan - mojabi , also demands more attention from ministry authorities to major dental departments such as oral surgery , endodontics , restorative and periodontics , in order to increase the scientific capability of dental students in these fields , which is extremely important in the dental health care system . regarding the results , the highest level of student satisfaction was from removable prosthodontics and orthodontics departments and the least amount of satisfaction was from a comprehensive treatment and oral surgery departments . compared to a previous study conducted 3 years ago , the level of student satisfaction from orthodontics and prosthodontics departments has raised , whereas there has been a decrease in satisfaction for the pediatrics , periodontics , and comprehensive treatment departments .","introduction : assessment of students perspective is an essential element in effective educational quality evaluation . by identifying strengths and weaknesses 
 , it leads to improvement in future performance.methods:this cross - sectional study was performed through a questionnaire comprising 23 questions .

 maximum satisfaction in most items was shown in removable prosthodontics and orthodontics departments whereas oral surgery and comprehensive treatment departments acquired the least scores . in all departments , 
 personnels respectful attitude had the highest score whereas minimum grade was given to stressful workload and overall satisfaction in each department . in comparison with a similar study , conducted 3 years ago , level of satisfaction 
 was raised for orthodontics and removable prosthodontics departments though it was declined for the pediatrics department.conclusion:the special cadre of clinical instructors comprising both experienced and young members is considered as an important factor leading to high student satisfaction in the orthodontics department . 
 promotion of a removable prosthodontics department is related to the high relevance between the implemented educational program and the curriculum . 
 the moderate performance of oral surgery and restorative departments is indicative of the need for more attention from ministry authorities to major dental departments such as oral surgery , endodontic , restorative and periodontics , in order to increase the students scientific capability in these fields .",376
"the union rate and hardware - related complications remain a major concern in these patients , especially following multilevel spinal fusion surgeries . developing an adjunct therapy that essentially supplements the mainstay surgical management is of great importance to these patients . multitudinous research to gain insight into use of teriparatide ( 134 recombinant human parathyroid hormone ) for enhancing bone formation in osteoporosis is readily available in the literature . its action as a direct anabolic agent in bone tissue , consistently increases bone mineral density and thus improves skeletal architecture . since its availability in market , indications are unravelling and is being attempted in many conditions including fracture healing , dental stability , hypoparathyroidism , and hypocalcaemia . another evolving field of interest is the role of teriparatide for enhancing bone graft union and osseo - integration of implants . it is said to accelerate bone graft union and reduce the incidence of pedicle screw loosening after lumbar spinal fusion surgeries . we intended to study this effect and analyze if teriparatide can be an effective adjunct therapy to achieve solid posterolateral fusion mass and reduce the incidence of subsequent screw loosening after multilevel instrumented lumbar fusion surgeries in elderly patients . an open - labeled , nonplacebo controlled , retrospective , single center study is formulated by shortlisting 62 elderly patients ( male 9 ; female  =  53 ) between the age group of 65 to 78 years ( mean age    standard deviation [ sd ]  =  70.1    3.7 ) , who underwent instrumented lumbar fusion for various degenerative pathologies over a period of time . all of them had received multilevel lumbar fixation (  3 levels or 4 vertebral segments ) with pedicle screw constructs and postero - lateral intertransverse fusion with a combination of local bone graft and allograft . the prime indication for surgery was chronic unresolving low back pain , with or without neurological symptoms , associated with any one of the following conditions : a)multisegmental spinal instability ( spondylolisthesis  grade 1),b)multilevel degenerative spondylosis with or without segmental instability , andc)degenerative scoliosis with or without segmental instability . multisegmental spinal instability ( spondylolisthesis  grade 1 ) , multilevel degenerative spondylosis with or without segmental instability , and degenerative scoliosis with or without segmental instability . we excluded : a)those patients operated with oligo - level spinal fusions (  2 levels or 3 vertebral segments).b)those with 1 or more osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures among the fused levels.c)those with previous surgery in the same level.d)those in whom infection or tumor was an indication for surgery.e)those with 1 or more potential data missing . those patients operated with oligo - level spinal fusions (  2 levels or 3 vertebral segments ) . those with 1 or more osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures among the fused levels . those with previous surgery in the same level . those in whom infection or tumor was an indication for surgery . those with 1 or more potential data missing . selection was irrespective of individual bone mineral density ( bmd ) status , as bmd scoring was not done as a part of routine preoperative evaluation in patients undergoing multilevel spinal fusions . our sample included elderly patients  65 years who are expected to have detoriating osteogenesis potential . associated medical comorbidities included diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and bronchial asthma ( ba ) in 25 and 8 patients , respectively . a mixture of fresh frozen allograft and local bone chips were used as graft . local bone consisted of spinous process , lamina , and facets from the decompression site . occasionally , additional interbody cages were used at insufficient discs especially at the caudal end of the construct to increase stability . following surgery , patients were given an option of postoperative teriparatide use and opting to it was solely based on their own decision . in total , 30 patients who accepted for long - term daily use of teriparatide were in the experimental group and remaining 32 patients were in the control group . teriparatide ( self - administered ; 20 mcg sc injection ) was started for those patients in the experimental group from the first postoperative day , once daily using delivery device . the control group received similar standardized and accepted treatment protocols as those in the experimental group except for the use of postoperative teriparatide . all patients were instructed to take calcium and vitamin d supplements every day following surgery . outcome analysis was done using radiological data which included antero - posterior ( ap ) , conventional lateral view , and dynamic stress lateral view radiographs taken at 12 months follow - up ( figs . 1 and 2 ) . ( c ) mri images showing severe degeneration of disc levels and canal stenosis from l1l5 . ( d ) 12 months follow - up ap view x - ray which was considered as solid fusion ( lenke type 1 ) . ap = antero - posterior , mri = magnetic resonance imaging . radiological outcome illustration of a random case from the control group .

( c ) mri images showing severe degeneration of disc levels and canal stenosis from l3s1 . ( d ) 12 months follow - up ap view x - ray showing bilateral signs of pseudo - arthrosis interpreted as nonunion ( lenke type 4 ) . they divide postero lateral fusion mass into 4 grades based on the appearance in an ap radiograph . grade a represents definitive fusion with bilateral thick bony masses , grade b represents probable fusion with unilateral thick bony mass and thin bony mass on other side , grade c represents no probable fusion with thin bony mass on the one side and pseudo - arthrosis on the other side , grade d represents no fusion with thin bony mass on both the sides showing obvious pseudo - arthrosis or resorption of graft bilaterally . we interpreted grade 1 and grade 2 of lenke 's criteria as solid fusion which is explained as unilateral or bilateral bridging bone formation across the transverse process of adjacent vertebra showing continuous trabeculation in an ap radiograph . although most of the patients had long fixations , segmental cobb 's angle change involving the upper and lower ends of the construct as seen in dynamic ( flexion and extension ) stress lateral views will also be considered as nonunion . screw loosening was determined when there was occurrence of radiolucency ( halo sign ) around the pedicle screws in either ap or lateral view radiographs . change in the screw position noticed in dynamic stress lateral view radiographs will additionally be considered as screw loosening , which may occur at the cephalic and caudal ends of the construct . results were tabulated and statistical analyses were carried out using graph pad prism 5 ( graphpad software inc . , san diego , ca ) . analyses were done using unpaired t test for continuous variables and fisher 's exact test for categorical variables . probability values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant . written informed consent was obtained from all patients including acceptance of daily usage of teriparatide delivery device from those in the experimental group . this study was approved by the institutional review board of chang gung memorial hospital with irb registry no - 201600800b0 and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards stated in the most recent version of the 1964 declaration of helsinki . sixty - two elderly patients ( age  =  6578 years ; mean  =  70.11 years ; male  =  9 , female  =  53 ) are divided into 2 groups based on teriparatide administration following surgery . group 1 or the experimental group ( n  =  30 ; mean age    sd  =  69.8    3.8 years ) was those in whom teriparatide was administered and group 2 ( n  =  32 ; mean age    sd  =  70.4    3.6 years ) was the control group . the presence of concomitant medical comorbidities in group 1 ( dm  =  14 ; ba  =  4 ) and group 2 ( dm  =  11 ; ba  =  4 ) was matched . the demographic variation in characteristics of the groups is statistically insignificant ( table 1 ) . surgical parameters of the experimental group ( fusion levels  =  137 ; pedicle screws  =  269 ) and the control group ( fusion levels  =  144 ; pedicle screws  =  283 ) had no statistically significant variance . duration of teriparatide administration averaged 7.4    2.4 months in the experimental group . follow - up data were available for a mean duration of 25.4 months for those in the experimental group and 27 months for those in the control group . even though follow - up was done for a longer duration , analyzing outcome further after 1 year may not be related to teriparatide use . considering the duration of administration of teriparatide , radiological outcome analysis was decided to be done at 1 year follow - up . none of our patients missed the 1st year follow - up and required x - rays were available in our database for all the patients . radiological outcome analysis was done using ap , lateral , and dynamic stress lateral view radiographs taken at 12 months follow - up . two or more observers concurred stating that there was unilateral or bilateral bridging bone formation across the transverse process of adjacent vertebras showing continuous trabeculation confirming solid fusion in 20 patients ( 66.7% ) of the teriparatide group and 16 patients ( 50% ) in the control group . nonunion was noted in 10 patients ( 33.3% ) of teriparatide group and 16 patients ( 50% ) in the control group . the 16.7% advantage procured with teriparatide use was not statistically significant ( p  =  0.20 ) ( table 2 ) . screw loosening was calculated comparing the number of screws showing signs of loosening to total number of screws in each group . the incidence of screw loosening was 13.4% in the teriparatide group and 24.4% in the control group . this difference was statistically significant with p  =  0.001 ( table 2 ) . elderly patients with chronic unresolving symptoms due to degenerative spine disease are prone to have poor surgical outcomes . they also predispose for more hardware - related complications , especially following long spinal fusions . considering the possibility of poor outcomes , treating these conditions can not be ignored but rather a potential solution needs to be developed which effectively supplements the mainstay surgical management . it is said to play a reasonable role in treatment of osteoporosis . apart from being used in osteoporotic individuals , insights into its action on many other conditions are unraveling . animal studies yielded promising results for teriparatide usage to enhance postero - lateral fusion mass in rat models . in human studies relating to teriparatide , most authors studied its effect only in osteoporotic individuals . in our sample , patients were between 65 and 78 years of age and are more susceptible to have poor bmd . patients had comorbidities such as dm and bronchial asthma that have negative influence over bmd . dm is said to reduce bmd at a higher rate in elderly women , even if the baseline bmd was high . along with postero - lateral fusion , additional interbody cages were used especially at very insufficient discs often seen in the caudal end of the construct . this step also allows the graft to access the pluripotent stem cells of the bone marrow . since a large amount of graft is required for long fusions , there usually is a lack of host bone . static and dynamic radiographs are used for radiological assessment of spinal fusion by many authors , but computerized tomography ( ct ) is considered more accurate . most of the radiographic criteria developed to assess fusion mass consider movement in dynamic radiographs as a main component for assessment . they lack reliability as the absence of motion does not confirm fusion , especially in the case of long instrumented levels . based on ap radiographs , we considered grade a ( definitive fusion ; bilateral thick bony mass ) and grade b ( probable fusion ; unilateral thick bony mass ) described by lenke et al as solid fusion . fusion masses that did not favorably appear to have definitive or probable fusion were considered as nonunion . we also considered change in segmental cobb 's angle , visualized in dynamic stress lateral view radiographs as an additional criterion to interpret as nonunion . formation of a radiolucent zone ( halo sign ) around the pedicle screws seen in conventional ap / lateral view radiographs and change in screw position seen in dynamic stress lateral view radiographs were considered definitive indicators for screw loosening . teriparatide is said to have potential to increase the quality of lumbar spine bone marrow and pedicle cortex and thus reduces the incidence of pedicle screw loosening . it is even believed to increase the insertional torque of pedicle screws when administered from at least 1 month prior to surgery . long - term teriparatide use can be associated with significant improvement in bone microarchitecture and trabeculation . it is also said that ; more than 6 months of daily injection facilitates effective bone union following postero - lateral fusion . considering this , we administered teriparatide for a mean duration of 7.4 months and none of the patients had any drug induced complications . most of the similar studies in literature included only short segment postero - lateral fusions . our study is foremost to discuss the effect of teriparatide on multilevel posterolateral fusions in elderly patients . according to our preliminary results , the percentage of patients achieving solid fusion following teriparatide use was found to be more than that of the control group . besides that , use of teriparatide effectively reduced the incidence of subsequent screw loosening which proved to be statistically significant . our study evaluates the radiological outcome following postoperative teriparatide administration in patients undergoing multilevel instrumented lumbar fusion surgery . even though percentage of solid fusion was more among patients who used teriparatide , the difference was not statistically significant . however , teriparatide was more significantly influential in reducing the incidence of subsequent pedicle screw loosening . being a retrospective study , there are few methodological shortcomings that may have influenced our outcome . the lack of preoperative bmd data , variation in surgical indications , and differential treatment durations of teriparatide administration may have biased the sample . use of ct as an evaluation tool to assess bone graft union could have been more empirical . considering the selected sample size , the study may be underpowered to draw potential conclusions .","abstractelderly patients with chronic nonresolving symptoms due to degenerative spine pathologies are prone to have poor surgical outcomes and hardware - related complications , especially following multilevel instrumented lumbar fusion surgeries . 
 with intention of analyzing if teriparatide can be an effective adjunct therapy to surgical management , radiological outcomes are studied . 
 sixty - two elderly patients were divided into 2 similar groups . 
 group 1 ( n  =  30 ; mean age  =  69.83 years ; fusion levels  =  137 ; screws  =  269 ) had taken teriparatide ( 20 mcg sc injection , once daily ) for a duration of 7.4    2.4 months following surgery and group 2 ( n  =  32 ; mean age  =  70.38 years ; fusion levels  =  144 ; screws  =  283 ) did not take teriparatide . 
 radiological evaluation was done to determine the state of postero lateral fusion mass and to investigate the incidence of pedicle screw loosening at 1-year follow - up . 
 unilateral or bilateral bridging bone formation across the transverse process of adjacent vertebras showing continuous trabeculation suggestive of solid fusion was obtained in 66.7% patients in the teriparatide group and 50% patients in the control group ( p  =  0.20 ) . 
 13.4% of the total no . of screws showed signs of loosening in the teriparatide group , compared to 24.4% in the control group ( p  =  0.001 ) . 
 percentage of patients achieving solid fusion following teriparatide use was found to be more than that of the control group .

tailed ) was taken to indicate statistical significance . stata version 11.0 ( stata corporation , college station , tx ) was used for statistical analyses . in the current study , the cohort consisted of 327 women and 341 men with a mean age of 72.5 years . a total of 158 septuagenarians ( 24% ) had type 2 diabetes , of whom 88 ( 13% ) had been previously diagnosed with the disease and 70 new subjects ( 11% ) were identified in the current study . more than half of the subjects had vitamin d deficiency , as suggested by a serum 25(oh)d3 concentration below 50 nmol / l ( median , 47.6 nmol / l ; iqr , 29.864.8 nmol / l ) . baseline clinical and biochemical characteristics of 668 faroese septuagenarians by vitamin d status data are means ( sd ) or median ( 2575th percentile ) . * hba1c ( ifcc ) mmol / mol can be converted to hba1c ( dcct ) % by the following equation : hba1c ( dcct ) % = 0.0915  hba1c ( ifcc ) mmol / mol + 2.15 ; homa - ir = ( fasting plasma insulin  fasting plasma glucose)/22.5 ; homa-% = ( 20  fasting plasma insulin)/(fasting plasma glucose  3.5 ) ; sum of major pcb congeners cb-138 , cb-153 , and cb-180 multiplied by 2 ( 12 ) . nmol / l , was associated with an 80% increase in the sex - adjusted odds of having diabetes ( newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed subjects ) compared with sufficient vitamin d status ( odds ratio [ or ] 1.80 [ 95% ci 1.232.64 ] ; p = 0.002 ) . after further adjustment for bmi , serum triacylglycerides , serum hdl , pcb exposure , smoking , and month of blood sampling , the association between vitamin d deficiency and type 2 diabetes remained , and the or was only marginally affected ( or 1.67 [ 1.112.50 ] ; p = 0.013 ) . in the separate analyses of previously undiagnosed and diagnosed subjects , we found that the sex - adjusted or for having newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the presence of vitamin d deficiency had more than doubled ( or 2.25 [ 95% ci 1.313.85 ] ; p = 0.003 ) . after further adjustment for bmi , serum triacylglycerides , serum hdl , pcb exposure , smoking , and month of blood sampling , the association between vitamin d deficiency and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes remained unchanged ( or 1.99 [ 1.143.48 ] ; p = 0.022 ) , whereas the adjusted or for pre - existing diabetes in vitamin d deficiency was reduced considerably by similar adjustment ( or 1.48 ; p = 0.132 ) ( table 2 ) . we performed logistic regression analysis on the impact of fish dinner frequencies on the risk of type 2 diabetes . frequent fish intake ( more than twice a week ) did not appear to alter the odds of having type 2 diabetes ( or 1.09 [ 95% ci 0.641.86 ] ; p = 0.744 ) . obesity is a risk factor for vitamin d deficiency , and obese subjects had a lower serum 25(oh)d3 concentration than nonobese subjects ( 11 ) . furthermore , we have previously demonstrated in this cohort ( 11 ) that women have higher serum 25(oh)d3 concentration and tend to have lower bmi . however , we did not find any interaction between vitamin d status and sex ( p = 0.19 ) or vitamin d status and obesity ( p = 0.84 ) on risk of diabetes . statistically significant bivariate correlations were observed between serum 25(oh)d3 concentration and several indicators of glucose metabolism , including hba1c ( rs = 0.10 ; p = 0.01 ) , fasting plasma insulin ( rs = 0.10 ; p = 0.01 ) , homa - ir ( rs = 0.10 ; p = 0.01 ) , and homa - b ( r = 0.10 ; p = 0.01 ) , whereas the plasma glucose concentration ( rs = 0.01 ; p = 0.78 ) was not correlated with 25(oh)d3 concentration . however , because bmi was strongly associated with vitamin d status ( rs = 0.17 ; p < 0.0001 ) , the observed associations of 25(oh)d3 with fasting plasma insulin and the homa indexes were substantially reduced after adjustment for bmi , sex , smoking status , and serum triacylglyceride concentration , where none of them were statistically significant ( table 3 ) . however , hba1c decreased at higher serum 25(oh)d3 concentrations after adjustment (  = 0.026 , p = 0.026 ) . excluding subjects with physician - diagnosed type 2 diabetes resulted in a smaller effect that was no longer significant , probably because of reduced variation in hba1c concentration and fewer observations (  = 0.012 , p = 0.112 ) ( table 2 ) . finally , multiple regression analysis did not reveal any association between frequency of fish dinners and the hba1c concentration ( results not shown ) . unadjusted and adjusted or for type 2 diabetes in elderly faroese aged 7074 years data are or ( 95% ci ) expressed for binary traits . mmol / l ; the crude model is adjusted for sex and compares the odds of either overall type 2 diabetes ( all type 2 diabetic subjects ) , newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes ( new subjects ) , or known type 2 diabetes in subjects ( previously known subjects ) with 25(oh)d < 50 nmol / l ( reference group ) ; the adjusted model includes sex , bmi , total pcb , month of blood sampling , serum triacylglyceride concentration , serum hdl concentration , and smoking status . in this cross - sectional analysis of a population - based sample of septuagenarians , we found that the 25(oh)d3 concentration was inversely associated with the risk of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after adjustment for bmi and other established risk factors for type 2 diabetes . subjects with 25(oh)d3 concentration below 50 nmol / l had the doubled risk of newly diagnosed diabetes compared with those having higher serum concentrations . therefore , our data suggest an inverse association between the serum concentration of 25(oh)d3 and the odds of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes , thereby suggesting a protective role of vitamin d against the development of the disease , as suggested previously ( 13 ) . in further support of this association , we observed an increasing concentration of hba1c with decreasing 25(oh)d3 concentration , and this association was independent of bmi , serum triacylglycerides , smoking status , and sex . vitamin d deficiency showed a much weaker or for type 2 diabetes previously diagnosed , as could perhaps have been anticipated , given the vigorous clinical management of the disease and the longer time interval between disease development and the assessment of vitamin d status . the confidence interval for the or for the two groups of type 2 diabetes continues to overlap considerably , and therefore , the slight difference should not be overinterpreted ( table 2 ) . linear regression coefficients for the association between 25(oh)d3 and markers of glucose metabolism in elderly faroese including or excluding subjects with known diabetes * numbers vary because of varying missing sample material for each biochemical analysis . is considered an indicator of average blood glucose concentrations during the preceding 2 to 3 months and , thus , a long - term marker of glucose homeostasis ( 14 ) . abnormalities may be a result of changes in insulin secretion and insulin - stimulated uptake of glucose in muscle and fat tissue . in vitro studies and laboratory animal studies suggest possible mechanisms for the effects of the active form of vitamin d , i.e. , 1,25(oh)2d , on both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity as reviewed by pittas and dawson - hughes ( 15 ) . for instance , in mice expressing a functionally inactive mutant vitamin d receptor , blood glucose concentrations were increased and serum insulin was reduced , as was insulin mrna . pancreatic -cells express the vitamin d receptor and the enzyme 1--hydroxylase , thus suggesting that the active form of vitamin d has a functional role in these cells . even though the current study can not elucidate the likely mechanisms involved , our results appear highly plausible given the findings in experimental studies . increased fat mass adversely influences glucose metabolism , in part by increasing insulin resistance , and is also linked with lower 25(oh)d concentrations in serum ( 1618 ) . the results suggest that the negative impact of vitamin d deficiency on hba1c and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes risk is independent of increased fat mass . however , because bmi does not distinguish visceral from subcutaneous fat , some misclassification of adiposity may have occurred , thereby possibly causing some uncertainty in regard to the relative influence of serum 25(oh)d3 and adiposity in diabetes development . our study results are comparable with studies on vitamin d status and type 2 diabetes in younger populations ( 4,16,19,20 ) , and the current study extends this association to 70 years of age and older . vitamin d status is known to be lower in the elderly compared with the young as the subcutaneous synthesis of vitamin d decreases with increasing age , due to a reduced concentration of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin ( 1 ) and reduced absorption of oral vitamin d ( 8) . hence , if the relationship between vitamin d status and glucose homeostasis is causal , the age - related decline in circulating concentration of 25(oh)d may augment the increase in risk of type 2 diabetes with age . in addition , our results suggest that this relationship is not the result of increased fish intake , in agreement with the existing , somewhat equivocal evidence in regard to this effect ( 21,22 ) . these differences may be a result of variations in fish intake to inherent differences in the populations examined and the study designs . among the strengths of our study , we examined a general population sample with a high prevalence of both vitamin d deficiency ( 11 ) and type 2 diabetes . however , the current study is limited by its cross - sectional design and its single measurement of vitamin d status . nonetheless , a recent study demonstrated excellent tracking and that the correlation of serum 25(oh)d3 concentrations sampled 14 years apart was similar to that seen for other cardiovascular risk factors and that most subjects with vitamin d deficiency were still deficient 14 years later ( 23 ) . patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated hba1c concentrations are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality compared with patients with lower hba1c levels ( 24 ) . thus , clinical management focuses on glycemic control , including treatment of other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to reduce the macro- as well as microvascular complications . the inverse association between serum 25(oh)d3 and hba1c suggests that vitamin d supplementation could be considered a possible means for supporting glycemic control of type 2 diabetes . however , some intervention studies have shown inconclusive results on the effect of vitamin d on hba1c and type 2 diabetes ( 15 ) . for example , the women health s initiative demonstrated that daily supplementation with 10 g of vitamin d3 for a median follow - up time of 7 years did not reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women ( 25 ) . however , the doses used were probably too low to bring about the necessary concentrations of circulating 25(oh)d3 . therefore , further randomized clinical intervention studies are needed to elucidate the impact of vitamin d on the risk of type 2 diabetes . in summary , our study extends previous findings that a high vitamin d status protects against type 2 diabetes in younger subjects to subjects older than 70 years . likewise , our findings suggest an inverse association between hba1c and 25(oh)d3 also in the elderly . because our study has a cross - sectional design , formal confirmation requires intervention studies with appropriate doses to elucidate whether vitamin d supplementation could be used to counter the worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes . in this regard , the need to identify the necessary daily intake of vitamin d should include the possible effect on reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes , with special emphasis on the dietary needs of the elderly .","objectivevitamin d deficiency is thought to be a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes , and elderly subjects at northern latitudes may therefore be at particular risk.research design and methodsvitamin d status was assessed from serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 [ 25(oh)d3 ] in 668 faroese residents aged 7074 years ( 64% of eligible population ) . 
 we determined type 2 diabetes prevalence from past medical histories , fasting plasma concentrations of glucose , and/or glycosylated hemoglobin ( hba1c).resultswe observed 70 ( 11% ) new type 2 diabetic subjects , whereas 88 ( 13% ) were previously diagnosed . having vitamin d status 
 < 50 nmol / l doubled the risk of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after adjustment for bmi , sex , exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls , serum triacylglyceride concentration , serum hdl concentration , smoking status , and month of blood sampling . 
 furthermore , the hba1c concentration decreased at higher serum 25(oh)d3 concentrations independent of covariates.conclusionsin elderly subjects , vitamin d sufficiency may provide protection against type 2 diabetes . because the study is cross - sectional , 
 intervention studies are needed to elucidate whether vitamin d could be used to prevent development of type 2 diabetes .",287
"the fda - approved da vinci surgical system is a novel approach to perform minimally invasive surgery and is considered a  second revolution  in surgery after the introduction of laparoscopic surgery . this system was introduced in april 2003 at our institution , with 90 pediatric patients undergoing a variety of procedures performed by our surgical group . among these procedures , several reports have been published on this subject , concluding that it is a feasible , safe alternative . despite some of its potential benefits , there has yet to be any improvement shown by using the robot over the standard laparoscopic or open technique . our objective in this study was to compare results using the robot system with that of laparoscopic and open techniques in our pediatric patients to determine the potential for acceptance as a standard approach in this population . following irb approval , 150 charts of patients who underwent nissen procedures from 1994 to 2005 were divided into 3 treatment groups defined by technical approach , either robotic ( r ) ( n=50 ) , laparoscopic ( l ) ( n=50 ) , or open ( o ) ( n=50 ) . groups were case - matched and performed by several surgeons and residents , under the care of one of the 3 staff surgeons at our facility . the robot system used was the da vinci ( intuitive surgical , mountain view , ca , usa ) . the fourth arm was used in a minority of pediatric patients due to the short distance between ports leading to the restricted movement of the working arms outside the patient . we now use a 5-mm scope in addition to the 11-mm stereoscopic scope more typically used . all cases were performed with the patient in a reverse trendelenburg position under general anesthesia and complete paralysis with an age - appropriate esophageal dilator in place . port placement with the robot followed laparoscopic standards with the exception of ports being placed more distant to one another to allow broader external movements . in open cases , unless the patient had a previous midline scar , a left subcostal incision was performed . regardless of the surgical approach , once the equipment was inside the abdominal cavity , identical steps were taken to dissect the gastroesophageal junction and wrap the gastric fundus around the esophagus . descriptive and analytical statistics were applied to compare surgical times , length of hospitalization , and outcomes using kruskal - wallis and tukey tests for continuous data and the chi - square text for nominal data . in the 150 nissen cases included in this study , patients were younger and smaller in the open group ( 8555 months , 2417 kg , p<0.05 ) compared with those in the robotic ( 11764 months , 3723 kg ) and laparoscopic groups ( 10771 months , 3324 kg ) ( table 1 ) . the most common indication for the procedure was reflux refractory to medical management either as the sole reason or associated with failure to thrive or neurological impairment , or both of these [ r = 39(78% ) , l = 50(100% ) , o = 34(68% ) ] . other indications include a failed previous antireflux procedure , reflux associated with oromotor dysfunction , hiatal hernias , aspiration with an acute life - threatening event , and esophageal stricture . robot operative times proved significantly longer compared with times for laparoscopic and open procedures ( r 16061 min , l = 107 + 31 min , o = 7327 min , p<0.05 ) . the number of gastrostomy tubes done in addition to the nissen fundoplication in the robot group were similar to that of the other groups [ r = 17/50 ( 34% ) , l = 24/50 ( 48% ) , o = 11/50 ( 22% ) , p>0.05 ] . the robot group experienced 2 conversions to the open approach ( 2/50 4% ) , comparable to the laparoscopic conversion rate ( 1/50 2% ) . open cases resulted in longer hospitalization compared with the robot - assisted cases [ r = 2.944.5 d , o = 3.52.8 , p<0.05 ] . complication rates were equivalent between groups , including hiatal hernia , tight wrap requiring dilatation , and wound infection [ r = 7(14% ) , l = 8(16% ) , o = 5(10% ) , p=0.387 ] . the most common complication with the da vinci and laparoscopic approaches was a tight wrap , requiring dilatation [ r = 4/50 , 8% and l = 3/50 , 6% ] , whereas in the open series , wound infections were more common ( 2/50 , 4% ) . on 30-day follow - up , the presence of transient symptoms including dysphagia , abdominal pain , feeding aversion , and gas bloating were equivalent [ r = 15 ( 30% ) , l = 14(28% ) , o = 6(12% ) , p=0.06 ] . in our experience , the robot proved to be an acceptable approach for laparoscopic nissen fundoplication . this parallels the findings reported on early experiences from other centers . as in previous randomized trials , our experience with nissen fundoplication shows comparable efficacy of the robotic and laparoscopic approaches , with similar morbidity . the laparoscopic procedure , whether da vinci assisted or not , demonstrated a slight reduction in hospital stay compared with the open technique . patient demographics , surgical times , and complication rates according to surgical approach denotes significant difference between the robot vs. open group . of the 2 robot cases that were converted to open , one was due to intraoperative hypotension and arrhythmia and the other due to difficult dissection following failed prior repair . postoperatively , the presence of transient symptoms was similar between groups , reaching up to 30% . there was a trend towards fewer symptoms in the open group that may be due to achieving a tighter wrap in the robot and laparoscopic groups leading to more gas bloating and abdominal complaints . however , in long - term follow - up , all patients achieved symptomatic relief . the learning curve for the da vinci system played a key role in our surgical times despite previous reports . the 50 robotic cases in our study were distributed among the 3 surgical faculty and 4 pediatric surgery residents during this time . in addition to this , the robot requires several extra steps to achieve assembly in a sterile fashion and to change the instruments . we believe these factors combined would explain why the robot - assisted procedures resulted in both longer operative and total room times compared with the open series . we expect reduced surgical times once the operating surgeons overcome this 10-case learning curve and reduced setup time as well with more practice and repetition of use . therefore , like others , we have found no proven outcome benefits of using the robot in low- or medium - difficulty cases compared with the laparoscopic approach . potential benefits over standard laparoscopy include 3-dimensional image quality , camera steadiness , and the dexterity of the instrumentation for dissection and suturing . to better delineate cases that benefit most from each one of the 3 techniques , randomized prospective trials utilizing surgeons past the learning curve is required . robot - assisted surgery is equivalent to standard laparoscopic surgery in terms of complications and length of stay , with both having significantly increased operation times but reduced length of stay compared with open surgery . improved results are expected once the learning curve is overcome . however , potential outcome benefits have yet to be proven .","background : robot - assisted surgery must be evaluated before its acceptance as an option for standard therapy in the pediatric population . 
 our objective is a comparison of results using the robot system with results for the laparoscopic and open approaches.methods:following irb approval , robot - assisted procedures were case - matched with controls , selected from 1994 to 2005 . 
 data for 150 nissen cases were divided equally into 3 groups [ robot ( r ) , laparoscopic ( l ) , and open ( o ) ] , comparing surgical times , length of hospitalization , and outcomes.results:the average age ( r = 11764 months , l = 10771 months , o = 8555 months , p<0.05 ) and weight ( r = 3723 kg , l = 3324 kg , o = 2417 kg , p<0.05 ) of the open group were lower comparatively . 
 robot operative times proved significantly longer compared with laparoscopic and open time ( r = 16061 min , l = 107 + 31 min , o = 7327 min , p<0.05 ) . 
 the robot had 2 conversions ( 2/50 , 4% ) , comparable to the laparoscopic conversion rate ( 1/50 , 2% ) . 
 open cases resulted in longer hospitalization [ r = 2.944.5 days , l = 3.547.8 days , o = 3.52.8 , p<0.05 ] . 
 complication rates were equivalent between groups . 
 the most common complication with the da vinci and laparoscopic approaches was tight wrap requiring dilation [ r = 4/50 ( 8% ) and l = 3/50 ( 6%)].conclusion : robot - assisted surgery is equivalent to standard laparoscopic surgery in terms of complications and length of stay , with both having significantly increased operation times but reduced length of stay compared with open surgery . 
 further experience with this technology is needed to overcome the learning curve and reduce operative times .",421
"the world health organization considers leishmaniasis as one of the most neglected tropical diseases which has received little attention and resources despite its serious impacts on both the economic developments and quality of life ( who 2012 ) . leishmaniasis is one of the most important vector - borne disease and public health problem in iran that transmitted by sandflies to human and other animals . the main visceral foci are located in ardabil ( northwest ) and fars ( southwest ) . cutaneous leishmaniasis is the main vector - borne disease in the country with an average of more than 22,000 cases in the last decade ( karimi et al . 2014 ) , about 80% of them are zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis ( zcl ) , the endemic foci of this type are in rural areas of 17 out of 31 province ( yaghoobi - ershadi 2012 , karimi et al . zcl is a disease that primarily uses animals such as rodents as reservoir hosts ( mirzaei et al . humans are an accidental host that can be involved in the transmission cycle of leishmania parasites ( rouhani et al . geographically , zcl is widely distributed in africa , the middle east , central asia , and the rajasthan area of india ( rouhani et al . 2014 ) . in iran based on animal reservoir host , there are four foci of disease in our country : the first one has been located in central and northeast of iran , where rhombomys opimus and phlebotomus papatasi play important roles as reservoir and vector of the disease . the second focus of zcl is located in the west and southwest of iran , where tatera indica replaced with r. opimus as a reservoir and p. papatasi as a vector . baluchistan province , in the southeast of iran is considered as the third focus of zcl . in this region meriones hurrianae has been approved as a natural reservoir host . from the reported evidences , it is apparent that the most rural areas of provinces in central and southern iran can be considered as the zcl focus where m. libycus is the primary and main reservoir host of the disease , while r. opimus and t. indica were absent and p. papatasi is considered as the proven vector of zcl ( yaghoobi - ershadi et al . golestan province is one of the well - known foci of zcl in iran and two counties of this province are famous : gonbad - e - kavoos and maraveh tapeh that located in north and northeastern of this province . in one study carried out in gonbad - e - kavoos county , 4% of population have acute ulcer and 78% scar and in other study in maraveh tapeh county the prevalence of acute ulcer and scare rate were 3.03% and 63.7% respectively ( sofizadeh 2007 , cherabin et al . many researchers have argued that r. opimus and m. libycus are reservoir hosts of zcl and p. papatasi is the main vector of this disease in golestan province ( rassi et al . the main aim of this study was to determine relation between rodents active burrows and incidence of zcl in golestan province using spatial analysis . a cross - sectional study was carried out in golestan province from february 2013 to march 2014 . golestan province is located ( 3738n and 5458 e ) in northeastern of iran and is bounded by caspian sea and mazandaran province in the west , semnan province in the south , north khorasan province in the east and a borderline with turkmenistan in the north ( fig 1 ) . most parts of golestan province are plain and more than 2/3 of the plain area has arid and semiarid climates and 1/3 of others have a mild climate . the area of the province is 20437.74 km ( 1.3 areas of iran ) with 1823117 population . there are 14 counties , 27 districts , 60 rural districts , 25 cities and 1732 villages in golestan province . maximum and minimum of temperatures were recorded as 40.8 and 02 c respectively and the mean annual relative humidity was recorded as 74% . the total annual rainfall was 772 mm and the minimum precipitation in august and maximum in february . location of study area , golestan province in iran three villages were randomly selected in all rural districts ( 60 ) of golestan province and the number of active rodents burrows were counted in area of one hectare . furthermore , all villages with positive human cases in 2013 were obtained regardless of the number of cases reported from each village maps of the spatial distribution of the disease were prepared using gis software . the number of human positive cases in each rural districts of the province , as well as the incidence of disease were calculated . for calculating , the incidence rate of the disease , we used population at risk in the denominator . the relationship between the number of rodents active burrows with incidence rate and the number of positive cases of disease in rural districts were calculated using spss software version 13 and sperman test . a cross - sectional study was carried out in golestan province from february 2013 to march 2014 . golestan province is located ( 3738n and 5458 e ) in northeastern of iran and is bounded by caspian sea and mazandaran province in the west , semnan province in the south , north khorasan province in the east and a borderline with turkmenistan in the north ( fig 1 ) . most parts of golestan province are plain and more than 2/3 of the plain area has arid and semiarid climates and 1/3 of others have a mild climate . the area of the province is 20437.74 km ( 1.3 areas of iran ) with 1823117 population . there are 14 counties , 27 districts , 60 rural districts , 25 cities and 1732 villages in golestan province . maximum and minimum of temperatures were recorded as 40.8 and 02 c respectively and the mean annual relative humidity was recorded as 74% . the total annual rainfall was 772 mm and the minimum precipitation in august and maximum in february . three villages were randomly selected in all rural districts ( 60 ) of golestan province and the number of active rodents burrows were counted in area of one hectare . furthermore , all villages with positive human cases in 2013 were obtained regardless of the number of cases reported from each village maps of the spatial distribution of the disease were prepared using gis software . the number of human positive cases in each rural districts of the province , as well as the incidence of disease were calculated . for calculating , the incidence rate of the disease , we used population at risk in the denominator . the relationship between the number of rodents active burrows with incidence rate and the number of positive cases of disease in rural districts were calculated using spss software version 13 and sperman test . among all counties of golestan province , the highest incidence rate of the disease were observed in moravehtappeh ( 121.5/100000 ) and gonbad kavoos ( 99.3/100000 ) respectively ( table 1 ) . these two counties were endemic foci of cl in golestan province . in the rest of counties , demographic characters of zcl in golestan province ( 2013 ) the highest ( 53.8% ) and lowest ( 11.5% ) of cl cases were observed in the age groups of  14 and 1 years old respectively ( table . it should be noted that , 60.2 % of patients were male . in the assess the existence of rodent 's active burrows in a radius of 300 meters from the villages , they were found only in the rural districts of gonbad kavoos and moraveh tappeh counties . in the rest of studied districts , there were not rodent 's active burrows , or were located at a distance of one kilometer of the villages . however , the maximum number of rodent 's active burrows was observed in rural district of korand in gonbad kavoos county ( fig . 2 ) . distribution of rodent 's active burrows in golestan province , 2013 the number of positive cases as well as the incidence of disease were calculated 0100/100000 and 035/100000 in the different rural districts of golestan province respectively . it must be mentioned , similar to rodent 's active burrows , the most positive cases and the highest incidence of disease were found in rural district of korand in gonbad kavoos county ( fig . 2 , 3 ) . number of positive cases of zcl in golestan province , 2013 based on the statistical analysis of data , there were significant difference between the number of rodent 's active burrows with the number of positive cases ( 0.465 , p < 0.001 ) as well as , the incidence of disease ( 0.470 , p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) . the most positive cases were found in the northern villages of plain areas in october and november ( figs . 4 , 6 ) . incidence of zcl in golestan province , 2013 trend of zcl cases in golestan province ( 2013 ) spatial distribution of zcl cases in golestan province ( 2013 ) there was a significant positive correlation between the number of rodent 's active burrows and incidence of disease as well as the number of positive cases in studied areas ( 0.470 , p < 0.001 ) . according to fig . based on literature review of cutaneous leishmaniasis in golestan province , the causative agent of disease ( zcl ) was l. major and p. papatsi has been reported as the principal vector to human . two rodents of r. opimus and m. lybicus were main and secondary reservoir host of disease respectively ( rassi et al . 2008 , parvizi and hedayati 2010 , roshanghalb and parvizi 2012 , bordbar and parvizi 2014 ) . since the sand flies are often active in a distance of 200 meters from its habitats ( rassi and hanafi bojd 2006 ) , therefore , the presence of rodents burrows , one kilometer from the village , are considered as one of the risk factors of disease transmission . based on the results of our study , the active rodents burrows were only observed in rural districts of maraveh tappeh and gonbad - e kavoos counties . the previous studies have demonstrated that two species of r. opimus and m. libycus , are chosen the plains with soft soil to build their colonies under bushes and along streams ( nadim et al . 2009 ) , so , in the rural district of palizan to centroid qazanqaya village ( 561528.686e 375531.132n ) due to the rocky nature of area as well as , in the rural districts of shalami to centroid arab qari haji village ( 55458.727e 374123.994n ) and golidagh to centroid golidagh village ( 555641.944e 373841.094n ) due to the mountainous nature of the region , no rodent burrows were observed . we found several active burrows with high population of rodents in both rural districts of the korand to centroid korand village ( 55315.842e 37 5751.47n ) and atrak to centroid dashliburun village ( 544845.653e 373757.254n ) located in gonbad - e kavoos county . in the rural districts of agh - abad to centroid agh - abad village ( 551426.891e 371814.929n ) and sultan ali to centroid sultan ali village ( 5537.15e 37144.863n ) in some villages , the rodents were active with low abundance . in the tamran rural district to centroid tamer ghare ghozi village ( 552955.568e 372951.35n ) located at the kalaleh county , there was no rodent burrows at a distance of one kilometer from the villages . also , in the rest counties of golestan province , no rodent 's active burrows were observed nearby villages . based on our study , there were high correlation between the number of rodent 's active burrows with the number of positive cases ( 0.465 , p < 0.001 ) as well as , the incidence of disease ( 0.470 , p < 0.001 ) . this was due to the abundance of active wild rodents as the reservoir of disease and vicinity of their colonies to human settlements . therefore , high number of positive cases as well as high incidence of disease were observed in the rural districts of moravehtappeh ( moravehtappeh county ) and korand and also atrak in gonbad kavoos county . it should be noted that , two rural districts of agh - abad and sultan - ali in gonbad kavoos county were in the second rank of positive human cases . all positive cases in other rural districts of the province were imported cases , due their business trip to endemic areas . evaluation forms for these patients revealed that in most counties , the patients had a history of traveling to endemic areas of disease including rural districts of maraveh tapeh , atrak or korand . some patients had also at least one travel to the provinces of semnan , khorasan and isfahan . for example , the number of 20 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis had been reported from the district of south fenderesk to centroid dar kalateh village ( 545738.738e 365758.499n ) located at the county of ramian , they were workers of brick kilns , who had traveled to the province of semnan in the early spring and had returned to their homes in the early autumn of 2013 . the highest incidences of the disease were found in the counties of maravehtappeh and gonbad kavoos counties respectively , while the high number of positive cases were observed in the second county . because the most population of the maraveh tappeh county ( 43.1% ) were living in endemic areas and were at greater risk of the disease , while in the county of gonbad - e kavoos county about 15% of the population were living in endemic areas . the hightest ( 53.8% ) and lowest ( 11.5% ) of cl cases were observed in the age groups of > 14 and < 1 respectively ( table 1 ) . whereas most patients ( 53.8% ) were adults over 14 years old , these results were similar to studies conducted in maraveh tapeh and gonbad - e kavoos countis in this province ( cherabin et al . 2012 , sofizadeh et al . 2013 ) and in the rural districts of damghan , and kasahan in the provinces of semnan and isfahan respectively ( doroodgar et al . 2009 , mohammadi azni et al . 2010 ) . the lowest morbidity rate of disease ( 11.5% ) was observed in age group of 1 years old . this age group had the lowest presence in outdoors and considering to hypoendemic of disease in studied areas ( sofizadeh et al . our study showed , the males are infected more than females ( 60.2% ) . because , the males are busy in agriculture tasks outside of home during the nights of summer and attending to active peak of sand flies ( sofizadeh et al . 2009 ) they have received more infected bites . the greatest number of cases were occurred in the months of october and november and coincided with the second peak of sand flies in september ( sofizadeh 2009 ) . due to direct relation between the number of rodent 's burrows and the incidence of disease , we propose to use different methods of reodent control as complementary measure for the control of disease . results of current study indicated the direct relationship between the burrows of rodents and zcl prevalence . therefore the presences of rodents as the reservoir host of disease play an important role on prevalence as well as incidence rate of disease . considering this , control of rodents will have an important role in controlling the disease . the other point that we need to pay attention , do actions that take more than a kilometer distance between human and the rodent 's life places .","background : zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis ( zcl ) is one of the most important vector - borne diseases in iran . 
 wild rodents play as a reservoir . 
 the main aim of this study was to determine spatial analyses of the relationship between rodent 's active burrows and incidence of zcl in golestan province , north east of iran.methods:the cross - sectional study was conducted in 59 rural districts in golestan province . 
 spatial distribution of rodent 's active burrows , human cases of zcl and incidence of disease were collected , using geographical information systems ( gis ) . 
 the relationship of them were analyzed by sperman test , spss software version no.13.results:the most number of rodents active burrows , human positive cases ( 100 persons ) and high incidence of disease ( 35/1000 ) were observed in korand rural district of gonbad - e kavoos county . 
 there was significant correlation between the number of rodents active burrows with incidence rate of disease ( 0.470 , p < 0.001 ) as well as the number of cases in each districts ( 0.465 , p < 0.001 ) , there is high correlation between higher incidence rate and human positive cases in districts with number of rodents active burrows.conclusion:vicinity of wild rodents burrows to villages plays an important role in transmission of zcl to humans .",291
"development of the central nervous system ( cns ) is a complex process , which requires integration of many cellular processes including neural stem cell proliferation , migration , and neuronal differentiation . the major neuronal migration occurs in humans between the 12th and the 24th weeks of gestation and results in the formation of the cortical plate . however , the cortex continues to develop , and late migrations from the germinal matrix into the cerebral cortex continue until five months postnatally . classification of neuronal migration disorders is based on morphological criteria and includes schizenccphaly , porencephaly , lissencephaly , argyria , macrogyria , pachygyria , microgyria , and micropolygyria . pathogenesis of these malformations is multifactorial and includes genetic factors and environmental agents . in recent years few epidemiological studies have addressed the impact of prenatal exposures , although several maternal factors such as use of ethanol or drugs , viral infections , maternal diabetes , and untreated phenylketonuria can potentially influence the neuronal migration . the aim of this population - based study was to describe perinatal characteristics in infants diagnosed with neuronal migration disorders aiming at identifying potential risk factors . the infants included in the study were identified as those hospitalized with a diagnosis related to a neuronal migration abnormality and confirmed by a computer tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . all swedish residents are assigned a unique 12-digit national registration number , which is used for official population - based registers . this number makes it possible to identify individuals and collect certain information within registers and also to link information between different registers . the inpatient register is held by the national board of health and welfare , and it records information concerning hospitalizations , including date of admission and discharge and primary and secondary diagnoses together with the national registration number . from 1987 and the swedish medical birth register was established in 1973 and includes data on more than 99% of all births in sweden . a standardized set of medical records is used by all antenatal care clinics and delivery units and at the examination of the newborn infant . selected information from the records is computerized and forwarded to the register , which is held by the national board of health and welfare . for all births , medical information on maternal demographic data , the reproductive history , maternal smoking habits , the registration starts at the first visit to the antenatal clinic and is completed when the mother and newborn infant are discharged from the hospital . the records , which include copies of referrals for radiologic examinations , were used to identify the children who had been examined with ct or mri and to validate the diagnosis of a neuronal migration disorder . information concerning factors that might influence neuronal migration disorders was obtained through the swedish medical birth register . for the mothers we obtained information about age , body mass index at first antenatal visit ( bmi , calculated as maternal weight in kilograms at first visit to the antenatal clinic / maternal height times height ) , chronic diseases prior to index pregnancy , reproductive history ( parity , years of infertility ) , and smoking in early pregnancy . bmi was classified according to who definition as underweight < 18.5  kg / m , normal weight 18.5  kg / m and < 25  kg / m , overweight 25  kg / m and < 30  kg / m , and obesity 30  kg / m . smoking was classified as no smoking , smoking 19 cigarettes / day , and > 10 cigarettes per day . we also obtained information on maternal diseases during pregnancy and mode of delivery ( noninstrumental and instrumental vaginal delivery and emergency and elective cesarean section ) . as chronic diseases we included kidney failure , celiac disease , epilepsy , ulcerative colitis , diabetes mellitus , asthma , and systemic lupus erythematosus . the information was retrieved by the international classification of diseases as icd-9 or icd-10 codes , and all icd-9 codes were manually transformed into icd-10 codes . for the infants we obtained information on sex , gestational age at birth , birth weight and birth length , and the apgar scores at one and five minutes . small for gestational age ( sga ) was defined as birth weight more than 2 standard deviations ( sds ) below the mean birth weight for gestational age and sex according to a swedish birth weight curve . appropriate for gestational age ( aga ) was defined as a birth weight between 2  sd and + 2  sd and large for gestational age ( lga ) as a birth weight more than 2  sd above the mean . all infants born alive from 1980 through 1999 and diagnosed with a neuronal migration disorder according to mri or ct scan sometime during this period were eligible for inclusion in the study . a total of 820 infants had been hospitalized with a diagnosis such as congenital myopathies and malformations of the cns that could be related to a neuronal migration disorder ( icd 9 : 359.1 - 359.24 , 742.1 - 24 , 759.23 , and icd 10 : q 040.0 - 89.9 , g 71.2 ) . we requested information on performed ct or mri scans by a letter sent to all paediatric and radiological clinics in the country , and about half of the 47 clinics responded to our request . in 120 of the patients , the diagnosis of neuronal migration was confirmed by the local radiologist in 17 subjects , 9 boys and 8 girls , all of whom were included in the study . as the study was purely descriptive , no formal testing was possible . for certain characteristics ( maternal age , bmi , gestational age at birth , and birth weight ) , the mother 's median age was 29 years , and most women were born in sweden ( table 1 ) . one of the mothers was underweight with a bmi below 19 at the start of pregnancy , and none was obese . the mean bmi of the mothers at first antenatal visit was 21.3 ( range 17.628.5 ) . one woman suffered from chronic multifocal osteomyelitis and necrosis and another was involved in a motorbike accident . maternal care for ( suspected ) damage to the fetus by radiation was reported in one case . nine male infants and eight female infants were born after mean 39.3 gestational weeks and with a mean birth weight of 3327 grams . all children were born as singletons and were aga , and all had a full apgar score . most infants were classified to have an undefined migrational disorder , a disturbed migration of the immature brain or a migrational disorder of unknown type . congenital malformations of the spleen or the heart , potter 's syndrome , and facial asymmetry were reported , including malformation of the eye and lens , microphthalmus , and cleft palate . two infants had skin problems at birth , and one infant suffered from obstruction of the intestine by gallstones or meconium ( table 2 ) . all infants were born at term and of ordinary birth weight to healthy mothers with normal or subnormal bmi and after normal pregnancies . most of the infants had a concomitant malformation , and two infants were diagnosed with congenital rubella infections . the use of modern techniques of brain imaging , especially mri , has dramatically improved the ability to detect these neurological disorders while the child is still alive . over 25 syndromes related to disturbances of neuronal migration . the incidence of disturbances of the neuronal migration is not known , but is increasing in the pediatric population probably due to the use of mri techniques for brain imaging . epidemiological studies and experimental data have demonstrated the importance of nutritional factors in fetal brain development and the deleterious effects of nutritional deficits [ 911 ] . bmi was recorded for 12 of the women in the study , and more than half of them had subnormal or near subnormal bmi at start of pregnancy . since 1992 maternal bmi has been recorded in sweden at the first antenatal visit , and an increase from 23 to 24 in mean bmi was noted between 1992 and 2002 . one can speculate whether the generally lower bmi among these 12 mothers of infants with neuronal migration disorder , as compared to the general pregnant population might have influenced the fetal brain development . however , it was not possible to calculate the adjusted association between maternal bmi and risk of neuronal migrations disorder in this small descriptive study . the impact of maternal bmi at start of pregnancy and/or weight gain during pregnancy on the fetal brain development and neuronal migration needs to be evaluated in a larger study . it is well known that maternal diseases during pregnancy , such as diabetes and nontreated phenylketonuria , and conditions where the placental blood flow is reduced , such as preeclampsia , could interfere with the fetal brain development [ 1 , 9 , 13 , 14 ] . even a less severe maternal hypothyroidism during the first half of gestation might affect the fetal neurodevelopment and neuronal migration . few studies have addressed the impact on maternal health on specific migration disorders . in our study however , conditions related to an abnormal pregnancy and conditions which all can cause suboptimal growth conditions for the fetus were reported in four women . neuronal migration disorders have been described in humans and/or in animal models following in utero exposures to infections . some viruses , such as herpes simples , cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , or hiv , are potentially capable to persist in a latent form within the central nervous system . several studies have described the teratogenic effect of cmv infection and the relation to neuronal migration disorders [ 1618 ] . adverse impacts of maternal infections due to rubella , group b streptococcus , cytomegalovirus , toxoplasmosis , and chorioamnionitis in the fetal brain are known . however , two children were reported with rubella syndrome at birth , which is more than expected . the percentage of susceptible pregnant women with rubella was gradually reduced from 12% in 1975 to just below 2% in 1994 . rubella syndrome is very uncommon , and between 1975 and 1985 , only a mean of two cases per year were recorded in sweden . since 1985 , no child with the rubella syndrome has been registered . it can be speculated that rubella had an impact on the neuronal migration in two cases in this study . it is well known that maternal smoking increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction and affects the fetal brain by inducing intrauterine hypoxia or by acting directly on the developing brain [ 2123 ] . smoking habits among women have changed over time in sweden . during the 1960s as many as 25% of the women smoked , this was reduced to 14% in 2004 . in this study 23% of the women smoked , which was more than in the general pregnant population during this time period . the detection of cases was difficult mainly because of our strict criteria for eligibility , which included a ct or mri scan confirming the diagnosis . in 120 of all hospitalized children , a ct or mri scan of the brain was preformed , and only 17 of them were confirmed with a neuronal migration disorder . despite several reminders , only 50% of all hospitals in sweden responded to our request to send in ct and mri scans . none of the hospitals actively rejected participation in the study . the cause of this dropout is not known but was evenly distributed between level i , ii , and iii hospitals over the country . it can be speculated that journals from the study period were not easily found , and the time for searching these journals was regarded as too expensive for the hospitals . the study refers to a time of great medical advances , and the use of ct and mri scan is more widely used today . the cases were identified through the national patient register , and the responding hospitals were evenly spread over the country . considering the increasing use of ct and mri scans , a study performed in more recent years might detect more children with neuronal migration disorder . this descriptive study indicates that there might be an impact of low or subnormal maternal bmi before and during pregnancy , maternal infection , such as rubella , and maternal smoking on fetal brain development , including neuronal migration . the roles of maternal bmi and congenital infections should be tested in future analytical studies .","the development of the central nervous system is complex and includes dorsal and ventral induction , neuronal proliferation , and neuronal migration , organization , and myelination . 
 migration occurs in humans in early fetal life . 
 pathogenesis of malformations of the central nervous system includes both genetic and environmental factors . 
 few epidemiological studies have addressed the impact of prenatal exposures . 
 all infants born alive and included in the swedish medical birth register 19801999 were included in the study . by linkage to the patient register , 
 820 children with a diagnosis related to a neuronal migration abnormality were identified . through copies of referrals for computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain , the diagnosis was confirmed in 17 children . 
 median age of the mothers was 29 years . at the start of pregnancy , four out of 17 women smoked . 
 almost half of the women had a body mass index that is low or in the lower range of average . 
 all infants were born at term with normal birth weights . 
 thirteen infants had one or more concomitant diseases or malformations . 
 two infants were born with rubella syndrome . the impact of low maternal body mass index and congenital infections on neuronal migration disorders in infants should be addressed in future studies .",251
"they give rise to all the other major brain cell types , which include oligodendrocytes , astrocytes , and neurons . however , molecular pathways , which are complicated and control the proliferation and differentiation of nscs , have been characterized incompletely to date . there is multiple indirect evidence suggesting a critical role of mirnas in nscs [ 47 ] . post - transcriptional control mediated by mirnas was identified as a further important regulation level , especially in neural proliferation where the action of these negative modulators of gene expression is pervasive . mirnas are small single - stranded non - coding rnas molecules which participate in the transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes and produce biological effects through inhibiting translation or destabilizing target mrnas [ 1012 ] . mirnas act as vital adjusters in multiple biological processes , including cell metabolism , differentiation , proliferation , and apoptosis . mir-126 is highly enriched in endothelial cells and previous studies found that mir-126 plays critical roles in vascular integrity and can promote angiogenesis during embryonic development [ 1518 ] . reported that the expression level of mir-126 was downregulated after spinal cord injury and that it can promote angiogenesis and attenuate inflammation in rats . however , the effects of mir-126 in nscs is still unclear ; therefore , we intended to study its role in nscs proliferation and survival . the immortalized human nsc lines hb1.f3 and hb1.a4 were maintained with dulbecco s modified eagle s medium ( dmem , sigma ) containing 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) . total rna was extracted from cell lines with a mirvanamirna isolation kit ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer s instructions . the expression level of mir-126 was detected by qrt - pcr according to the taqman mirna assays protocol ( applied biosystems ) and normalized by u6 small nuclear rna ( rnu6b ; applied biosystems ) with the 2 method . lv3-pglv - h1-gfp+puro plasmids with mir-126 mimics and negative control ( lv -

"the investigation of the structural - functional organization of chromatin in situ using conventional transmission electron microscopy has been hindered by a number of technical limitations . the major handicap derives from the fact that in most electron microscopy preparations , the agents employed for thin - section contrasting render electron - opaque , together with the deoxyribonucleoprotein , many other different intermingled substances , which masks the morphology of the chromatin structures . therefore , very little in situ data have been produced on chromatin structural organization and its functionally related changes . however , valuable information has been obtained from studies applying a highly selective and specific staining method for dna , the feulgen - like osmium ammine technique . this staining procedure , introduced by cogliati and gautier , contributed to electron microscopy by exclusively visualizing the dna - containing structures , thus allowing a study of the chromatin organization down to the molecular level in thin sections of samples fixed in situ . for this reason , it is of interest to review these in situ studies , even though obtained some years ago , and to discuss them in the light of recent results on the chromatin structural - functional organization , coming from investigations conducted using different technical approaches . in fact , comparisons of these data may help to shed light on topics which are still debated , such as : the relationship between chromosome territories and the interchromatin space within the interphase cell nucleus ; the structure of chromatin fibres ( i.e. , whether with a diameter of 10 or 30 nm ) ; the structure of transcriptionally - active and inactive chromatin . a brief description of the characteristics of the feulgen - like technique for the visualization of dna - containing structures at the electron microscope level and its potential for studying both gross and fine chromatin structure in situ will be discussed first . in 1973 cogliati and gautier proposed a staining procedure for the visualization of the dna - containing structures at the electron microscope level . this method was based on a feulgen - like reaction which utilizes an electron - opaque osmium - ammine complex as a schiff - like reagent . the classic schiff reagent is a solution of pararosaniline chloride ( red - purple coloured ) rendered colourless by so2 exposure , which after reacting with aldehyde groups , restored to the red - purple colour of pararosaniline . this reagent is used for cytochemical detection of substances in which aldehyde groups are generated either by mild hydrochloric acid hydrolysis ( e.g. , dna in the feulgen reaction ) or by periodic acid treatment ( e.g. , glycoconjugates in the pas reaction ) . the osmium - ammine complex prepared by cogliati and gautier , and in a more reproducible protocol established by olins et al . , behaves as a schiff reagent in the presence of so2 by reacting with aldehyde groups produced in the feulgen and in the periodic acid schiff ( pas ) reaction , rendering electron opaque with high selectivity and specificity the dna- and the glycoconjugate - containing structures in thin sections . for the selective staining of the dna or the glycoconjugate - containing structures , the staining reaction works on thin sections derived from routinely dehydrated and resin - embedded samples . the high selectivity for dna and glyconjugates of the osmium - ammine - so2 staining in the feulgen and in the pas reaction , respectively , has been demonstrated . in thin section of mammalian cells , only the dna - containing structures are rendered electron - opaque in the feulgen - like reaction whereas the cytoplasmic organelles exhibit very low electron opacity . in the nucleus , all the ribonu - cleoprotein components remain unstained ( supplementary figure 1a ) . after periodic acid pre - treatment the staining reaction allows selective visualization of substances containing a high proportion of carbohydrate macromolecules such as glycogen , glycoprotein and proteoglycans ; whereas dna - containing structures are not rendered electron - opaque ( supplementary figure 1b ) . for more complete information on the osmium - ammine complex as a schiff - like reagent in electron microscopy the first studies conducted using osmium - ammine staining in the feulgen - like reaction allowed easy distinguishing of condensed heterochromatin from dispersed euchromatin of mammalian cell nuclei in situ and clearly established the gross ultrastructural morphology of transcriptionally - active chromatin . it has been shown that chromatin organization depends on the metabolic state on the cell , more precisely on rna polymerase ii transcriptional activity . in cells with a moderate rna polymerase ii - mediated transcriptional activity , such as resting rat hepatocytes , a significant portion of chromatin is condensed in electron - dense masses , well separated from the completely electron - translucent nucleoplasmic space , the interchromatin compartment ( figure 1a ) . thinner chromatin threads appear to branch out for a short length from the periphery of the chromatin masses . on the contrary , in highly transcriptionally - active cells , such as regenerating rat hepatocytes , chromatin appears mainly in a very dispersed form , constituting a network of interwoven threads uniformly distributed through the nucleoplasmic space . very small clumps of condensed chromatin are associated with the inner nuclear membrane and sparsely distributed in the nucleoplasm ( figure 1b ) . selective inhibition of rna polymerase ii activity by -amanitin causes highly dispersed chromatin to compact into electron dense masses , thus increasing the interchromatin space completely devoid of chromatin structures ( figure 2 ) . the dispersion of the chromatin clumps , with the increased occupancy of the interchromatin space that accompanies the progressive increase in rna polymerase ii - mediated transcriptional activity , is particularly striking in human circulating lymphocytes stimulated to proliferate by phytohemagglutinin ( figure 3a - c ) . these observations indicate that chromosomes during interphase are highly plastic structures and that the relationship between chromatin and the interchromatin space is highly variable depending upon rna transcription and cell cycle phases . the chromatin and the inter - chromatin compartment appear to be clearly segregated only in the case of low nuclear transcriptional activity , whereas in cells with up - regulated synthesis of mrnas a clear compartmentalization is not detected . these findings may ameliorate the differences between models proposed for the relationship between the chromatin and interchromatin compartment in interphase cell nucleus . evidence supports that after mitosis the compact chromosomes , even though they undergo marked decondensation , still occupy distinct regions , the chromosomes territories , within the interphase nucleus . the inter - chromatin domain contains proteins and ribonucleoproteins which constitute the nuclear machinery necessary for nucleic acid synthesis and processing . from an ultrastructural point of view one model , proposed by cremer and cremer , suggests that the chromosomes territories are separated by the interchromatin domain , which are almost devoid of dna , and that transcriptionally - active genes are located at the periphery of a given chromosome territory , where they constitute a thin layer , the perichromatin region , in which extended chromatin fibers and rna transcripts intermingle . the other model , proposed by branco and pombo , argues that chromatin from different chromosomes is not separated by the interchromatin domain . rather , the chromatin structures form a lattice - like network of fibers which intermingle in an uniform way within individual chromosome territory and between different chromosome territories . a defined perichromatin region is excluded , rna transcription taking place everywhere within the chromatin domains . thus , this model does not support the compartmentalization in chromosomes territories , interchromatin domain and perichromatin region . indeed , the data obtained using the osmium - ammine feulgen - like reaction suggest that the model of the chromosome territories , interchromatin domain and perichromatin region compartmentalization may be more valid for nuclei characterized by a low rna transcription rate in which a clear compartmentalization in chromatin domains and the interchromatin space is present . this appears not to be the case for cells characterized by an enhanced transcription rate . in such cells , chromatin constitutes a diffuse network uniformly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm , with all the nucleoplasmic components intermingled together and the consequent loss of any obvious compartmentalization . also , ultrastructural data coming from the preferential visualization of the ribonucleoprotein components using the uranyl - edta - lead staining procedure were consistent with the apparent presence of three different compartments in the nuclei of resting cells and with the loss of this compartmentalization in cells with an enhanced pol ii transcriptional activity . this is clearly visible in supplementary figure 2 a , b showing a resting and a regenerating rat hepatocyte , respectively . it appears that , depending on the transcriptional activity of the cells , the organization of the nuclear compartments can be consistent with one or the other model . however it is worth noting that , whereas the cremer and cremer model can be consistent also with a modulation of chromatin architecture from resting cells ( characterized by a low rna transcription rate ) to proliferating cells ( characterized by a high rna transcription rate ) , just by expanding the perichromatin region , the branco and pombo model can not justify the chromatin compartmentalization in cells with a low rna transcription rate , being in fact applicable only to highly transcriptionally active cells . in the late 20 century there were major achievements in the study of chromatin structure and function derived from investigations conducted using isolated chromatin that was subjected to treatment with detergents , different ionic strength solutions and metal cation concentrations , and to nuclease digestion . many years ago these studies led to the discovery that chromatin was constituted by repeating units , the nucleosomes , made up of histones and dna , thus opening new scenarios for the understanding of the structural organization of dna in chromatin and of the mechanisms controlling gene expression . visualization of nucleosomes in situ was obtained using the osmium - ammine staining in the feulgen - like reaction . in fact , this staining procedure was found to possess high resolution of the stained structures in thin sections , thus allowing a clear visualization of dna filaments ( as thin as the 2 - 3 nm dna double helix molecule ) and visualization of nucleosomes in thin sections of mammalian cells routinely processed for electron microscopy . the nucleosome is composed by a histone octamer , two each of histones h2a , h2b , h3 and h4 , which constitute a protein core around which 147 base pairs of dna are wrapped in 1.7 left - handed super - helical turns ; histone h1 is attached to the complex . ultrastructurally , nucleosomes are flat cylinders with a diameter of 11 nm and with a height of 5.5 nm . therefore , after the feulgen - like osmium - ammine reaction , since only dna is stained , the particles appear as small rings , with a diameter of about 11 nm , constituted by electron - opaque thin filament , about 3 nm thick ( corresponding to the thickness of double helix dna filament ) , delineating an unstained inner core . the observation of these ring - shaped structures is obviously limited to those portions of chromatin where the electron beam is perpendicular to the diameter of the nucleosomes . moreover , nucleosomes in thin sections of chromatin fixed in situ do not lie in the same plane , but in fact ( given the thickness of sections that range from 50 - 80 nm ) they may be distributed on overlapping planes . thus , section thickness and varying orientations of the chromatin reduces a generalized visualization of the ring - shaped particles . nevertheless , they can be frequently recognized both in the extended fibres of the dispersed chromatin ( compare figure 4a , in which nucleosomes are shown in a spread chromatin preparation , with figure 4b , showing a dispersed in situ chromatin fibre ) and within the small clumps and the masses of highly condensed chromatin ( figure 4c , d ) . measurements of the diameter of clearly recognizable ring - shaped particles ( performed on micrographs with an original magnification of 50,000 and photographically enlarged to 175,000 ) resulted in a mean value of 110.8 nm ( s.d . ) with a range from 9.5 to 13.0 nm , strongly suggesting their identification with nucleosomes . after the discovery of the nucleosomal organization of chromatin in 1974 , a series of investigations were conducted using different methological approaches in order to determine whether the nucleosomal filament ( in the remainder of this article the nucleosomal filament will be described as an 11-nm fiber ) gives rise to higher order structures for dna compaction within interphase and metaphase chromosomes . these studies , conducted in vitro , lead to the conviction that the nucleosome filament , the first level of dna compaction , was further folded into a 30 nm chromatin fiber , that was considered to represent the basic unit of interphase chromatin . furthermore , 30 nm chromatin fibres were visualised in isolated mitotic chromosomes swollen in low salt solution , in starfish sperm intact nuclei and in polytene chromosome puffs after inhibition of transcription . this firm belief of the existence of 30 nm chromatin fibers was questioned by a series of studies conducted in recent years using different approaches to visualize chromatin in situ . using cryo - electron microscopy and image processing of vitreous sections of human mitotic chromosomes , it was possible to demonstrate that mitotic chromatin exhibited a homogeneous grainy texture , in which there were no visible 30-nm fibers , but the bulk of compact chromatin existed in a highly disordered and interdigitated state , comparable with a polymer melt . furthermore , the application of the electron spectroscopic imaging ( esi ) technique to the study of chromatin structure allowed the visualization in situ of 10 nm thick chromatin fibres even in compact chromatin domains known as condensed heterochromatin . these esi data indicated that a large portion of chromatin in mammalian cell nuclei was organized in 10 nm thick fibers . indeed , very recently using cryo - electron microscopy and synchrotron x - ray scattering , it was shown that human mitotic hela chromosomes were composed mainly of irregularly folded nucleosome fibers no thicker than 11 nm , thus indicating the near absence of regular 30-nm chromatin fibers within chromosomes . in this context , has the study of the structural organization of chromatin in situ using the feulgen - like osmium - ammine technique added to our knowledge ? the major questions explored were the following : i ) are the 11-nm and the 30-nm chromatin fibers present in situ ? ii ) which of these two kinds of fibers represents the basic unit of chromatin in situ ? the studies conducted in situ were mainly carried out using mammalian cells characterized by a physiological dispersion of chromatin , such as regenerating hepatocytes , which greatly facilitated the observations of chromatin structural organization . furthermore , these cells have very large nucleolar bodies characterized by a greater electron - translucency than the nucleoplasmic space , a consequence of rrna extraction due to the hcl hydrolysis . in the nucleolar bodies most of the intranucleolar chromatin structures consist of very small clumps and of thin fibers which are well separated from each other and can be followed for a very long tract , unlike the fibers in the extra - nucleolar compartment ( figure 5a ) . these characteristics rendered the regenerating rat hepatocyte nuclei , and especially the intranucleolar chromatin , particularly suitable for the high resolution study of the chromatin structure in situ . the studies conducted on this type of cells revealed the presence of both 11 and 20 - 25 nm chromatin fibers . regarding the 11-nm fibers , they were easily recognized within the nucleolar body and frequently appear to be loosely interwoven to each other ( figure 5b ) . visualization of the 11-nm fibers was improved by the use of stereo - pair micrographs , which demonstrated that many of the chromatin structures were composed of these kind of fibers ( figure 6a ) . the analysis of stereopair micrographs allowed these fibers to be detected giving rise to rings of different diameter , frequently intermingled together ( figure 6b ) . regarding the thicker chromatin fibers , the analysis of chromatin structure in situ did not reveal the presence of fibers with an actual thickness of 30 nm , but , in fact showed fibers with a thickness ranging from 20 to 25 nm . this kind of fibers were mainly observed within the nucleolar body ( supplementary figure 3 ) , always as solitary fibers , and never being clearly observed to constitute more complex chromatin structures , in contrast to the 11 nm thick fibers . the 20 - 25 nm thick fibers did not show either a solenoid or a beaded organization . other than the 11 and the 20 - 25 nm fibers , fibers with intermediate thickness were also observed . analysis of these fibers using high magnification stereopair micrographs indicated that these fibers appeared to be frequently composed of two 11 nm thick nucleofilaments wound around one - another ( figure 7a ) , thus suggesting that the 20 - 25 nm thick fibers might result from the association of two 11 nm fibers . regarding the structure of the chromatin in metaphase chromosomes , in situ analysis after the feulgen - like osmium ammine reaction , also carried out using stereo - pair micrographs , did not allow detection of a clear structural organization in basic units , constituted by either 11 or 25 - 30 nm thick chromatin fibers ( figure 7b ) . altogether these observations are consistent with the available data obtained from different methodological approaches indicating that , in situ , interphase chromatin is mainly organized in fibers with a thickness of about 11 nm ; while the image data are not consistent with a structural organization of chromatin based upon units composed of 30 nm thick chromatin fibers . the first studies conducted using osmium - ammine staining in the feulgen - like reaction allowed easy distinguishing of condensed heterochromatin from dispersed euchromatin of mammalian cell nuclei in situ and clearly established the gross ultrastructural morphology of transcriptionally -

requisite for transcription and whether it must resume the nucleosome configuration for gene silencing . in this context , special attention has been paid to the structural - functional relationship of ribosomal genes . this is due to the fact that , in higher eukaryotes , the rrna genes are present in multiple copies and , therefore , easily studied by different methodological approaches . data obtained from spread chromatin preparations indicated that the transcribing ribosomal genes are constituted by a central dna axis connected with nascent growing rna transcripts whose length progressively increases from the transcription initiation site to the termination site , the well - known christmas tree structure . a series of in vitro studies showed that the dna of the transcribing ribosomal genes is in a nonnucleosomal configuration , whereas that of the repressed transcriptionallyinactive ribosomal genes exhibits a nucleosome organization , suggesting that the activity of ribosomal genes could be regulated by dna unravelling versus compaction into nucleosome . by contrast , in vivo psoralen cross - linking assays have demonstrated that the ratio between the non - nucleosomal and the nucleosomal structured chromatin did not change , even with a marked variation of transcriptional activity , questioning the assumption that ribosome gene transcription can be controlled by dna unravelling and compaction . the study of chromatin in situ using the feulgen - like osmium - ammine staining has greatly contributed to elucidation of the structural - functional organization of ribosomal chromatin . in mammalian cells , during interphase the ribosomal genes associated with transcription factors are located in the nucleolus , within the so - called fibrillar centers ( figure 8a ) . this precise localization has been established by the fact that some factors associated with ribosomal genes ( i.e. , nucleolin , upstream binding factor , and the largest rna polymerase i subunit ) are selectively stained by silver , which is located in the fibrillar centers ( figure 8b ) . it has been repeatedly demonstrated , using the feulgen - like staining , that the ribosomal chromatin is present within the fibrillar centres ( figure 8c ) and it is organized into very thin filaments with a thickness of 2 - 3 nm ( the same thickness as that of the dna filament ) and are loosely interwoven ( figure 8d ) . of note , the greater portion of the ribosomal chromatin within the fibrillar centres is transcriptionally inactive , despite being associated with a number of transcription factors , rrna transcription taking place only at the periphery of the fibrillar centers . in addition , the dna present in metaphase nucleolar organizer regions , which consist of transcriptionally - inactive ribosomal genes are also in an extended non - nucleosomal configuration . this was demonstrated by combining the silver staining procedure for the agnor proteins with the feulgen - like osmium - ammine reaction ( figure 8e , f ) . therefore , these in situ studies support the conclusion that , at least for ribosome genes , the extended , non - nucleosomal structure is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for transcription and that gene inactivation during interphase and metaphase does not always occur by dna compaction into nucleosomes . unfortunately there are no available data on the structure - function relation of other genes in situ that might lead to similar or divergent conclusions . indeed , extended dna filaments similar to those observed in the nucleolus have never been clearly found in the nucleoplasmic space , even in high transcriptionally - active nuclei such as those of regenerating hepatocytes . however , the possibility can not be ruled out that the lack of visualization of extended dna filaments in the extra - nucleolar compartment may be due to the low number of copies of the transcriptionally active non - ribosomal genes . the ultrastructural studies conducted in situ at the electron microscope level using the feulgen - like osmium - ammine reaction for the selective staining of dna have helped to define the structural - functional organization of interphase and metaphase chromatin in mammalian cells . the major contributions are the following : i ) the gross chromatin morphology appears to depend upon rna polymerase ii transcriptional activity ; a clear compartmentalization into chromatin territories , peri - chromatin region and inter - chromatin space is present only within nuclei with a low transcriptional activity ; compartmentalization is lost during enhanced rna synthesis . this demonstrated high plasticity of chromatin is consistent both with the chromosome territory - interchromatin model and with the interchromatin network model : the nuclear architecture model depending upon the transcriptional activity of the cell . ii ) the structural organization of interphase chromatin appears to be mainly based on the about 11 nm thick fiber . thicker chromatin fibers ( 20 - 25 nm thick ) were also visualized , but only in special nuclear districts ( i.e. , the nucleolar body ) , where these fibers sometimes appeared to be composed of two interwoven 11 nm thick fibers . no evidence was obtained that the 20 - 25 nm thick chromatin fiber represents a basic unit of condensed interphase chromatin or of metaphase chromosomes . therefore , these data are consistent with a model of structural organization of chromatin based on the 11 thick fibers , but not upon on higher - order ( 20 - 30 nm thick ) fibers . iii ) not all transcriptionallyinactive chromatin is organized into nucleosomes , as observed for a portion of chromatin containing the ribosomal genes . this conclusion is consistent with the data obtained from the psoralen photocrosslinking assay of ribosomal chromatin structure , suggesting a model for control of ribosome gene activity that is not mediated simply by dna unraveling from , or compaction into the nucleosome structure .","ultrastructural studies conducted in situ using conventional transmission electron microscopy have had relatively little impact on defining the structural organization of chromatin . 
 this is due to the fact that in routine transmission electron microscopy , together with the deoxyribonucleoprotein , many different intermingled substances are contrasted , masking the ultrastructure of chromatin . by selective staining of dna in thin sections , using the feulgen - like osmium - ammine reaction , these drawbacks have been overcome and worthwhile data have been obtained both on the gross morphology and the ultrastructural - functional organization of chromatin in situ . in the present study these results are reviewed and discussed in light of recent achievements in both interphase nuclear chromatin compartmentalization in interphase nuclei and in the structural organization of chromatin fibers in transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin .",169
"nevertheless , completely laparoscopic colorectal procedures have been adopted in clinical practice by a limited number of surgeons . this is possibly due to increased operating time and costs , to the fact that their relative benefit is as yet unclear , and that these procedures are technically demanding . the latter reason prompted this experimental study , which was carried out to evaluate whether a previously described intracorporeal approach to sigmoid resection could be facilitated and applied to the rectum in a porcine model . ten domestic pigs with a median weight of 40.7 kg ( range 38.5 - 43 kg ) were anesthetized with intubation and ventilation with halothane . prior to surgery , the animals were fasted for 48 hours and kept on fluids ad libitum and received a 2-liter enema . pneumoperitoneum was induced using carbon dioxide insufflated to a pressure of 10 mm hg by placement of a trocar in the infraumbilical skin using a cut - down technique . two 12 mm ports were then inserted in the left hypocondrium and in the midline cephalad to the umbilicus . due to porcine anatomy , a 33 mm cannula ( endopath , ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) was inserted in the right iliac fossa rather than suprapubically . all subjects were turned into a steep head - down position in addition to a right lateral tilt until no small bowel was seen in the field . a surgical technique previously described for laparoscopic sigmoid resection with intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis and specimen removal via a suprapubic incision once the proximal site of bowel division was identified , a laparoscopic pursestring clamp ( ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) ( figure 1 ) was applied to the colon , and two straight needles ( placed at opposite ends of a monofilament suture and held in position against the clamp by an endoloop ) were passed through the clamp and retrieved through a port , as previously described . the colon was divided with scissors against the pursestring clamp after having been ligated with an intracorporeally knotted suture . the lower third of the rectum was transected with an articulating endoscopic stapler ( ets flex 35 , ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) . a plastic bag allowed temporary intra - abdominal storage of the specimen . the rectal stump was irrigated by 1uminal wash - out in order to verify that the linear staple row was tight . the anvil of a circular stapler ( ecs 25 ethicon endosurgery , cincinnati , oh ) held by a modified allis - clamp was inserted through the 33 mm port into the colon and the pursestring was tied intracorporeally around the anvil notch . the same circular gun with a spike fixed to its shaft was introduced per anum ( figure 2 ) , and a doublestapled colorectal anastomosis was performed according to a previously - described technique . the integrity of the anastomosis was checked by irrigation with methylene blue after the application of a noncrushing intestinal clamp just proximal to the circular staple line . the specimen , in a plastic bag , was delivered through the 33 mm port . circular stapler with spike fixed to its shaft is advanced behind the staple line of the rectal stump . complete proximal and distal doughnuts were obtained in all cases and anastomoses were all methylene blue tight . the mean anastomotic level from the anal verge was 5.2 cm ( range 4 - 6 cm ) . all porcine subjects had an uneventful 5-week postoperative course at the end of which both laparoscopy and rigid proctoscopy were carried out . at celioscopy there were no adhesions or other abnormalities at the anastomotic site , while endoscopy revealed normal suture lines . histology of colorectal anastomoses revealed healing mucosa with neither foreign body reactions nor thickening of bowel wall at anastomotic site . transection of the rectum at a lower level can be achieved inserting an open - surgery articulating stapler through a suprapubic incision . however , this approach requires a third stapler ( in addition to endoscopic linear and circular staplers ) , re - establishing pneumoperitoneum twice , and manipulation of an open - surgery stapling device with laparoscopic graspers . the results of the present experimental study show that the use of a laparoscopic articulating stapling device helps to overcome these downsides and allows secure division of the low rectum . intracorporeally hand - sewn pursestring sutures are usually fashioned with curved or ski - shaped needles on the proximal colon , but this is a time - consuming procedure . the introduction of the t - needle technique ( endo - stitch , ussc , norwalk , ct ) failed to facilitate this procedure . in fact , since the t - needle should not be detached from the instrument 's jaws ( unless for reloading ) , the anvil shaft must , at a certain point , be loosened from the allis - clamp to allow 360 suturing and tying around the pursestring notch of the anvil . , that the use of a laparoscopic pursestring suture clamp seems to facilitate the construction of intracorporeal pursestring sutures and results in a safe colorectal anastomosis . according to previously described techniques , once the circular stapling gun 's central spike ( auto suture , pceeatm , ussc , norwalk , connecticut ) is advanced behind the staple line of the rectal stump , the spike must be disconnected and removed through a port ( figure 3 ) . the use of a gun adapted for laparoscopy ( with a spike fixed to its shaft ) ( figure 2 ) eliminates the need for retrieval of the spike . the present study shows that a previously described intracorporeal approach to sigmoid resection can be facilitated and applied safely to the rectum in a porcine model . however , further experimental and clinical comparative studies are needed with regard to safety , time - frame and costs of the construction of intracorporeal pursestring sutures .","background and objectives : an experimental study was undertaken to evaluate whether a previously described technique for laparoscopic sigmoid resection with intracorporeal resection - anastomosis and specimen removal via a suprapubic incision could be facilitated and applied to the rectum.methods:ten domestic pigs ( median weight 41 kg ) underwent low anterior resection of the rectum , which was transected with an articulating endoscopic stapler .

 concentrations and body weights and bcs . this is the first report of the adiponectin and resistin concentrations in the milk of saanen goats . leptin gene expression in the mammary gland of alpine goats 
 was reported by bonnet et al . . leptin concentrations were also previously reported in the milk of 
 mixed - parity boer and boer crossbred meat - type goats by whitley et al . . in this study , we measured 
 the leptin levels in lactating saanen goats and confirmed the presence of leptin in goat milk . our data indicate that goat milk and plasma adiponectin and leptin 
 concentrations increased , whereas no changes were observed in the resistin levels during a lactation period of 2080 days . the observed increase in the milk 
 adiponectin concentration during days 2080 of the lactation period has also been reported in humans by ilcol et al . , weyermann et al . , bronsky et al .   and martin et al . in good accordance with previous reports on humans , the adiponectin concentration in goat milk correlated positively with plasma adiponectin levels . the significant 
 association between milk and plasma adiponectin concentrations indicates that circulating adiponectin is likely to be the major source of milk adiponectin . the 
 mammary gland is not a meaningful source of adiponectin , its expression being 0.05% that of adipose tissue . the 
 concentrations of leptin in goat milk and plasma were lower on day 20 than on days 35 , 50 , 65 and 80 days . these results are similar to those reported in 
 mixed - parity boer and boer crossbred meat - type goats . the presence of a significant association between milk and 
 plasma leptin concentrations during days 20 to 80 of lactation indicates that circulating leptin may be the major source of milk leptin . the observed relationship 
 between milk and plasma leptin concentrations during days 20 to 80 of lactation has also been reported in humans by ucar et al .   and ilcol et al . . as the number of lactation days increased 
 from 20 to 80 , non - significant differences were observed in the milk and plasma resistin concentrations of saanen goats . .   demonstrated that milk resistin concentrations were highest in colostrum , decreased rapidly during 
 postpartum days 414 and remained low during postpartum days 15180 . the positive correlation between these three adipokine concentrations in goat milk in the 
 current study during days 20 to 80 of lactation is also in good accordance with a previous observation in cord blood , milk and blood [ 14 , 18 , 40 ] . however , an inverse relationship between the 
 resistin concentrations and both the leptin and adiponectin concentrations in milk and plasma was observed in some previous studies on humans [ 28 , 29 ] . these differences between the results of the current study and those of ilcol 
 et al . [ 28 , 29 ] may be due to changes in regulatory mechanisms 
 and factors for circulating adiponectin , leptin and resistin concentrations in goats and humans . our results show that the circulatory concentrations of these 
 three adipokines are interrelated in days 20 to 80 of the lactation period of saanen goats . it appears that the changes in the milk and plasma adiponectin 
 concentrations coincide with changes in the plasma leptin and resistin concentrations . adiponectin , leptin and resistin hormones are secreted biologically active forms into milk and may transiently regulate the activities of 
 various tissues until the endocrine system of the neonate begins to function . these bioactive milk peptides also play important roles , such as energy intake and 
 systemic and local imflammatory status . [ 5 , 15 , 33 ] . at this point , another important focus of this study was a positive correlation between crp and these three adipokines . crp , a marker of systemic 
 inflammation , was known as a stimulator of monocytes and macrophages [ 31 , 34 ] . there 
 were a positive correlation between the crp and leptin and resistin concentrations in goat milk and an inverse correlation between crp and milk adiponectin , 
 consistent with previous studies in humans [ 14 , 28 , 39 ] . it not only regulates t - cell proliferation and activation 
 but also influences cytokine production from t lymphocytes [ 9 , 16 ] . furthermore , ble 
 et al .   demonstrated a direct crp - stimulatory activation of leptin , independent of il-6 or other 
 proinflammatory cytokines in humans . the inverse relationship between crp and milk adiponectin in this study is in strong accordance with previous studies on 
 humans that report that proinflammatory factors suppress the adiponectin production of adipocytes [ 21 , 25 , 26 , 34 , 42 ] . resistin , mononuclear cells and macrophages , other major sources of circulating resistin , have also been implicated in the inflammatory response of 
 humans . in good accordance with recent studies on human milk [ 11 , 14 , 23 ] , we observed that plasma crp 
 correlated positively with milk resistin . scc is recognized as a reliable indicator of animals udder health ( local inflammation ) and milk quality and changes in 
 their milk composition . the milk somatic cells include leucocytes , neutrophils , macrophages , lymphocytes , erythrocytes and epithelial cells . moreover , a high scc 
 is directly related to inverse effects on human health , including poor farm hygiene , antibiotic residues and the presence of pathogenic bacteria and toxins in 
 milk [ 27 , 35 ] . the inverse relationship between adiponectin and scc or crp may be 
 related to the fact that adiponectin gene expression is decreased by oxidative stress or a pro - inflammatory state . in this study , no relation was observed between 
 these three adipokines and the total aerobic colony count , which represents the total amount of viable microorganisms that could grow aerobically on plate - count 
 agar , and the lactobacillus count . lactobacilli , non - pathogen microorganisms , may possess potentially therapeutic properties , including anti - inflammatory and 
 anti - cancer activities . protective anti - tumor and anti - cancer effects of some strains of these bacteria were demonstrated in mice . a recent study reported that there may be a relationship between lactobacilli and the health of bovine udders . in the current study , we did not find a relationship between lactobacilli and these milk adipokines . we also determined whether the milk levels of leptin , adiponectin and resistin are related to the milk composition of lactating goats . however , no correlation 
 was observed between the milk concentrations of these major adipokines and milk composition . in conclusion , the current study is the first to show adiponectin and resistin concentrations in the milk of saanen goats during days 20 to 80 of the lactation 
 period . the data from the current study show interrelationships between the milk concentrations of adiponectin , leptin and resistin and significant positive 
 relationships between the milk and plasma concentrations of these three major adipokines during days 20 to 80 of the lactation period in goats . the concentrations 
 of leptin and resistin in goat milk are also positively related to the plasma crp concentrations , whereas the milk adiponectin concentration is inversely related 
 to the plasma crp concentration and milk ssc . the findings in this study indicate a possible role of these three adipokines in the inflammatory status of goat 
 milk , but more in - depth analyses are necessary to determine the mechanism and to better define their function .","the main objectives of our study were to measure the major adipokines adiponectin , leptin and resistin in goat milk , to assess their interrelationships and to 
 assess their relationships with the plasma and serum concentrations of total protein , cholesterol , total lipids , plasma c - reactive protein ( crp ) , milk somatic 
 cell count ( scc ) , milk total aerobic colony and lactobacillus count , and milk components in lactating saanen goats . 
 the study was performed on eighteen 
 lactating saanen goats . 
 milk and blood samples were collected on days 20 , 35 , 50 , 65 and 80 of lactation postpartum . 
 the milk and plasma adiponectin levels on 
 days 50 , 65 and 80 postpartum were significantly higher than those on day 20 . 
 the milk and plasma leptin levels were lower on day 20 than on days 35 , 50 , 65 and 
 80 . 
 the milk concentrations of these major adipokines were positively intercorrelated . 
 the milk and plasma concentrations of these three adipokines were also 
 positively correlated . 
 the plasma crp concentrations correlated positively with milk leptin and resistin concentrations and inversely with milk adiponectin 
 concentration . 
 milk adiponectin concentration was inversely related with its scc . 
 these data confirm that adiponectin , leptin and resistin are present in goat 
 milk . 
 the milk concentrations of these three adipokines were interrelated and interacted with the general inflammatory marker , crp . 
 the inverse relationship 
 between milk adiponectin concentrations and its scc suggests that variations in milk adiponectin might be involved in the udder health of lactating goats , but 
 clinical trials are needed to support this hypothesis .",367
"dsrcts are rare tumours of young adults ( mean age 28.3  years ) with a male predominance ( 4:1 ) .  painful abdominal masses clinically predominate . multifocal peritoneal masses with a dominant soft tissue lesion is a distinctive imaging finding . a large desmoplastic reaction differentiates dsrcts from histologically similar round cell subtypes .  despite debulking surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy , median survival from diagnosis is 22.3  months . desmoplastic small round cell tumour ( dsrct ) is a rare but highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that arises most commonly in the abdomino - pelvic cavity of males in adolescence or young adulthood . , this tumour is so called due to its typical histological finding of nests of small blue round cells within a dense desmoplastic stroma . differentiation of dsrct from other soft tissue sarcomas is important , as it is a high - grade neoplasm often presenting with advanced disease , with a mean survival time of less than 3  years [ 3 , 4 ] . there are limited data describing the imaging features of dsrct with several published case reports but no substantial case series . this is the largest imaging review of dsrct to date in the context of the demographic and clinical data , describing the imaging features on computed tomography ( ct ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , ultrasound and positron emission tomography ( pet ) that are most suggestive of dsrct . the role of imaging , current treatment options and the follow - up of these patients is also discussed . the imaging of 28 patients with biopsy - proven dsrct was referred to the royal marsden hospital soft tissue tumour unit for diagnosis and management over a 21-year period ( from 1st january 1991 to 21st may 2012 ) . eight patients were referred for opinion only and were managed subsequently at their local hospital . the referral imaging was not pacs - archived for recall analysis at our institution and these patients were excluded from the study ( n  =  20 ) . the initial imaging of the majority of patients was performed at local hospitals where imaging protocols adopted in those studies could not be influenced . imaging was only repeated if clinically indicated . in all patients , the diagnosis of dsrct was confirmed at our institution , following percutaneous or surgical biopsy using a combination of histological , immunohistochemical and molecular cytogenetic profiles . the majority of these biopsies were performed in this hospital and the few performed at the referring institution had the biopsy samples re - reviewed by a specialist soft tissue tumour pathologist . clinical and demographic data ( including clinical management and patient outcome ) was obtained from the database and review of individual patient case notes was undertaken where appropriate . two radiologists experienced in sarcoma imaging reviewed all imaging studies and consensus opinion was reached . in each study , the following imaging findings were recorded : the presence of peritoneal deposits ; a dominant soft tissue lesion ( location , size , the presence of cystic , heterogeneous or calcific components and the presence of enhancement ) ; peritoneal or peritoneal fluid ; site and location of enlarged lymph nodes ; visceral obstruction ; distant metastatic disease . enhancement of the lesion was characterised by comparing the density of the lesion with that of the normally enhancing liver . the mean age at presentation was 28.3  years ( age range 1546  years ) . the most common clinical presentation was of an abdominal mass ( 15 patients [ 75  % ] ) . the next most common presentations were with abdominal pain ( ten patients [ 50  % ] ) and weight loss ( three patients [ 15  % ] ) , with sweats ( one patient [ 5  % ] ) , back pain ( one patient [ 5  % ] ) and lethargy ( one patient [ 5  % ] ) also noted . in two patients ( 10  % ) , the presentation was an incidental finding at surgery , in one patient during appendicectomy for appendicitis and in the other during caesarean section delivery . all patients underwent contrast enhanced ct ( cect ) at presentation , prior to treatment . of these , six underwent ct of the abdomen and pelvis and 14 underwent ct of the chest , abdomen and pelvis . cect of the chest was obtained in the arterial phase , and cect of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained in the portal venous phase . of the six patients who did not have ct imaging of the chest , chest radiographs were performed . the most common ct finding at presentation was peritoneal / omental disease ( 19/20 patients [ 95  % ] ) . in 17 of these 19 patients ( 89  % ) , this manifested as multiple peritoneal / omental soft tissue masses , with a solitary peritoneal mass seen in the remaining 2/19 ( 10  % ) cases ( fig .  1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) . in the one case without peritoneal disease , there was a right paravertebral mass posterior to the diaphragmatic crus with metastatic involvement of the adjacent t11 and t12 vertebral bodies ( fig . 1

free survival from starting first line chemotherapy was 15.6  months ( 95  % ci 8.223.1 ) . the median overall survival from diagnosis was 22.8  months ( 95  % ci 1035.5 ) . dsrct is an extremely rare and aggressive soft tissue sarcoma , with only a few hundred cases reported in the literature . this tumour generally presents with multifocal abdomino - pelvic masses and is reported to occur in adolescence and early adulthood . in our series of patients , the mean age at presentation was 28.3  years , with the oldest patient being 46  years of age . this is slightly higher than the usual age range of 1825  years , although dsrct has been reported in patients older than this . the male - to - female ratio of dsrct is reported to be 4:1 [ 6 , 7 ] . in our patient cohort , the male - to - female ratio was 5:1 , confirming a male preponderance in this histological subtype . the aetiology of dsrct is unknown but it is thought to be a malignancy of the mesothelium and , as such , occurs most commonly in the peritoneum and omentum . it has also been noted to occur in other sites of mesothelial origin such as the pleura and tunica vaginalis of the testis as well as solid organs including the pancreas , liver , kidneys and ovaries [ 5 , 912 ] . in our series , 19 cases ( 95  % ) involved the peritoneum or omentum , with only one case occurring in an extraperitoneal location ( fig . the imaging findings in our series represent the largest review in the literature to our knowledge . characteristic imaging features included diffuse peritoneal / omental masses ( 95  % ) with multiple soft tissue deposits seen in 79  % of these cases ( fig . a dominant soft tissue mass not involving a visceral organ of origin , either solitary or at least twice the size of other peritoneal / omental lesions was seen in 80  % of patients ( figs .  1a , 2 ) . this has been noted in previous smaller studies [ 1316 ] . in a review of the ct findings of 11 patients with dsrct by bellah et al . , in their cohort 82  % of the dominant lesions were in the rectovesical or rectouterine space and they postulated that this might be due to the dynamic flow of peritoneal fluid and the dependency of these locations . however , our findings do not support this theory , with only 36  % ( 5/16 patients ) of the dominant lesions occurring in the pelvis , the remainder occurring in the abdomen ( 62  % ) and the right paravertebral region arising from the diaphragmatic crus ( 6  % ) . regarding the imaging characteristics of the soft tissue lesions , enhancement following intravenous contrast this was heterogeneous in 70  % of cases on ct and in 100  % of the four cases in which lesions were characterised further using contrast enhanced mri . central cystic morphology was seen within lesions on ct in 50  % of cases and in 100  % of the four cases evaluated on mri , most likely to be due to necrosis , haemorrhage or a fibromyxoid component to the tumour ( figs .  1a , 2 ) [ 14 , 16 ] . the presence of calcification within lesions has been reported variably in the literature , with one study of 13 patients documenting the absence of lesional calcification in all patients . however , other smaller studies have shown a prevalence of lesional calcification of between 2255  % [ 14 , 15 , 19 ] . in our cohort , lesional calcification was noted in 20  % of cases on ct ( fig .  2 ) . this suggests that whilst lesional calcification is a not uncommon finding in dsrct , it is not frequent enough a finding to be characteristic . whilst haemorrhagic tumour necrosis has been noted on mri in the literature , none of the cases evaluated with mri in our cohort demonstrated lesional t1 hyperintensity or t2 fluid - fluid levels to suggest the presence of haemorrhage [ 19 , 20 , 22 ] . lymph node enlargement was a common finding , demonstrated in 50  % of patients at presentation . of those patients with lymph node involvement , 80  % had retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement , with the next most common sites being in the mediastinal ( 20  % ) and mesenteric ( 13  % ) regions . this is consistent with prior smaller studies noting lymphatic spread at presentation [ 1419 ] . ascites ( 30  % ) and pleural effusions ( 25  % ) at presentation were common findings in our study , and this is again consistent with smaller studies . .   demonstrated distant metastases in 50  % of their cases and whilst the frequency in our larger patient cohort was lower ( 30  % ) , our findings still suggest that metastases are common at presentation . as such , imaging studies should be evaluated thoroughly for metastases , particularly in the liver and bones ( fig . smaller cohort studies of four to eight patients suggest pleural involvement in 63100  % [ 20 , 21 ] . this contradicts our findings of only one patient ( 0.5  % ) having macroscopic disease above the diaphragm . in our experience , ct plays the most useful role in diagnosis and staging of dsrct and should be the initial imaging test of choice . ultrasound may be helpful in guiding percutaneous biopsy of relatively superficial lesions but it does not help characterise lesions further , typically demonstrating lobulated , heterogeneous hypo - echoic lesions ( fig . whilst mri can provide some further characterisation of the lesions of dsrct ( such as the presence of intra lesional haemorrhagic necrosis ) , these characteristics do not occur frequently enough with this tumour to make the findings helpful in differentiating dsrct from other tumours . fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg)-pet / ct has been shown to identify occult lesions not demonstrated on ct or mri [ 15 , 19 ] . histologically because the small round cells are seen embedded in a prominent desmoplastic stroma ( fig . this in particular may be useful in the assessment of tumour response to chemo- or radiotherapy , and could detect early tumoral relapse before conventional anatomical imaging [ 2426].fig . 8two trans abdominal ultrasound images acquired in the transverse and longitudinal plane in a 29-year -

dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue has been explored but no overall survival benefit has been demonstrated . hyperthermic intra - peritoneal chemotherapy ( hipec ) , developed in the therapy of metastatic ovarian carcinoma , has been investigated . a retrospective review compared patients receiving chemotherapy alone , debulking surgery alone and debulking surgery followed by hipec . there was no statistical difference between the two surgical groups , reporting 62  % and 71  % 3-year survival respectively . the cohort receiving surgery did significantly better than those in the chemotherapy alone group ( 26  % 3-year survival ) . the role of novel molecularly targeted agents has provoked interest as the translocation associated with dscrt could potentially give rise to therapeutic targets such as insulin - like growth factor 1 and platelet - derived growth factor . case reports show benefit with novel agents such as imatinib , sunitinib , sorafenib and temsirolimus . whole abdominal radiotherapy ( wap ) has been used as part of multimodality treatment in addition to surgery and chemotherapy . wap is a toxic treatment in both the long and short term , and note is made that in one series the majority of patients relapsed in field . intensity modulated radiation therapy ( imrt ) has been shown to be feasible and associated with less bowel toxicity . dscrt remains a challenging disease to treat and evidence supports the use of maximum debulking therapy , where possible in combination with multiagent chemotherapy . there remains a need for prospective clinical trials , although this is challenge in such a rare tumour type . our case series of 20 patients , support smaller cohort studies in the characteristic imaging features and the diagnosis should be suspected in adolescent / young males in whom imaging studies demonstrate : diffuse peritoneal involvement with multiple soft tissue lesionsdominant soft tissue lesion measuring at least 5  cm without a visceral organ of origin diffuse peritoneal involvement with multiple soft tissue lesions dominant soft tissue lesion measuring at least 5  cm without a visceral organ of origin supporting ancillary findings include : heterogeneous tumoral enhancementcystic change and calcificationmetastatic spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes , liver and spine these imaging features were not found frequently enough to be characteristic of dsrct , and although their incidence varies throughout the literature , they are in line with smaller cohort groups . several studies found a strong propensity towards pleural disease , but despite our common findings of a pleural effusion , our data did not support macroscopic pleural involvement . heterogeneous tumoral enhancement cystic change and calcification metastatic spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes , liver and spine these imaging features were not found frequently enough to be characteristic of dsrct , and although their incidence varies throughout the literature , they are in line with smaller cohort groups . several studies found a strong propensity towards pleural disease , but despite our common findings of a pleural effusion , our data did not support macroscopic pleural involvement . there is unanimous support for ct as the primary imaging modality of choice in dsrct , with ultrasound and mri offering additional information in individual cases . fdg -

 this review discusses distinctive radiological features , histopathology and clinical course of this soft - tissue sarcoma.methodsfrom 1991 to 2012 , the radiology of 20 patients with pathologically proven dsrct was independently reviewed by two experienced radiologists . 
 the clinical presentation , treatment and outcome were recorded.resultspatients : 16 men , four women ; mean age 28.3  years . computed tomography ( ct ) demonstrated peritoneal / omental masses without an organ of origin ( 94  % ) , with the majority of cases demonstrating large ( > 5  cm ) dominant soft - tissue deposit ( 80  % ) with multiple smaller foci . 
 ct and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) typically demonstrated heterogeneous soft - tissue enhancement with cystic degeneration . 
 a minority ( 20  % ) demonstrated calcification . 
 lymph node enlargement occurred in 50  % of cases . 
 distant metastatic disease occurred in 25  % . 
 painful abdominal masses were clinically predominant . 
 treatment strategies include combination chemotherapy with debulking surgery and/or radiotherapy . 
 median survival from diagnosis was 22.8  months.conclusionfeatures of multifocal peritoneal / omental masses , usually in combination with a dominant soft tissue deposit , are distinctive in this rare sarcoma . 
 ct / mri defines the extent of disease and characterises supporting imaging findings . 
 prolific desmoplastic reaction histologically separates dsrct from similar subtypes . 
 combination treatment strategies can infer a survival benefit but prognosis remains poor.teaching points dsrcts are rare tumours of young adults ( mean age 28.3  years ) with a male predominance ( 4:1). painful abdominal masses clinically predominate . 
 non - specific features of malignancy can be present. multifocal peritoneal masses with a dominant soft tissue lesion is a distinctive imaging finding. a large desmoplastic reaction differentiates dsrcts from histologically similar round cell subtypes. despite debulking surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy , median survival from diagnosis is 22.3  months .",462
"wandering spleen , also known as ectopic spleen , is an uncommon clinical entity characterized by hypermobility of the spleen due to laxity or absence of the normal ligaments that attach the spleen to the left upper quadrant . this allows the spleen to essentially drop to the lower abdomen by the force of gravity attached only to its abnormally elongated vascular pedicle . common complications of a wandering spleen include torsion of its pedicle , compression of another organ by the spleen or the pedicle , and susceptibility of the spleen to trauma . symptoms are most commonly attributed to complications related to irreducible torsion which produces venous congestion , arterial infraction , strangulation and rupture of the spleen . treatment of choice is splenopexy for an uncomplicated or complicated but viable wandering spleen and splenectomy for a non - viable spleen . herein , we present a case of a patient with progressive torsion of a pelvic spleen causing recurrent abdominal pain and eventually spleen strangulation and rupture . a 46-year - old male was admitted to the emergency department complaining of constant left lower quadrant abdominal pain of increasing severity for the last 6 days . direct questioning revealed a history of mild , intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past 65 days . the patient was febrile ( 38.8  c ) , had tachycardia ( 118  beats / min ) and blood pressure of 90/50  mmhg . physical examination revealed abdominal distention , predominantly in the hypogastric region due to a tender mass causing dullness on percussion suprapubicly . pelvic mass or pelvic peritonitis arised from a variety of causes were included in the differential diagnosis . abdominal x - rays revealed increased pelvic radio - opaqueness , few dilated loops of small intestine , and displacement of the splenic flexure in the normal spleen position . emergency ct revealed absence of the spleen in its normal position , a homogeneous pelvic mass with no contrast enhancement pushing aside the sigmoid colon , free blood in the peritoneal cavity around the mass , and a normal urinary tract . the absence of the spleen in its normal position and the non - enhancement of the pelvic mass made the diagnosis of an ectopic strangulated spleen undeniable . the spleen was enlarged ( 23  cm    18  cm    12  cm ) , located inside the pelvis , attached to an abnormally elongated torted pedicle ( 19  cm ) , and adhered to the greater omentum and intestine ( none of splenic ligaments were present ) ( fig . the spleen was strangulated due to the 760 clockwise twists of its pedicle ( fig . 2 ) , and ruptured at its lower pole ( 2  cm in depth , not evolving a trabecular vessel grade ii laceration ) . 3 ) ; however , the organ continued to appear non - viable and total splenectomy was performed . thorough investigation revealed no evidence of accessory spleens in the left upper quadrant , the bowel mesentery , the greater omentum and the pelvis . during exploration histology revealed acute thrombotic changes in arteries and veins of the splenic hilum , with diffuse hemorrhagic and ischemic infarcts of the spleen . the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day without any complication . wandering spleen is a rarely diagnosed clinical entity . according to our knowledge less than 500 cases of patients with recurrent abdominal pain or abdominal emergency caused by a wandering spleen moreover , splenectomy for treatment of a wandering spleen account for less than 0.25% of splenectomies in reported series . wandering spleen is 7 times more common in females than males after age 10 and 2.5 times more common in males than females under the age of 1 year . the most common age of presentation is childhood especially under 1 year of age followed by the third decade of life , and is more frequently seen in females of reproductive age . wandering spleen occurs because of either extreme laxity or absence of the normal ligaments that attach the spleen to its fixed position in the left upper quadrant . three of these ligaments are virtually always present ( except in the condition of the wandering spleen ) , and two may be present to variable extents . the three ligaments , that are constantly present , are the splenogastric ligament , the splenorenal ligament and the splenocolic ligament . the two ligaments , that are variably present , are the splenoomental and the splenophrenic ligament . absence or laxity of the above mentioned ligaments allows the spleen to essentially drop to the lower abdomen in either the right or the left lower quadrant by the force of gravity attached by its elongated vascular pedicle . it occurs most probably as a result of congenital anomalies in the development of the dorsal mesogastrium and the absence or malformation of the normal splenic suspensory ligaments . conditions associated with wandering spleen include enlargement or absence of a kidney , splenomegaly and previous pregnancy . splenomegaly and pregnancy are thought to contribute to the laxity of the supporting structure by direct effect of gravity and estrogen respectively . symptoms may remain limited or absent for long periods of time , but complications related to torsion , compression of another organ by the spleen or its pedicle and susceptibility of the spleen to trauma are quite common . initially , irreducible torsion produces venous congestion as a result of which the spleen becomes edematous and enlarged . eventually , progressive torsion results in infraction of the arterial supply , acute ischemia , strangulation , necrosis and rupture of the congested and gangrenous spleen . more frequently , patients are admitted due to a non specific chronic pelvic pain related to splenomegaly or pressure on adjacent organs . the most common physical finding is a palpable lower abdominal mass representing the abnormally enlarged torted spleen . laboratory tests are usually nonspecific , but may occasionally reveal evidence of hypersplenism or functional asplenia . ultrasonography , nuclear scintigraphy , ct and mri can prove useful in revealing the nature of a pelvic mass of unknown entity and confirm the diagnosis of an ectopic spleen . operative management is the treatment of choice in uncomplicated and complicated cases because conservative treatment of an asymptomatic wandering spleen is associated with a complication rate of 65% . the wandering spleen is ideally for laparoscopic splenectomy because it is generally free from attachments and other organs . the treatment for a wandering spleen as an incidental finding at laparotomy or if the torsion can be corrected and the spleen appears to be viable is splenopexy . splenopexy has been successful in preventing complications of wandering spleen while preserving the splenic function . they applied open or laparoscopic techniques with or without using a mesh and peritoneal flaps . as the torsion involves the vascular pedicle , partial splenectomy or splenic implantation of the totally strangulated spleen is usually unattainable . however , partial infraction of a wandering spleen necessitating partial splenectomy and splenopexy or splenectomy and splenic implantation has been reported in the literature . the present report was referred to a patient with progressive torsion of a pelvic spleen causing recurrent abdominal pain and eventually spleen strangulation and rupture . the patient exhibited a period of vague intermittent lower abdominal pain lasted 65 days followed by a period of constant left lower quadrant pain of increasing severity lasted 6 days . on the first 65 days , vague pain was attributed to progressive torsion which resulted in venous congestion and enlargement of the spleen . on the last 6 days , exacerbation of pain was attributed to irreducible torsion , infraction of the arterial supply , acute ischemia , strangulation , necrosis and rupture of the congested and gangrenous spleen . although the presence of the ectopic spleen could be easily identifiable on serial physical examinations since childhood , it was diagnosed in adulthood due to manifestation of complications . written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images . konstantinos boulas , salpigktidis i and barettas n equally contributed to the writing of this paper . konstantinos blouhos , anestis hatzigeorgiadis and konstantinos boulas

"digital radiograph or radiovisiography was first described in 1987 and was commercially introduced by trophy radiologie in collaboration with mouyen12 in 1993 . three systems are employed for radiovisiography : the ccd sensor ( charge - coupled device ) , cmos sensor ( complementary metallic oxide sensor ) , and psps ( psps  phosphor storage plate  optical plate ) ; the latter includes the digora , digident , denoptix and den ortix systems11 . however , some doubts remain in the use of radiovisiography based on the optical plate system as to the durability of the plate3 , image quality according to the processing delay1,2,14 , and storage conditions10 . no study has yet investigated the influence of utilization of opaque cases on the quality of digital image . this ex vivo study evaluated the quality of digital radiographic images obtained with the digora system according to the processing delay and maintenance of optical plates in either opaque ( supplied with the system ) or transparent protective plastic cases during this period . the study was conducted on a dry human mandible fixed on an acrylic resin base . a plastic tube was fixed frontally to the mandible to standardize the position of the x - ray source , thus standardizing the vertical and horizontal angles ( figure 1 ) . a groove was prepared on this resin base to standardize the position of the optical plate . radiographs were obtained from the mandibular molar region by utilization of optical plates with an x - ray unit ( gnatus model xr 6010 ; gnatus , ribeiro preto , sp , brazil ) set at 60 kvp and 10 ma , with open tube , total filtration of 1.5 mm al , exposure time of 0.3 s , and optical plate of the digora system ( soredex , orion corporation , finland ) . two groups were constituted for x - ray exposure : in group a , the optical plate was inserted and sealed in the opaque plastic case supplied by the manufacturer and kept as such until processing ; in group b , the optical plate was stored in a transparent plastic case ( figure 2 ) . the optical plates were processed in the digora scanner immediately and 5 , 60 and 120 min after x - ray exposure , and were transferred to the computer for analysis of digitized images . analysis was performed directly on the computer screen by three examiners using the digora for windows software . the images were analyzed as to brightness , contrast and resolution of tooth structures ( enamel , dentin , root and pulp cavity ) and periapical structures ( periodontal space , cortical bone , alveolar bone ) , which received scores 0 to 2 , as follows : 0- poor image quality ; 1- good image quality ; 2- excellent image quality . data were submitted to the kruskal - wallis non - parametric test , and comparison of results between opaque and transparent cases were submitted by the mann - whitney test . table 1 presents the scores assigned by examiners to the images , according to processing delays and utilization of opaque or transparent plastic cases . there was statistically significant difference ( p<0.05 ) regarding the processing delays , namely immediate , 5 and 60 min with utilization of opaque case ( table 2 ) . this difference was observed between the 120-min delay and the other periods ( table 3 ) . no statistically significant difference ( p>0.05 ) was observed among processing delays with utilization of transparent case ( table 4 ) . comparison of results between opaque and transparent cases did not reveal significant differences ( p>0.05 ) ( table 5 ) . 10.05882 ; chi - square with 3 degrees of freedom ; probability = 0.018072 ( significant ) u=5.00000000;exact probability = 0.150794 ; normal approximation : z=1.96396101 ; probability = 0.04953461 hc= 5.164999 ; chi - square with 3 degrees of freedom ; probability = 0 . digital radiography was introduced to dental practice with a view to replace the conventional radiography due to the shorter exposure to radiation , achievement of high - quality images , possibility of adjustments with aid of software , and comparable reliability to conventional radiography , for both endodontic diagnosis and treatment3,57 , 
  the main disadvantage of the optical plate system is the need of additional time for processing and possible loss of quality when the sensitized optical plate is exposed to light . some authors have emphasized that , after exposure to x - ray , the optical plates should be processed within 1 h in order to avoid loss of image quality1,2 . other authors believe that the plates can be processed within 6 h if stored in appropriate cases10 . in the present study , a processing delay of 120 min caused a mild reduction in image quality , yet without compromising the quality of diagnosis ( table 1 ) . it should be highlighted that the images were not altered as to the brightness and contrast provided by the system , being analyzed as produced on the computer screen . together with the digora system , the manufacturer supplies opaque plastic cases that offer protection against contamination and the deleterious effect of light . images of optical plates maintained in the original opaque cases after exposure to x - ray maintained their image quality up to 120 min ( table 2 ) , with significant difference between the 120- min processing delay and the other periods ( table 3 ) . when the optical plates were maintained in transparent cases , there was also a progressive reduction of image quality ( table 1 ) , which was more accentuated at 120 min ( table 4 ) , though without statistical difference among periods . this is due to the fact that the optical plate protected with transparent cases is subjected to the continuous action of light , with progressive loss of image quality . however , images obtained with optical plates protected with both opaque and transparent cases and with processing delays of up to 120 min provided good quality for diagnosis . the findings of the present study revealed that the processing delay of 120 min for the digora system caused a reduction in image quality , yet without interfering with the quality of diagnosis . the opaque case supplied by the system 's manufacturer provided better protection to the optical plate than the transparent case .","this ex vivo study evaluated the quality of digital radiographic images obtained with the photostimulable phosphor plate system ( digora ) according to the processing delay and maintenance of optical plates in either opaque ( supplied with the system ) or transparent protective plastic cases during this period . 
 five radiographs were obtained from the mandibular molar region of a dry human mandible using optical plates . 
 these plates were placed in the protective plastic cases before obtaining the radiographs and were processed immediately or after processing delays of 5 , 60 and 120 min , when the case was removed . 
 the results revealed a reduction in image quality when processing was delay 120 min compared to the other times . 
 the opaque case provided better protection to the sensor than the transparent case . in conclusion , 
 a 120-min processing delay for the digora system caused a reduction in image quality , yet without interfering with the quality of diagnosis .

"data on the adult ( over 20 years ) population has been reported elsewhere ( 5 ) . the present analysis focused on albertan youth < 20 years of age . flagged in the databases and were defined as any alberta inhabitant registered under the federal indian act and entitled to treaty status with the canadian government . the status aboriginal identifier captures first nations and inuit peoples both on- and off - reserve with treaty status , but not mtis individuals or aboriginal individuals without treaty status who are included in the general population comparison group . alberta law requires that all residents and dependants register with the alberta health care insurance plan , thus the alberta central stakeholder registry functioned as a denominator . diabetes cases were identified by applying the national diabetes surveillance system ( ndss ) algorithm ( 13 ) , which has recently been validated for the determination of pediatric diabetes rates ( 14 ) . the ndss methodology of identifying has been validated in non - aboriginal populations that include persons of varying geographical locations ( 15,16 ) , and also within an aboriginal community in alberta ( 17 ) . the algorithm requires an individual to have either 2 physician visits or 1 hospitalization for diabetes ( icd-9 codes starting with 250 and icd-10 codes e10e14 ) within 2 years to be labelled as case of diabetes ( 13 ) . in contrast to the ndss case definition , pregnant women that may have had gestational diabetes were not excluded in the current analysis due to the elevated risk of subsequent diabetes ( 18 ) . also , since the numbers of diabetes cases are small among this population , only crude , unadjusted rates are provided . for both populations , the denominators were based on the health insurance registry ( which provincial law requires all residents and dependants to register ) for the entire population as of june 30 in each year . the first year in which an individual met the criteria for diabetes ( with no diabetes claims in the preceding 2 years ) was considered an incident year , and considered a prevalent case in subsequent years . prevalence was determined using the following group -

specified fixed interval . tests of parallelism were then performed to determine if trends over time differed by group or sex . based on alberta health and wellness administrative databases , 853,733 youth ( 51.2% male ) were living in the province as of 2007 , of which 50,930 were status aboriginal ( 51.2% male ) . among these youth a total of 2,589 prevalent diabetes cases were apparent in 2007 , with 140 cases occurring amongst status aboriginal youth . the 2007 crude prevalence rate of diabetes was 0.27 and 0.31% in the status aboriginal and general population youth populations respectively ( fig . 1 , table i ) . incidence was 0.59 per 1,000 for status aboriginal and 0.49 per 1,000 for general population . no discernible differences were seen in diabetes prevalence or incidence with respect to group or sex in 2007 ( fig . 1 , crude rates of diabetes among status aboriginal and general population youth in alberta , 19952007 ( adss ) . a = prevalence ; b = incidence . crude diabetes prevalence and incidence among status aboriginal and general population youth , 2007 crude rates of both diabetes prevalence and incidence increased in status aboriginal and general population youth over the observation period ( fig . 1 , table ii ) . however , prevalence grew to a greater extent among status aboriginal youth ( aapc 6.98 ) compared to those in the general population ( aapc 3.93 ; p < 0.01 ) , with status aboriginal males experiencing the largest increase in diabetes prevalence ( aapc 9.18 ) . ethnic differences in diabetes incidence trends were only observed among the male population , which saw a significantly larger rise in incidence for status aboriginal ( aapc 11.65 ) compared to general population males ( aapc 4.62 ; p < 0.01 ) . male youth , regardless of group , experienced greater increases in both prevalence and incidence over time than that of respective female youth ( table ii ) . age - specific crude prevalence and incidence of diabetes by group are shown in fig . 2 . age specific crude rates of diabetes among status aboriginal and general population youth , 1995 and 2007 . ethnicity comparisons of aapc ( average annual percent change ) in diabetes prevalence and incidence among status aboriginal and general population youth , 19952007 p < 0.05 for aapc ethnicity comparison . paralleling adult populations , diabetes among youth is increasing worldwide ( 20 ) . while type 1 diabetes remains the majority of cases in youth , type 2 diabetes ( a disease typically regarded as an adult phenomenon ) is becoming progressively more common in children and adolescents ( 20 ) . we report that youth - onset diabetes is an increasing problem in alberta , especially among status aboriginals . though our results are in line with international data showing increasing trends ( 20,21 ) , they contradict the recent ndss reports ( 12,22 ) , which found diabetes prevalence and incidence rates remained stable at 0.3 and 0.4 ( per 1,000 ) respectfully among general population youth between 20012006 . it is possible that differences in ethnicities and/or socioeconomic parameters contribute to these differences . among indigenous populations especially , including american indian / alaskan natives , australian aborigines , the maori of new zealand , and canadian aboriginals , youth - onset diabetes is increasingly being identified ( 14,2327 ) . in canada , longitudinal trends of diabetes in aboriginal youth had previously only been explored in manitoba . dean and colleagues ( 10 ) showed the crude type 2 diabetes incidence rate rose to 0.55/1,000 ( for ages 019 ) in 2001 . similarly , crude diabetes incidence increased from 0.22 per 1,000 to 0.59 per 1,000 over a 12 year time span in the current analysis . the observed accelerated increase in diabetes among status aboriginal youth is consistent with reports of a decrease in the age of diagnosis of diabetes among aboriginal adults . in saskatchewan type 2 diabetes incidence was highest among status aboriginal adults aged 4049 , while most new diabetes cases among the general population were in those > 70 years of age ( 4 ) . also , as indicated by the first nations and inuit regional health survey , the majority ( 53% ) of those with diabetes in aboriginal communities were < 40 years of age ( 28 ) . compared to general population , diabetes grew approximately twice as much among status aboriginal youth . ethnic comparisons have remained largely unexplored in youth , despite numerous studies documenting the divergence in diabetes epidemiology in adult populations . in the beginning of adss observation 1995 , incidence and prevalence of diabetes were distinctly higher among general population . by 2007 however , status aboriginal youth have  caught up to the point where no detectable differences were apparent , likely ( as mentioned above ) due to type 2 diabetes . reinforcing this notion , a recent national surveillance study amongst practicing physicians found the incidence of type 2 diabetes among aboriginal children ( 0.23/1,000 ) was strikingly 46-fold higher than caucasian children ( 0.005/1,000 ) over a 24 month period ( 29 ) . we observed an increased rise of diabetes among young status aboriginal males , confirming earlier studies . sex ratios of prevalence and incidence ( female : male ) of approximately 4:1 and 2:1 in 1995 decreased to 1:1 and 1:1 respectively in 2007 . additionally , the aapc in prevalence was highest amongst status aboriginal males ( aapc 9.18 ) compared to females ( aapc 5.70 ) . over a 15 year time period in manitoba , the early predominance of youth diabetes cases among aboriginal females ( 8-fold compared to males ) disappeared by 2001 ( 10 ) . from 1990 to 1998 , american indian and alaskan native young males also experienced relative increases in diabetes prevalence almost double that of their female counterparts ( 30 ) . similarly , the gap in diabetes prevalence between adult status aboriginal females and males is also diminishing ( 4,5 ) . reasons for the accelerated rise of diabetes among status aboriginal males have not been explored , but may be due in - part to escalating childhood overweight and obesity ( 31 ) with a possible gender - based lag in the obesity epidemic where it may have occurred earlier in time amongst females . in countries with universal healthcare , administrative data have become common and invaluable sources for the population - based surveillance of many chronic diseases . ndss methodology has been validated in adults and youth , and is a standard for diabetes monitoring at the population level ( 16,18,32,33 ) . for instance , guttmann et al . ( 33 ) recently found the ndss algorithm in youth ( 019 years of age ) in ontario was associated with 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity . using a similar algorithm ( 4 physician claims over a 2-year period ) , diabetes prevalence rose from 0.18 to 0.24 and incidence ( per 1,000 ) increased from 0.25 to 0.32 among ontarian youth between 1994 and 2003 ( 32 ) . in support , general population youth in the current study experienced nearly identical increases in prevalence and incidence between 1995 and 2003 : 0.19 to 0.25 and 0.22 to 0.32 ( per 1,000 ) respectively , with rates progressively increasing until the end of the study period in 2007 . we are unable to distinguish the type of diabetes in our administrative data . however , our clinical experience suggest that the majority of the diabetes in aboriginal youth is type 2 diabetes , whereas in the non - aboriginal population it is heavily dominated by type 1 diabetes . moreover , rates of type 1 diabetes are much lower among american indian and canadian aboriginal youth compared to the general population historically ( 34 ) . future research aimed at describing the contribution of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes to the observed trends is warranted . possible gestational diabetes cases were included and may have inflated rates in status aboriginal as gestational diabetes has been shown to be more common in adult aboriginal populations ( 35 ) . it is possible that increased awareness and screening in youth may have contributed to the observed increases , however for various projects ( http//:www.braiddm.ca ) we have screened 799 youth at risk ( mostly aboriginal ) in rural alberta since 2001 and have found only 3 ( 0.4% ) of those had undiagnosed diabetes ( unpublished ) . by contrast , the rates of undiagnosed diabetes are approximately 4% in at risk adults . thus , it appears that diabetes in youth is not often asymptomatic , and therefore is less likely to be detected by increased awareness and screening . our results can not be generalized to non - registered aboriginal or mtis youth , whom could not be identified and were included in the general population group . also , due to the small number of diabetes cases in youth , age - standardized prevalence and incidence rates were not calculated and only crude rates were reported . lastly , amendments to the indian act in 1985 are possibly increasing the status aboriginal denominator ( bill c-31 ) and likewise some descendants of status aboriginal people are losing their status through the  three generations  rule ( 36 ) . taken together , prudence is needed when interpreting the observed epidemiological findings . in conclusion , diabetes prevalence and incidence has increased among all alberta youth from 1995 to 2007 . status aboriginal youth , males in particular , experienced a disproportionate growth in diabetes . if unabated , increasing diabetes in youth will likely only further perpetuate the diabetes epidemic in the status aboriginal population . type 2 diabetes is typically the  tip of the iceberg as it is often preceded by several co - morbidities ( obesity , hypertension , metabolic syndrome , pre - diabetes , etc ) , rendering its increased diagnosis in youth a potential public health crisis . this work was supported in part by a team grant to the alliance for canadian health outcomes research in diabetes ( achord ; reference # : otg-88588 ) , sponsored by the canadian institutes for health research institute of nutrition , metabolism and diabetes . this study is based in part on de - identified data provided by the alberta health and wellness .","objectivesto track and compare trends in diabetes rates from 1995 to 2007 for status aboriginal and general population youth.study designlongitudinal observational research study ( quantitative ) using provincial administrative data.methodsde-identified data was obtained from alberta health and wellness administrative databases for status aboriginal ( first nations and inuit people with treaty status ) and general population youth ( < 20 years ) .

"the esthetic demand for restorative treatments that reestablish natural teeth s aspects is a major concern in dentistry.1 among the available options , ceramic restorations are an excellent alternative because of advantages , such as aesthetic , biocompatibility , chemical durability , fluorescence , compression and wear resistance , and thermal expansion coefficient similar to the dental structure.25 advances in resin - based cements and adhesive systems technology allowed the increase of clinical applications of all - ceramic restorations.6,7 replicating the appearance of natural tooth structure requires careful control of the form , surface texture , translucency , and color of the restoration.8 laboratory procedures that involve ceramic brand and batches,810 ceramic firing temperature and number of firings , and the condensation technique1113 also could affect the final shade of the porcelain . therefore , the color of the ceramic chosen may not correspond to the exact color of the tooth.14 laboratory procedures involved in the construction of porcelain inlays , onlays , all - ceramic crowns , and veneer restorations demand the use of refractory dies of dental phosphate - bonded investment materials that are used to build , sinter , cast , and press these types of restorations.7,15,16 when fabricating metal - free feldspathic ceramic restorations with the refractory die technique , the application and high burning temperature of the ceramic are accomplished in direct contact with dental phosphate - bonded refractory die products . 7,15 therefore , the ceramic is subjected to the influence of the investment according to its composition , surface , and physical - chemical properties.17,18 although several studies have analyzed the mechanical properties of refractory phosphate - bonded investment materials,16,2025 investment influence on the final color of ceramics remains unclear17,18,26 and deserves further investigation . because color is considered a sensation obtained through proprioceptive mechanisms , and thus considered subjective , standardized colorimetric techniques were developed with the objective of transforming colors in numeric values.8 for this aim , the cie l*a*b system of colors was created,19 eliminating inconsistencies inherent in color perception and specification among observers.8 this type of evaluation becomes important as the investment / ceramic relationship constitutes the base of the process of manufacturing ceramic restorations and is directly related to the final aesthetic quality of this type of restoration.7,15 the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of investment type on the color of various conventional powder - slurry feldspathic ceramics . the null hypothesis tested assumed that there would be no color alteration in the ceramics for all investments tested . an auto - polymerized acrylic resin mold was machined as a master die for the fabrication of multiple specimens and duplicated with an elastic jelly ( duplicator vipi , pirassununga , sao paulo , brazil ) . each investment was placed into the jelly moulds , obtaining cylindrical refractory dies , with a central depression with a diameter of 11 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm , where the ceramics were applied and fired , simulating a refractory die for fabrication of ceramic restorations . the investment was removed from the elastic jelly moulds after 1 hour to acquire appropriate resistance . the investment materials were mixed in a vacuum investor ( model a 300 ;

therefore , the greater the l * , the lighter the specimen . the a * coordinate is a measure of the chroma along the red - green axis . a positive a * relates to the amount of redness , and a negative a * relates to the amount of green of the specimen . the b * coordinate is a measure of the chroma along the yellow - blue axis , where a positive b * relates to the amount of yellowness , and a negative b * relates to the amount of blue of the specimen . the measure of the total difference of color among 2 objects is described by e . the formula used to calculate the e was : eab * = [ ( l * ) 2 + ( a * ) 2 + ( b * ) 2]1/2 . the e values are graded as follows : e < 1 = not appreciable , e < 2 = clinically acceptable , e > 2 = clinically unacceptable , and e > 3.7 = clinically unacceptable with very poor match.2729 the l*a*b * color notation of each specimen was measured thrice consecutively , and an average was calculated to give the initial color of all substrates . the formula used to calculate the lightness is : l * = l*f  l*i , with f representing the final value of l * and i the initial value of l * ( control group ) . statistical analyses were done , with the significance level fixed at 5% , and analyzed by two - way anova , followed by tukey post hoc test . the influence of the different investments was analyzed on the final color of the ceramic specimens . an auto - polymerized acrylic resin mold was machined as a master die for the fabrication of multiple specimens and duplicated with an elastic jelly ( duplicator vipi , pirassununga , sao paulo , brazil ) . each investment was placed into the jelly moulds , obtaining cylindrical refractory dies , with a central depression with a diameter of 11 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm , where the ceramics were applied and fired , simulating a refractory die for fabrication of ceramic restorations . the investment was removed from the elastic jelly moulds after 1 hour to acquire appropriate resistance . the investment materials were mixed in a vacuum investor ( model a 300 ;

therefore , a significant influence of the investment can be expected on the color of the ceramics , resulting in chromatic alterations that may lead to clinically unacceptable results . although phosphate - bonded dental casting investment materials have been successfully used in dentistry for more than 40 years , they still present characteristics that remain unclear.24 dental refractory die products are used to construct models and dies for casting dental alloys and ceramic restorations.16 a variety of factors have an important role on the appropriate performance of the investment materials that include their setting and thermal expansion,20 mould temperature,30 air bubbles pores,25 casting procedures,31 investment technique,15 and deformation of investment materials at high temperatures.16 in relation to procedures for casting dental alloys , certain defects in the final metal dental alloy superstructures may result from the casting process , such as porosity due to poor filling , shrinkage , or dissolved gases ; chemical segregation that results in nonuniform properties due to the physical chemistry of solidification ; and contamination due to mould - casting interactions.32 despite the few studies in the literature that evaluated investment influence on ceramic properties , 18,26 the surface of investment materials are shown to react with the ceramics and affect the surface and shrinkage crystallization,26,33 surface roughness,17 biaxial flexural strength , and the fit of ceramic restorations.30 a rough or irregular texture surface will reflect an irregular and diffuse pattern of light , therefore modifying the color of aesthetic restorations.34 surface topography also can influence the color of the ceramic , especially the l * value.35 this pattern was verified in vision esthetic ceramic , which presented the higher e * , resulted mainly from the variation of l*. hence , color alterations detected in the ceramics tested in our study can be attributed to possible alterations in ceramic surface topography from the interaction with the refractory investment materials in high temperatures . despite all the laboratory and clinical factors that can interfere with the final color of ceramic restorations , color differences among ceramics with the same shade but from different manufacturers can occur.8 the results of this study corroborates these findings , as significant color differences were detected among the color parameters a * , b * , and l * when comparing the controls ( no contact with the investment materials ) of the five ceramics tested ( table 3 ) . in general , vintage halo ceramic used in the control group had the higher a * value ( higher red value ) , whereas vision esthetic and ips classic ceramics showed the lower a * values , with all ceramics presenting positive values . regarding parameter b * , vintage halo ceramic showed the higher b * values ( more yellow ) , whereas vitadur alpha and ips classic showed the lower b * values ( less yellow ) . when considering ceramics lightness , super porcelain ex , vision esthetic , and vintage halo were the lighter ceramics ( higher l * values ) ; however , vitadur alpha and ips classic were the darkest ceramics , presenting the smaller l * values . the choice of using a chromatic background was intended to simulate a typical clinical condition in which a chromatic underlying dental structure is present , and a ceramic veneer restoration is planned.36,37 the background color of an aesthetic restoration is more or less chromatic , and the thickness of the material can vary.36,38 the use of black and white backgrounds has been reported in several studies to standardize the collection of the color data , but this methodology can influence the final color of the ceramic.29 clinically , a composite restoration with a white cement base may appear lighter , more reddish , and more saturated than that with a dark background.38 this effect becomes smaller as the thickness of the sample increases.38 when increasing resin thickness , the resin may appear darker and less chromatic with a white background and lighter and more chromatic with a black background.39 therefore , a sample may be more or less chromatic depending on its thickness and whether the background is white or black.39 to enable the reproduction of indistinguishable restorations with a natural and esthetic aspect , mimicking the natural dentition , besides a perfect anatomy , texture , and marginal adaptation , the perfect final match in color must be achieved . little consideration has been given to the refractory die materials and the laboratory techniques used during the construction of ceramic restorations . a wide range of chromatic color alterations on veneering ceramics occurring through refractory die methods with investments was found . during the laboratorial process of constructing metal - free ceramic restorations with refractory die techniques , intimate contacts of the investments occur with the ceramic surfaces7,15 in high temperatures , contact that varies from some hours to days . therefore , it is interesting to develop studies that could explore the potential interactions that occur among these materials , especially the ones that can result in alterations of mechanical resistance , surface , and color of ceramics , which directly influence their quality and longevity . one of the limitations of this study is that there was no analysis of the composition and differences of thermal expansion coefficients among the investment materials and ceramics tested , which could have resulted in a better understanding of their influence on the performance of the unit investment - ceramic during the construction process of a ceramic restorations . in laboratorial practice , ceramics and refractory materials routinely used are usually purchased from independent manufacturers , with some combinations having different thermal expansion coefficients but generally not resulting in differences of performance from matched ceramic and refractory products.40 therefore , further investigations are necessary to evaluate the composition , structure , and performance relationships of these related systems because there are no recommendation protocols of combinations of these materials ( ceramics versus investments).40 notwithstanding that such information would be important in understanding the processes involved in the construction of ceramic restorations , a guideline for daily practice for product selection , specifying comparative or standard compliance tests , are mandatory . there was a significant influence of the investment refractory materials on the color parameters a * , b * , and l * on the ceramics tested , resulting in chromatic alterations unacceptable for some of the ceramic groups tested .","objectives : the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of investment type on the color of feldspathic ceramics.methods:ceramic specimens were constructed using the refractory die technique , using four investments ( i.e. , vitadurvest , duravest , duceralay superfit , and fortune ) to observe their effect on the color of five commercially available ceramics ( i.e. , super porcelain ex-3 , vision esthetic , vintage halo , ips classic , and vitadur alpha ) . 
 the color analysis of the ceramics was performed with a colorimeter using the cie l*a*b * color coordinates.results:the investments produced significant alterations on a * , b * , and l * color parameters of the ceramics tested . 
 the ceramic vision esthetic was influenced by the type of investment in all color parameters ( p<.05 ) . 
 two investments ( duravest and fortune ) produced alterations in color parameters with three of the five ceramics tested.conclusions:the investment materials produced alterations on the ceramic color parameters , resulting in unacceptable chromatic alterations ( e * ) .",218
"although s. pneumoniae is the most common cause of community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) in many countries , there are considerable geographic differences in the incidence of other pathogens . tuberculosis ( tb ) is often overlooked as a cause of cap , particularly when it presents as an acute illness ( 2 ) . although the presentation of pulmonary tb as acute pneumonia is not unusual , its manifestation as acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) is rare . ards is a severe form of diffuse alveolar injury . the american - european consensus conference ( aecc ) ( 1994 ) defined ards as an acute condition characterized by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia in the absence of evidence for cardiogenic pulmonary edema . the severity of hypoxemia necessary to make the diagnosis of ards was defined by the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in the patient s arterial blood ( pao2 ) to the fraction of oxygen in the inspired air ( fio2 ) . ards was defined by a pao2/fio2 ratio of less than 200 , and , in acute lung injury ( ali ) , by a ratio less than 300 ( 3 ) . recently , a panel of experts redefined the definition ( berlin definition ) ( 2011 ) and categorized ards into three levels : mild ( pao2/fio2 200300 ) , moderate ( pao2/fio2 100200 ) , and severe ( pao2/fio2 100 ) ( 4 ) . even though ali and ards are well recognized complications in patients with severe tb , such as miliary tb or tb bronchopneumonia , sparse epidemiological data are available on this entity . most patients who develop ali / ards have underlying chronic medical conditions or hiv infections , and their diagnoses were delayed ( 5 ) . herein , we present a rare case of a previously healthy young patient with acute pulmonary tuberculosis in the form of tb pneumonia that was complicated by ards . a 21-year - old woman , a radiology technician student , presented with acute respiratory failure due to progressive respiratory symptoms , including productive cough and dyspnea that started seven days before presentation . at the time of her admission to the hospital her initial vital signs were as follows : bp = 110/70 mmhg , hr = 122/min , rr = 40/min , and temperature = 40 c . lung examination revealed bilateral coarse crackles . because she presented during the influenza season and because the symptoms were compatible with severe pneumonia , a broad spectrum of antibiotics and oseltamivir were started , and she was intubated and received mechanical ventilation . there was no history of previous illness or recent travel and no family history of note . arterial blood gas revealed hypoxemia ( pao2 = 24.3 mmhg ) , hypercapnia ( paco2 = 55.1 mmhg ) , and respiratory acidosis ( ph = 7.25 , hco3 : 26 ) . the hiv test was negative . based on an initial pao2/fio2 ratio of less than 100 on ventilator setting that included peep and characteristic diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest x - ray ( figure 1 ) , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) bacterial and fungal cultures of respiratory secretions showed no growth after seven days . a real - time pcr test on respiratory specimens for influenza a and b was negative . accordingly , diagnosis of ards secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis was made , and the patient received anti - tuberculous drugs and intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg three times per day . the patient continued to improve gradually during the first week , and she was successfully weaned and extubated on her seventh day in the hospital . her chest infiltrates gradually resolved during the first week , but left lower- and mid - zone consolidation remained ( figure 3 ) . she remained hospitalized in the infectious ward and received o2 therapy plus anti - tuberculous drugs for another 15 days . corticosteroids were stopped . during this period she remained mildly tachypnic and hypoxic . on the 24 day after presentation , she was discharged with stable vital signs and no hypoxia in the room air . a 21-year - old woman , a radiology technician student , presented with acute respiratory failure due to progressive respiratory symptoms , including productive cough and dyspnea that started seven days before presentation . at the time of her admission to the hospital her initial vital signs were as follows : bp = 110/70 mmhg , hr = 122/min , rr = 40/min , and temperature = 40 c . lung examination revealed bilateral coarse crackles . because she presented during the influenza season and because the symptoms were compatible with severe pneumonia , a broad spectrum of antibiotics and oseltamivir were started , and she was intubated and received mechanical ventilation . there was no history of previous illness or recent travel and no family history of note . arterial blood gas revealed hypoxemia ( pao2 = 24.3 mmhg ) , hypercapnia ( paco2 = 55.1 mmhg ) , and respiratory acidosis ( ph = 7.25 , hco3 : 26 ) . the hiv test was negative . based on an initial pao2/fio2 ratio of less than 100 on ventilator setting that included peep and characteristic diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest x - ray ( figure 1 ) , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) bacterial and fungal cultures of respiratory secretions showed no growth after seven days . a real - time pcr test on respiratory specimens for influenza a and b was negative . accordingly , diagnosis of ards secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis was made , and the patient received anti - tuberculous drugs and intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg three times per day . the patient continued to improve gradually during the first week , and she was successfully weaned and extubated on her seventh day in the hospital . her chest infiltrates gradually resolved during the first week , but left lower- and mid - zone consolidation remained ( figure 3 ) . she remained hospitalized in the infectious ward and received o2 therapy plus anti - tuberculous drugs for another 15 days . corticosteroids were stopped . during this period she remained mildly tachypnic and hypoxic . on the 24 day after presentation , she was discharged with stable vital signs and no hypoxia in the room air . this case features a rare manifestation of pulmonary tuberculosis in a previously healthy young woman with acute presentation of tuberculous pneumonia complicated by ards . tuberculous pneumonia is defined as nodular lesions resulting from air - space consolidation due to endobronchial spread to lobar or multilobar locations ( 5 ) . m. tuberculosis is an important cause of community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) in developing countries . tb can present as an acute process and should be included in the differential diagnosis of cap . it may mimic classic bacterial pneumonia or masquerade as an atypical pneumonia , with non - productive cough and systemic symptoms . missed diagnosis is common , as illustrated in report from baltimore in which 16 of 33 patients ( 48% ) with culture - confirmed pulmonary tb were treated initially for presumed cap ( 1 ) . the incidence of tb being diagnosed among patients presenting with clinical and radiological signs of a cap has varied in different series . previously , studies from china , japan , kenya , and sub saharan africa also demonstrated high prevalence of pulmonary tb ( 920.5% ) in patients who presented with cap ( 611 ) . m. tuberculosis was the second most common pathogen ( 12% ) identified in the study performed by levy et al . , only patients who presented with features of acute pneumonia were included ; those with chronic illness or typical radiologic changes suggestive of tb were excluded . a similar high incidence of tb ( 10% ) among subjects presenting with acute pneumonia was reported in france ( 7 ) . although presentation of pulmonary tb as acute pneumonia is not unusual , its manifestation as ards is rare . this complication is associated with a very high mortality ( 4080% ) despite treatment ( 5 ) . even in a large study from india that was conducted by agarwal et al , tb accounted for only 4.9% of patients ( 9 of 187 ) who were admitted with a diagnosis of ards over a 7-year period , of whom two patients died . the lower mortality rate in this study could be attributed to the fact that all subjects were started empirically on anti - tb therapy with the median time to initiation of therapy being three days . tracheal aspirate sent for ziehl - neelsen staining did not indicate that there were acid - fast bacilli in any of the patients of this study ( 13 ) . in another study by sharma et al . in india , of 2,733 tb patients treated during 19802003 , 29 ( 1.06% , i.e. , 1.21 patients / year ) developed ards ( 14 ) . another large retrospective study conducted by deng et al . in china over a five - year period ( 20062010 ) showed that , among 16,238 patients who were admitted to the respiratory departments with a diagnosis of pulmonary tb , 471 patients were diagnosed as having miliary tb , of whom 85 developed ards and were admitted to the icu during the study period . the mortality rate in this study was 47.1% , and the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 8.5  3.0 days in all patients ( 15 ) . another study from south korea described 67 patients with ards caused by miliary tb admitted to the icu during 19992008 . all - cause mortalities in the icu and the hospital were 58.2 and 61.2% , respectively . in their study , 28.4% of the patients were older than 71 , but clinical outcomes in these patients did not differ significantly from outcomes in younger patients ( 16 ) . ( 17 ) found that higher psi scores were independently associated with the presence of concomitant pulmonary tb in both health care associated pneumonia ( hcap ) and cap patients . in the study performed by levy et al . ( 18 ) , the incidence rate of 1.5% was reported for acute respiratory failure among hospitalized patients who presented with tuberculous cap . although ards invariably occurs in patients with severe tb , such as miliary tb or tb bronchopneumonia ( 5 ) , its occurrence in tuberculous pneumonia and cavitary pulmonary tb also was described ( 5 ) . in the study of agarwal et al . , radiography of eight of nine patients with tb and ards revealed miliary nodules , and consolidation was observed in only one patient ( 13 ) . seven out of 29 patients with tb and ards in the study of sharma et al . had pulmonary tb , and 22 had miliary tb ( 14 ) . several predisposing factors for development of ards in tb patients and several prognostic factors in these patients have been described . according to the study of deng et al . , the duration of time to diagnosis , time from diagnosis to mechanical ventilation , and time to anti - tuberculosis therapy were significantly shorter in survivors than for non - survivors . diabetes mellitus , increased ast , alt , and d - dimer , decreased hemoglobin , and albumin were found to be independent predictors of the development of ards in the setting of miliary tb ( 15 ) . in the study reported by sharma et al . , the presence of miliary tb , duration of illness beyond 30 days at presentation , absolute lymphocyte count less than 1625/mm and serum alt greater than 100 iu / l were independent predictors of the development of ards . patients with apache ii scores > 18 , those with apache ii scores < 18 in the presence of hyponatraemia , and those with pao2/fio2 ratios < 108.5 were likely to die ( 14 ) . showed that the sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) score on the day that ards is diagnosed is a valuable prognostic indicator ( 16 ) . the case presented is special in its manifestation from several clinical perspectives , including lack of underlying medical condition or immune defect and development of ards in non - miliary and non - disseminated tuberculosis . in conclusion , the diagnosis of tb should be considered in all patients who present with cap in our region . it has been suggested that , in a patient with unexplained ards , a history of fever of more than 15 days duration and elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase should arouse the suspicion of disseminated tb as the underlying cause ( 5 ) . it also has been suggested that , in patients with ards of obscure etiology where the clinical features suggest tb as the inciting cause , anti - tb therapy should be started empirically , and the diagnosis actively pursued later ( 13 ) . both primary and reactivation tb may present as an acute illness and mimic cap . as a result of the impressive mimicry of tb , the diagnosis must be considered , at least initially , in all cases of acute pneumonitis , especially in regions where tuberculosis is endemic .","the presented case features a rare manifestation of pulmonary tuberculosis in a previously healthy young woman who had acute presentation of tuberculous pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome . in developing countries 
 , mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important cause of community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) . 
 tb can present as an acute process and should be included in the differential diagnosis of cap . 
 this case is special in its manifestation from several clinical perspectives , including the lack of an underlying medical condition or immune defect and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) in non - miliary and non - disseminated tuberculosis . in conclusion 
 , the diagnosis of tb should be considered in all patients who present with cap in endemic regions .",144
"immune hemolysis is a shortening of red blood cell survival due , directly or indirectly to antibodies . it is necessary to identify these atypical antibodies in the patient s serum in order to select appropriate blood for transfusion . even in the most vexing situation encountered by a transfusion specialist where no compatible units are available for a patient with severe anemia transfusion requirement should be considered as a medical emergency even if serologic testing is incomplete . a 20-year - old female was referred to our hospital with complaints of icterus and breathlessness . she had similar complaints one year back and was treated for jaundice by a local physician . prior to her referral , she had been transfused three units of ab positive blood over one week . on general physical examination , there was mild leucocytosis and blood film showed autoagglutination with the presence of nucleated red cells ( 19/100 wbcs ) . plasma and urine hemoglobin were raised . direct antiglobulin test with poly - specific coomb 's reagent ( igg + c3d ) ( tulip diagnostics ) was positive . patient also had a positive antibody screen with all three reagent cells in the anti - human globulin test ( ortho cell panel , ortho diagnostics ) . since the patient had life - threatening anemia with urgent requirement for transfusion , detailed phenotyping was not done and crossmatching was performed with several random a rh - positive packed red cells but no compatible unit was detected . she received three  least incompatible a rh - positive non - leuco reduced packed red cell units over three days as a life - saving measure after informed consent . no adverse events were reported during or after transfusion . besides , she was also started on steroid therapy , antibiotics and diuretics . however , she developed sudden cardiorespiratory arrest on fifth day and could not be revived . the patient was a case of coronary artery disease with off and on gastric bleed and a recipient of multiple transfusions in the past . peripheral blood smear showed dimorphic blood picture with moderate anisocytosis and poikilocytosis with mild hypochromia , microcytes , macro - ovalocytes and polychromasia . blood group was o rh - positive and two units of o rh - positive packed cells were transfused . since there was not much improvement in hemoglobin , another transfusion was requested but crossmatch was incompatible and antibody screen was positive . there was a difference in the strength of reaction at different phases and auto - control was negative . antibody identification studies suggested anti e , jka and s as the implicating antibodies ( patient e- , jka- and s- ) . strong possibility of anti e was considered on 11 cell identification panel results . meanwhile , patient improved clinically and was discharged at hemoglobin of 10.5 gm / dl with no further requirement for transfusion . subsequently , he was readmitted with another bout of hematemesis and hemoglobin of 6.4 gm / dl . patient received two transfusions by standard compatibility testing procedure since the blood bank was not informed about his previous immuno - hematological work up and hence a phenotypically matched blood was not given . however , there was a reaction with the first unit in the form of fever and mild jaundice ( serum bilirubin 2.2 mg / dl ) , which recovered subsequently . a 20-year - old female was referred to our hospital with complaints of icterus and breathlessness . she had similar complaints one year back and was treated for jaundice by a local physician . prior to her referral , she had been transfused three units of ab positive blood over one week . on general physical examination , there was mild leucocytosis and blood film showed autoagglutination with the presence of nucleated red cells ( 19/100 wbcs ) . plasma and urine hemoglobin were raised . direct antiglobulin test with poly -

hematological work up and hence a phenotypically matched blood was not given . however , there was a reaction with the first unit in the form of fever and mild jaundice ( serum bilirubin 2.2 mg / dl ) , which recovered subsequently . autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a fairly uncommon disorder with estimates of the incidence at 13 cases per 100 000 per year . in contrast , alloimmune hemolytic anemia requires exposure to allogeneic red cells through pregnancy , transfusion or transplantation . the incidence of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions has been estimated to be 0.0030.008% , while 0.050.07% of transfused patients develop a clinically recognized delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.[46 ] delayed serologic transfusion reactions are more common and are a frequent finding in patients who receive multiple transfusions . anemia is of variable severity and some patients present with fulminant hemolysis , jaundice , pallor , hemoglobinuria and hepatosplenomegaly . in the first case , the patient was erroneously grouped and transfused ab positive blood before referral to our center . she presented with severe life - threatening anemia , jaundice , mild hepatosplenomegaly and evidence of hemolysis . approximately 57% of patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia have free serum autoantibody and a positive indirect antiglobulin test . due to pan agglutinin in the serum of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia , crossmatching blood is a difficult and time - consuming process since the pan agglutinin reacts with all donors red blood cells .. moreover , the most pressing problem is detection and identification of rbc alloantibodies that may be masked by the autoantibodies . in our patient , the anemia was life threatening with time constraints to perform adsorption studies with subsequent identification of underlying alloantibodies . even after thorough serological evaluation , the optimal blood for transfusion is still likely to be mismatched . clinical reluctance to administer transfusions to such patients due to serological mismatch or an incomplete workup can have devastating consequences . factors such as rate of onset of hemolysis and anemia , presence or absence of accompanying hypovolemia and the underlying health status and cardiorespiratory reserve must be taken into account to determine the transfusion trigger . when a decision to transfuse mismatched blood is taken , transfusion of small aliquots to provide relief of symptoms and avoid fluid overload has been recommended . it has also been recommended to transfuse using leucocyte - reduced blood products and pre - medication with antihistaminics and antipyretics to prevent febrile and allergic reactions , respectively , in patients with multiple antibodies . the second patient was a recipient of multiple transfusions with difficulty in finding a compatible unit . antibody screen was positive with difference in the strength of reaction in immediate spin , 37c , and in the antihuman globulin phase . the patient had multiple alloantibodies , which did not cause any clinical evidence of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction except mild subclinical jaundice . however , in spite of repeated transfusions , there was not much improvement in the hemoglobin . the reason could be that the antibody titer was low initially but subsequent to transfusion , an anamnestic response led to rise in antibody titer and hence subsequent crossmatching did not give a compatible unit . when the patient 's sample was received in the first instance , crossmatch was compatible . the incidence of alloimmunization in random multi - transfused patients has been reported to be 034%.[1519 ] it is more in transfusion - dependent patients , such as those with sickle cell disease , aplastic anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome and other congenital or acquired anemia . in a prospective study on the incidence of red cell alloimmunization following transfusion , 8.4% of patients developed antibodies within 24 weeks of transfusion . takeuchi and coworkers have reported a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction due to anti e , anti c and anti jka that are clinically significant antibodies . such patients present a challenge for elective transfusions particularly if multiple clinically significant alloantibodies are present . if such a situation arises , transfusion should be withheld until suitable antigen - negative donor units are located . patients with multiple alloantibodies should receive phenotypically matched red blood cells to avoid transfusion reaction and they should be given a card indicating the antibody specificities so that he can receive antigen negative blood . in either case , a good communication must be established between the clinician and the transfusion specialist to assess the clinical urgency and the complexity of serological studies . the final decision to transfuse should depend on the evaluation of the patient 's clinical status and the benefits must be weighed to the potential risks of transfusion .","the transfusion - medicine specialists and physicians are often in a difficult situation when the patient has severe worsening anemia and all the blood is mismatched . 
 this situation can arise in patients with red cell autoantibodies or alloantibodies due to previous transfusions . 
 we report two cases of immune hemolysis 
 one due to warm auto antibodies and the second due to alloimmunization from multiple transfusions .",85
"a cross - sectional and longitudinal study was conducted that included 22 medical clinics ( i.e. , general practitioners ) or general / university - affiliated hospitals from different areas in japan , using the same software ( codic ) to compile electronic medical records , as a working study group , the japan diabetes clinical data management ( jddm ) study ( 9 ) . a detailed description of the study has been published previously ( 9,10 ) . all consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes who visited each clinic / hospital between 2000 and 2009 and whose diabetes was diagnosed before 2009 were included ( n = 45,876 ) . in total , 4,798 drug - naive patients were recruited on their first visits between 2000 and 2009 from across japan . all patients met the japan diabetes association criteria for type 2 diabetes ( 11 ) . all case participants had their height , weight , hba1c , blood pressure ( bp ) , and lipids measured . bmi was calculated as weight ( kg ) divided by height squared ( m ) . waist circumference ( wc ) was assessed at the top of the iliac crest at the end of a normal expiration ( 12 ) . the jddm protocol , which is in accordance with the declaration of helsinki , received ethical approval from the institutional review boards of all of the participating institutions and was undertaken in accordance with the ethical guidelines for clinical studies of the japanese ministry of health , labor , and welfare . the morning after an overnight fast , venous blood was sampled for the baseline measurements of the hba1c level and plasma concentrations of glucose , ldl cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides ( tgs ) , creatinine , and insulin . hba1c , expressed in national glycohemoglobin standardization program units , was measured by high - performance liquid chromatography . plasma total cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and tgs were assessed with standard enzymatic spectrophotometric techniques . ( 13 ) , except when tgs exceeded 400 mg / dl ( in that case , data were treated as missing ) . albumin concentrations in random spot urine samples were determined by turbidimetric immunoassay , and creatinine levels were determined by the enzymatic method . the abbott imx insulin assay ( dainabot ; abbott laboratories , tokyo , japan ) is used to quantitatively measure insulin at bml , inc . this assay shows no cross - reactivity with proinsulin ( < 0.005% ) . within the assay , for every year , the coefficients of variation at mean values of 59.6 and 873.8 the following three mrfs were evaluated as defined by the revised national cholesterol education program criteria ( 14 ) and the world health organization criteria for asia ( 15 ) : 1 ) wc 80 cm ( men ) or 75 cm ( women ) ; 2 ) systolic bp 130 mmhg , diastolic bp 85 mmhg , or antihypertensive medications ; and 3 ) hdl cholesterol < 1.04 mmol / l , tgs 1.68 mmol / l , or lipid medications . sex , age , bmi , wc , mean bp , hba1c , fasting insulin , tgs , ldl cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and microalbuminuria were compared by five consecutive 2-year periods from 2000 to 2009 using one - way anova and the bonferroni post hoc test . statistical analyses included the unpaired student t test , one - way anova , the  test for categorical variables , univariate linear correlations , and ancova . multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess variables that were independently associated with variations in fasting insulin levels . both fasting insulin and bmi differences over this 10-year term were assessed using ancova to adjust for potential confounders ( sex , age , and fasting plasma glucose [ fpg ] ) . the morning after an overnight fast , venous blood was sampled for the baseline measurements of the hba1c level and plasma concentrations of glucose , ldl cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides ( tgs ) , creatinine , and insulin . hba1c , expressed in national glycohemoglobin standardization program units , was measured by high - performance liquid chromatography . plasma total cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and tgs were assessed with standard enzymatic spectrophotometric techniques . ( 13 ) , except when tgs exceeded 400 mg / dl ( in that case , data were treated as missing ) . albumin concentrations in random spot urine samples were determined by turbidimetric immunoassay , and creatinine levels were determined by the enzymatic method . the abbott imx insulin assay ( dainabot ; abbott laboratories , tokyo , japan ) is used to quantitatively measure insulin at bml , inc . this assay shows no cross - reactivity with proinsulin ( < 0.005% ) . within the assay , for every year , the coefficients of variation at mean values of 59.6 and 873.8 pmol / l were 4 and 2.5% , respectively . between assays , the coefficients of variation at mean values of 59.6 and 872.4 the following three mrfs were evaluated as defined by the revised national cholesterol education program criteria ( 14 ) and the world health organization criteria for asia ( 15 ) : 1 ) wc 80 cm ( men ) or 75 cm ( women ) ; 2 ) systolic bp 130 mmhg , diastolic bp 85 mmhg , or antihypertensive medications ; and 3 ) hdl cholesterol < 1.04 mmol / l , tgs 1.68 mmol / l , or lipid medications . sex , age , bmi , wc , mean bp , hba1c , fasting insulin , tgs , ldl cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and microalbuminuria were compared by five consecutive 2-year periods from 2000 to 2009 using one - way anova and the bonferroni post hoc test . statistical analyses included the unpaired student t test , one - way anova , the  test for categorical variables , univariate linear correlations , and ancova . multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess variables that were independently associated with variations in fasting insulin levels . both fasting insulin and bmi differences over this 10-year term were assessed using ancova to adjust for potential confounders ( sex , age , and fasting plasma glucose [ fpg ] ) . comparisons between groups were analyzed for five consecutive 2-year periods versus each variable value in 20002001 , when observation began . sex , age , mean bp , and the prevalence of mrfs ( % wc , hypertension , and dyslipidemia ) did not differ significantly among year groups . waist circumference ( cm ) and bmi were significantly different in the 20062007 and 20082009 groups . fpg , hba1c , fasting insulin , and tgs were significantly different in each group in 2002 and thereafter . compared with 20002001 , the bmi increased significantly in 2006 and later , but the difference was slight . blood pressure did not change during the 10-year period . for lipids , compared with 20002001 , tgs increased in 2002 and thereafter . as a visual representation of this study , profile plots were created showing the estimated marginal means for the fasting insulin levels / bmi values in each of the 2-year groups ( fig . further analysis using ancova adjusted for age and fpg showed differences among year groups , with an increase in bmi and a decrease in fasting insulin ( p < 0.001 ) . in each year group , bmi and fasting insulin values in females were higher than in males ( p < 0.001 ) . multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting fasting insulin levels ( table 2 ) . factors that significantly affected the fasting insulin value , in order of greater  , were wc , bmi , year group , mean bp , hdl cholesterol , tgs , and microalbuminuria . the factors most affecting fasting insulin were wc and bmi , but even after correction for sex , age , and hba1c , the values decreased during the 10-year period . there was also a highly linear relationship between wc and bmi ( r = 0.87 , p < 0.001 ) . patients ' characteristics for each 2-year group estimated marginal mean for ancova results among year groups for fasting insulin ( a ) and bmi ( b ) . covariates in each model were evaluated based on age = 56.7 years and fpg = 9.1 pmol / l . in this 10-year study of drug - naive japanese diabetic patients evaluated at their first clinic / hospital visit , fasting insulin levels were found to decrease over time , with wc and bmi being the most important factors after corrections . from 2000 to 2009 , when the current study was conducted , a diabetes status survey in japan also estimated an increase in the number of diabetic patients , from 6.9 to 12.5 million ( 3 ) . it is clear that , in the last 10 years , the insulin secretion ability of japanese individuals has gradually decreased each year . the reason for this is the following changes that were observed in mrfs that play a role in insulin resistance . as mrfs , in the current study , the relationships with wc , bmi , bp , lipids , and microalbuminuria were examined . the factors most involved with the decrease in fasting insulin levels were wc and bmi . fasting insulin levels were affected by age , sex , and hba1c . even after adjustment for these , based on our study , the role of mrfs ( wc , bmi , bp , lipids , and microalbuminuria ) seems important in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in japanese individuals . the asia - pacific region has been considered to be the major site of a rapidly emerging epidemic of diabetes ( 16 ) , and with its large populations , it is of prime importance for the epidemiology of diabetes . approximately 13.5% of the japanese population now has either type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance ( 17 ) . furthermore , it is thought that westernization of the lifestyle and an increased percentage of fat in the diet play a role in increasing insulin resistance ( 18 ) . in asian populations , the -cells may lose their ability to compensate for the decrease in insulin sensitivity seen with the development of central adiposity . loss of -cell function has been demonstrated to appear before the development of the obesity - induced decreased insulin sensitivity among subpopulations of japanese and japanese americans who develop type 2 diabetes ( 19,20 ) . the japanese have a higher prevalence of polymorphisms for at least three genes that code for proteins thought to play key roles in lipid and glucose metabolism : the 3-adrenergic receptor , the peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor  , and calpain-10 ( 18,21 ) . the interaction between changes in lifestyle and the  thrifty  genotype characteristic of many japanese people may play a significant role in the increasing prevalence of diabetes and associated cardiovascular risk in this population . although this type of genetic background has not changed , compared with 30 years ago , dietary habits have become westernized with a high - fat diet . surprisingly , the daily calorie intake has not changed over the last 50 years and remains at ~2,000 kcal . however , 50 years ago , when a traditional japanese diet was consumed , the percentage of fat in the calorie intake was ~7% , but now it is > 27% , a sudden , almost fourfold increase in only 50 years ( 3 ) . therefore , an imbalance with the characteristic japanese insulin secretion ability has developed . as a result , the current state of obesity and poor insulin effectiveness has become very significant . since japanese people with their lower insulin secretion ability can not completely compensate for this , the prevalence of diabetes is increasing dramatically . in addition , it has been shown that japanese americans have experienced a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than in japan . research conducted in seattle , wa , suggests that lifestyle factors associated with westernization play a role in exacerbating this susceptibility to diabetes ( 22 ) . bmi is a strong determinant of insulin resistance , and it is concordant with the evidence that the mean bmis of representative epidemiologic studies of japanese diabetic patients are from 23 to 25 kg / m lower than in the studies of other ethnic populations ( 23,24 ) . bmi and wc thresholds vary among ethnicities , and values are lower for asian populations . local and regional data have shown that the same level of bmi connotes a greater degree of obesity in asians compared with caucasians ( 25 ) , and that asians are prone to disorders such as diabetes , hypertension , and dyslipidemia at lower levels of bmi than caucasian populations ( 25 ) . the use of bmi as a measure of body proportion is a limitation because of its inability to provide information on body fat distribution and central adiposity . the current study also indicates that , for japanese , a slight increase in wc / bmi may be as informative with regard to diabetes risk due to decreasing fasting insulin levels . decreased -cell function and decreased insulin sensitivity are the two major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes . the ability of -cells to compensate for a decrease in insulin sensitivity enables these individuals to maintain normal glucose levels . the fundamental pathological sequence leading to type 2 diabetes is presumed to be the development of an obesity - induced decrease in insulin sensitivity followed by hyperglycemia when the -cells can no longer compensate ( 27 ) . however , it is still unknown whether -cell dysfunction ( 28 ) , decreased insulin sensitivity ( 29 ) , or a combination of both defects is the primary abnormality leading to type 2 diabetes ( 30 ) . although the risk factors for type 2 diabetes are similar among ethnically diverse populations , there are ethnic differences in insulin sensitivity and -cell function among groups at high risk for type 2 diabetes . since the study design was cross - sectional , causal relationships can not be explored . first , as our study included only type 2 diabetic patients in diabetes clinics / hospitals , our findings can not be generalized to other patients in a typical practice or community population . also , fasting insulin levels are limited measures of insulin sensitivity and -cell function . other environmental or lifestyle factors , including dietary fat or fiber , alcohol consumption , physical activity , smoking , and socioeconomic status might be related to the decreasing trend in fasting insulin over the 10-year period . nevertheless , we have shown that fasting insulin levels in subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes have been decreasing progressively from 2000 to 2009 , and this decrease has been associated with an increase in mrfs , particularly wc and bmi . in conclusion , the superimposition of low pancreatic -cell reserve upon a lifestyle background of metabolic parameters appears to result in hyperglycemia and diabetes in japan .","objectiveto investigate the relationship between fasting insulin levels and metabolic risk factors ( mrfs ) in type 2 diabetic patients at the first clinic / hospital visit in japan over the years 2000 to 2009.research design and methodsin total , 4,798 drug - naive japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were registered on their first clinic / hospital visits . 
 conventional clinical factors and fasting insulin levels were observed at baseline within the japan diabetes clinical data management ( jddm ) study between consecutive 2-year groups . 
 multiple linear regression analysis was performed using a model in which the dependent variable was fasting insulin values using various clinical explanatory variables.resultsfasting insulin levels were found to be decreasing from 2000 to 2009 . 
 multiple linear regression analysis with the fasting insulin levels as the dependent variable showed that waist circumference ( wc ) , bmi , mean blood pressure , triglycerides , and hdl cholesterol were significant , with wc and bmi as the main factors . 
 ancova after adjustment for age and fasting plasma glucose clearly shows the decreasing trend in fasting insulin levels and the increasing trend in bmi.conclusionsduring the 10-year observation period , the decreasing trend in fasting insulin was related to the slight increase in wc / bmi in type 2 diabetes . 
 low pancreatic -cell reserve on top of a lifestyle background might be dependent on an increase in mrfs .",277
"sevoflurane has a low blood / gas partition coefficient and does not irritate the airways . inhalation induction should provide rapid loss of consciousness to ensure patient 's comfort and satisfaction and to avoid adverse effects such as excitations , breath holding , coughing and/or laryngospasm . several adjuvants and techniques have been proposed to ensure a rapid induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane , such as intravenous ( iv ) midazolam , clonidine , fentanyl , breathing different gas flows , or ventilation with larger tidal volumes . the effect of nitrous oxide ( n2o ) when added to the inhalation of sevoflurane in oxygen has been controversial . n2o added to oxygen was reported to make shorter the induction time with sevoflurane , an effect similar to that produced by clonidine . these results are not consistent with the results obtained from other studies , which conclude that the addition of n2o to the sevoflurane / oxygen mixture is not advantageous regarding the speed of induction of anesthesia . in contrast , results from previous studies point out that the addition of n2o to the sevoflurane / oxygen mixture may be associated with more , though minor , excitatory phenomena . our hypothesis was that the speed of inhalation induction with sevoflurane may benefit from the pretreatment with n2o , and subsequent volume contraction before sevoflurane administration . the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pretreatment with 50% n2o in oxygen on the speed of inhalation induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane in women undergoing minor gynecological procedures . the study was approved by the institutional review board ( n-79/04 - 04 - 06 ) . eighty patients american society of anesthesiology physical status i or ii scheduled for hysteroscopy under general anesthesia , who accepted an inhalation induction with no premedication , gave their written informed consent to participate in the study protocol . patients with body weight exceeding the ideal body weight by 25% , with central nervous system disease , respiratory disease , hyper - or hypothyroidism , intake of sedatives , hypnotics , and antidepressants were excluded from the study before randomization . patients were randomly allocated to the air ( fio2 = 0.21 ) or n2o ( n2o / o2:50/50 , fio2 = 0.5 ) group . randomization was done by means of odd and even numbers retrieved from a computer - generated table ( http://www.randomizer.org ) corresponding to the n2o and to the air group respectively . the pretreatment gas was administered via n2o - oxygen flow meters or an air flow meter connected to the wall pipelines , all covered by drapes so the investigators were blinded to the gas administered . group allocation to intervention was done by an independent anesthesiologist not participating in the study who arranged the gases before induction ( air or n2o / o2 ) , covered the flow meters with drapes and recorded the group each patient was assigned . in the operating room monitoring consisted of pulse oximetry , electrocardiogram , heart rate , noninvasive arterial pressure , end - tidal carbon dioxide ( etco2 ) , inspired and end - tidal sevoflurane concentrations , tidal volume and respiratory rate ( s/5 anesthesia monnitor , datex - ohmeda division , datex - ohmeda , helsinki , finland ) and bispectral index ( bis xp a-2000 monitor , system rev 3.21 , aspect medical systems , leiden , the netherlands ) . according to the group allocation , in the preinduction period patients were fully awake , breathing spontaneously either 50% n2o in oxygen ( fio2 = 0.5 ) or air ( fio2 = 0.21 ) for 10 min via a mapleson c breathing system and a tightly fitting face mask . the anesthetic circuit was primed with 8% sevoflurane : an oxygen flow 6 l / min was allowed to pass through the circle anesthetic system with the sevoflurane vaporizer dial being set at 8% for 5 min . an endotracheal tube was attached to the end of the anesthetic system with the distal end tightly surrounded by a plastic bag . after the completion of the 10 min administration of the n2o / oxygen or air , the face mask was connected to the sevoflurane primed anesthetic circuit and all patients were allowed to breathe spontaneously sevoflurane in oxygen with the sevoflurane vaporizer set at 8% and an oxygen flow rate 6 l / min . after a 5 min period of sevoflurane inhalation , the study protocol and data collection were completed . a short acting opioid was given iv and a supraglottic airway device was inserted for the ventilation of patients during surgery . during the 10 min preinduction period , bis , respiratory rate , tidal volume , etco2 , heart rate and oxygen saturation ( spo2 ) were recorded every minute . the same parameters were recorded every 30 s during the first 5 min induction period with the patient breathing sevoflurane in oxygen . during the induction period inspired and end - tidal sevoflurane concentrations were also recorded every 30 s. arterial blood pressure was recorded only before starting the pretreatment with the gas and after completion of measurements to avoid stimulus during cuff inflation affecting bis measurements . we hypothesized that the speed of inhalation induction with sevoflurane will be enhanced by n2o pretreatment , and possible subsequent volume contraction occurring before sevoflurane administration . bis was the primary outcome measure , the rest variables being secondary outcome measures . at each time point , three consecutive bis values were read and the median one was selected . initial sample size estimation showed that approximately 40 patients are needed in each group to detect a clinically relevant reduction of bis after induction of anesthesia by 30% with a power of 0.80 and level of significance of 5% . to assess differences in patients characteristics between the two groups , two independent samples t - tests for normally distributed responses and mann - whitney tests for nonnormally distributed responses were carried out . overall group differences in all variables were assessed by using repeated measures anova . a paired samples t - test or a mann - whitney test was used to assess differences at each time point wherever appropriate . all analyses were performed using the statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) software , version 11.0 ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) . in the operating room a peripheral vein was catheterized and a ringer 's solution infusion was started . monitoring consisted of pulse oximetry , electrocardiogram , heart rate , noninvasive arterial pressure , end - tidal carbon dioxide ( etco2 ) , inspired and end - tidal sevoflurane concentrations , tidal volume and respiratory rate ( s/5 anesthesia monnitor , datex - ohmeda division , datex - ohmeda , helsinki , finland ) and bispectral index ( bis xp a-2000 monitor , system rev 3.21 , aspect medical systems , leiden , the netherlands ) . according to the group allocation , in the preinduction period patients were fully awake , breathing spontaneously either 50% n2o in oxygen ( fio2 = 0.5 ) or air ( fio2 = 0.21 ) for 10 min via a mapleson c breathing system and a tightly fitting face mask . the anesthetic circuit was primed with 8% sevoflurane : an oxygen flow 6 l / min was allowed to pass through the circle anesthetic system with the sevoflurane vaporizer dial being set at 8% for 5 min . an endotracheal tube was attached to the end of the anesthetic system with the distal end tightly surrounded by a plastic bag . after the completion of the 10 min administration of the n2o / oxygen or air , the face mask was connected to the sevoflurane primed anesthetic circuit and all patients were allowed to breathe spontaneously sevoflurane in oxygen with the sevoflurane vaporizer set at 8% and an oxygen flow rate 6 l / min . after a 5 min period of sevoflurane inhalation , the study protocol and data collection were completed . a short acting opioid was given iv and a supraglottic airway device was inserted for the ventilation of patients during surgery . during the 10 min preinduction period , bis , respiratory rate , tidal volume , etco2 , heart rate and oxygen saturation ( spo2 ) were recorded every minute . the same parameters were recorded every 30 s during the first 5 min induction period with the patient breathing sevoflurane in oxygen . during the induction period inspired and end -

tidal sevoflurane concentration did not differ significantly between the two groups during the first 300 s of sevoflurane inhalation [ table 3 ] . bis , etco2 , vt , rr , spo2 , hr and fi and fe sevoflurane concentrations in the n2o- and air - breathing groups during induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane bispectral index values ( mean  standard deviation ) during inhalation with sevoflurane in the nitrous oxide and air groups the results of the present study suggest that pretreatment with n2o in 50% oxygen for 10 min before inhalation induction with sevoflurane enhances induction as assessed by decreased bis values . these results are not consistent with other studies when n2o was administered concomitantly with sevoflurane for inhalation induction . nevertheless , these studies were based on clinical criteria , which are subjective and therefore more difficult to be quantified . found that the addition of 50% n2o to the sevoflurane / oxygen mixture had no effect on the speed of induction and was associated with more excitatory effects . the investigators defined induction time as the time needed for the raised arm to fall to the horizontal level . also , according to siau and liu , 66% n2o added to oxygen did not decrease the induction time with 8% sevoflurane when compared to the induction time of 8% sevoflurane in oxygen alone . these investigators administered higher concentrations of n2o than those administered in the present study but did not prime the circle breathing circuit with sevoflurane . in a previous study , we have shown that pretreatment with 100% oxygen enhances the inhalation induction with 7% sevoflurane as assessed by bis monitoring . replacing nitrogen in the lungs with a more soluble gas like oxygen , results in lung collapse , decreased functional residual capacity and increased alveolar concentration of the inhaled anesthetic , that is , sevoflurane . in contrast to oxygen , in the present study the n2o was discontinued during induction . it is worthy to note that during induction , the end - tidal ( fe ) sevoflurane concentration ( though no statistically significant ) was higher during the first 120 s. the higher fe is consistent with increased ventilation in the n2o group , as indicated by the higher respiratory rates and the lower co2 values . , oxygen is also expected to enhance the sevoflurane uptake and to diminish the difference between the n2o and air groups as it is more soluble than nitrogen and part of the lungs will collapse to some extent ( absorption atelectasis ) . similarly , n2o - being 32 times more soluble than nitrogen - is rapidly up taken by the blood , resulting in lung contraction and increased alveolar concentration of sevoflurane . however , eventually alveolar collapsing will be associated with pulmonary shunt which will delay sevoflurane uptake . the time points at which bis values differ significantly in the present study are between 60 and 150 s. the inspired and expired sevoflurane concentrations did not differ between the n2o and the air groups during the 300 s period of induction , though the end - tidal / inspired concentration ( f 
 e / fi ) ratio for sevoflurane was consistently higher by 2 - 7% in the n2o group . sevoflurane due to its low blood gas partition coefficient might not benefit from the second gas effect phenomenon . however taheri and eger have nicely demonstrated the second gas effect for desflurane , an agent even less blood soluble . demonstrated a higher ratio of alveolar / inspired ( f 
 a / fi ) sevoflurane concentration when n2o was added to the inspired mixture . peyton et al . reported a two to three times more powerful second gas effect of n2o on arterial versus the end - expired sevoflurane pressures and attributed this effect to ventilation perfusion inhomogeneity by general anesthesia . in both studies , our data were collected with the patients breathing spontaneously and receiving solely sevoflurane without other anesthetics or adjuvants . pretreatment with n2o may not ensure an overall faster inhalation induction , but highlights the failure of previous studies to demonstrate enhancement of sevoflurane induction by concomitant n2o administration . previous studies failed to show a more rapid induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane for various reasons . as sevoflurane is an agent with low solubility , it may not benefit the very first minutes of induction by the concomitant administration of n2o . so we remain with our hypothesis that this difference between the n2o and air groups may be attributed to the pretreatment rather than the co - administration of n2o during sevoflurane induction of anesthesia . a very early increased concentration effect due to volume reduction and before the  shunt  effect , as n2o is taken up by the pulmonary capillaries or increased ventilation , as shown by the lower etco2 , in the n2o group may have influenced the speed of the sevoflurane uptake . in clinical practice , fast inhalational induction may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals ; it may shorten the second stage of anesthesia , thus reducing the risk of agitation / adverse respiratory events , and increase patient 's satisfaction , while - depending on the time saved - it may also decrease the overall operating room time and facilitate fast turnover . our measurements are limited by the sensitivity of the device we used to measure sevoflurane and n2o , thus the infrared analyzer , as the gold standard to measure concentrations of inhaled anesthetics is the gas chromatography or the mass spectrometry . other limitations of the study are the number of dropouts , which may have an impact on the study power and the relatively long period of n2o pretreatment which weakens the clinical implementation of our results and shorter pretreatment periods like 2 or 3 min may be clinically applicable . under the present study design , breathing of 50% n2o in oxygen before induction with sevoflurane enhances the speed of induction in the very early period as assessed by the bis monitor .","background and aims : inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane may be enhanced by several drugs or techniques . 
 the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of nitrous oxide ( n2o ) pretreatment on the speed of anesthesia induction with sevoflurane.material and methods : eighty patients scheduled for hysteroscopy under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to inhale for 10 min before induction 50% n2o in oxygen or air via a facemask . 
 anesthesia was induced with 7 - 8% sevoflurane in oxygen via a facemask . 
 bispectral index ( bis ) , end - tidal carbon dioxide ( etco2 ) tidal volume , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation ( spo2 ) , and heart rate were recorded every minute during the 10 min pretreatment periods and every 30 s during the first 300 s of induction with sevoflurane . during induction of anesthesia inspired and end - tidal sevoflurane concentrations were also recorded.results:during the 10 min of inspired 50% n2o or air bis , etco2 , tidal volume , respiratory rate and heart rate values did not differ between the two groups except for the spo2 , which was higher in the n2o group ( p < 0.001 ) . during induction of anesthesia 
 the n2o group exhibited lower bis values ( p = 0.001 ) , being significant at 60 - 150 s ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 , p = 0.002 , p = 0.014 ) as well as at 270 s ( p = 0.004 ) . 
 etco2 and tidal volume were consistently lower in the n2o group ( p = 0.001 , p = 0.041 respectively ) and respiratory rate was higher ( p = 0.007).conclusion : our results show that pretreatment of the patients with 50% n2o for 10 min enhances the speed of induction with sevoflurane as assessed by the bis monitoring .",430
"since 2006 , surveillance physicians have listed and collected blood from those patients encephalitis , defined as fever or history of fever with axillary temperature > 38.5c ( 101.3f ) and altered mental status , new onset of seizures , or new neurologic deficit  in patients admitted to 3 nipah surveillance hospitals : rajshahi , rangpur , and faridpur medical college hospitals . the institute for epidemiology disease control and research and us centers for disease control and prevention tested serum with an igm - capture enzyme immunoassay to detect niv igm , and we defined laboratory - confirmed niv encephalitis as niv igm in serum . during december 2012march 2013 , surveillance physicians interviewed accompanying caregivers of all hospitalized patients whose illness met the encephalitis case definition on admission in the inpatient ward . study physicians asked about patients consumption of raw or fermented date palm sap and contact with other persons with fever and altered mental status in the month before illness onset ; if caregivers were unaware of the patient s exposures , study physicians asked them phone the patient s friends and colleagues about exposures . hospital physicians used personal protection equipment and provided it to caregivers of each patient with encephalitis and a history of these exposures . as part of subsequent epidemiologic studies , we also conducted detailed case investigations at each niv encephalitis case - patient s household . we interviewed surviving patients directly , or appropriate proxies among family , friends and relatives for patients who died , about their exposures to encephalitis patients or to fresh or fermented date palm sap before illness . we calculated the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , and negative predictive value ( npv ) of the screening questions asked on admissions to hospitals by comparing with the niv igm results . we repeated the calculations for patients hospitalized during january and february , when the prevalence of niv encephalitis is highest . we compared the answers provided by caregivers during patient hospitalization with those provided during interviews in the community as part of our epidemiologic studies . icddr , b s ethical review committee reviewed and approved the protocol for niv surveillance and case investigation . they collected and tested blood samples from 328 ( 91% ) patients for niv igm . seventeen ( 5% ) had niv igm ( table 1 ) , of whom 15 ( 88% ) niv encephalitis case - patients were identified during january and february 2013 . of the 17 confirmed case - patients , family caregivers of 14 reported either a history of drinking raw or fermented date palm sap or contact with other persons with fever and altered mental status in the month before illness onset . therefore , the sensitivity of the screening questions was 82% , specificity was 86% , ppv was 24% and npv was 99% ( table 2 ) . the sensitivity during january  february was 93% , specificity was 82% , ppv was 37% , and npv was 99% . * drinking raw or fermented date palm sap or having contact with encephalitis patients in month before illness onset . at admission , 3 ( 18% ) niv encephalitis case - patients had no reported history of drinking raw or fermented date palm sap or of contact with persons who had encephalitis ( table 1 ) . however , during the epidemiologic investigations in the community , family members of 2 case - patients reported that the patients drank fermented date palm sap in the month before illness onset . of the 14 niv encephalitis case - patients who , at admission , had reported 1 of the risk exposures , results were consistent with exposures reported during the epidemiologic investigation . screening patients with possible encephalitis at the time they seek hospital care regarding recent exposure to date palm sap and to other patients with encephalitis demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting niv encephalitis , particularly during peak months of niv encephalitis incidence . the high npv of the screening questions suggests that focusing infection control efforts toward patients with these exposures is an efficient use of scarce resources to prevent transmission . although three fourths of encephalitis patients had reported histories of exposure , they possibly could have had other infections , including other bat - borne viruses , that were transmitted through similar routes or could have lacked niv igm , despite having niv infection ( 13 ) . alternatively , recent consumption of date palm sap by these patients might have been purely coincidental because this practice is common in bangladesh during this season , but nipah infection is rare . for 2 niv encephalitis case - patients , caregivers did not report a history of drinking fermented date palm sap during hospital interview , but this behavior was reported in later community investigations . because 90% of bangladeshis are muslim , and consumption of alcohol is prohibited by islam ( 14 ) and illegal in bangladesh , patients might be reluctant to report drinking traditional liquor made of fermented date palm sap . therefore , caregivers should be asked about socially stigmatized behaviors privately and confidentially to increase the odds that these stigmatized behaviors are reported . exposure - based screening can detect patients at high risk for niv encephalitis in low - income , resource - constrained settings , such as bangladesh . we deployed screening questions on admission to inpatient wards but screening earlier , at triage in emergency wards , could further reduce risk . surveillance for other diseases with well - described exposures that put healthcare workers at risk , such as ebola virus infection , and where laboratory diagnosis is limited or delayed could also deploy this approach .","we measured the performance of exposure screening questions to identify nipah virus encephalitis in hospitalized encephalitis patients during the 201213 nipah virus season in bangladesh . the sensitivity ( 93% ) , 
 specificity ( 82% ) , positive predictive value ( 37% ) , and negative predictive value ( 99% ) results suggested that screening questions could more quickly identify persons with nipah virus encephalitis .",87
"a 3-year - old girl was admitted to our hospital with unexplained fever and paroxysmal abdominal pain that had persisted for three days . her body temperature at the time of admission was 39.5. physical examination showed abdominal tension , though there was no obvious tenderness and rebound tenderness . the blood platelets count ( 24010/l ) was normal , and the c - reactive protein ( > 1.6 mg / dl ) , the white blood cell count ( 13.910/l ) and eosinophil count ( 4% , 0.5810/l ) were elevated , while hepatic glutamic oxalacetic transaminase ( 24 u / l ) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( 21 u / l ) were normal . however , the level of cholinesterase ( 2,395 the abdominal non - contrast ct obtained on the fifth hospital day revealed diffusely hypodense nodular lesions in the hepatic parenchyma with marked hepatomegaly , retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and ascites in the pelvic cavity . eight days after admission , an abdominal mri revealed marked hepatomegaly with diffuse high intensity of the homogeneous nodular lesions ( 2 - 4 mm diameter ) throughout the hepatic parenchyma and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy . in addition , disseminated miliary nodules of high signal intensity were located on the peritoneum on the t2-weighted images , as well as a group of diffuse , low intensity nodular lesions were seen throughout the hepatic parenchyma on the axial t1-weighted images ( fig . , a chest ct showed multiple small hyperdense nodules ( 2 - 4 mm in diameter ) in both lungs ( fig . after the small intestinal wall and peritoneal biopsy , histological examination revealed parenchymal tubercles containing several larvae of pentastomids and a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration surrounding them ( fig . at this point , it was revealed by the patient 's parents that the patient had consumed snake meat several months prior to her admission . following the diagnosis , she was administered praziquantel ( 0.5 g , tid , per day ) and albendazole ( 0.75 g , bid , per day ) in order to expel the intestinal worms . the patient 's temperature began to slowly decrease two days after the start of the therapy , and after 10 days of the therapy the fever had disappeared and the abdominal pain was diminished . on examination , pentastomid worms were observed in a stool ( fig . the patient made an uneventful recovery after a half a month of therapy and she was discharged from our hospital . human pentastomiasis is divided into two types : the more common visceral pentastomiasis ( which is the main portion of the cases of pentastomiasis ) and nasopharyngeal pentastomiasis ( 1 ) . visceral pentastomiasis is an unusual parasitic zoonosis that is caused by the larval stages ( nymphs ) of several species of pentastomes ( ' tongue worms ' ) , and these are parasites that form a unique phylum with characteristics of both arthropods and annelids ( 2 ) . at present , there are ten known pathogenic species of pentastomid parasites and six known kinds of human pentastomiasis . the latter include armilliferosis , linguatulosis , porocephalosis , raillietiellosis , leiperiosis and sebekiosis ( 3 ) . the species that affect humans belong to the families linguatulidae , armilliferidae and porocephalidae , and all of which have different geographic distributions . more than 90% of the human cases are caused by the nymphs of only two species , l. serrata and a. armillatus ( 4 ) . the infection develops in humans when parasite ova are ingested from the respiratory secretions or feces from the final hosts ( dogs and other carnivores for linguatula , several species of large snakes for armillifer and porocephalus ) . in the digestive tract of the human host , the minute four - legged primary larvae hatch and invade the viscera of the digestive tract in the human host ( 5 , 6 ) . the nymphs involve many organs , including the liver , esophagus , stomach , duodenum , jejunum , ileum , colon , appendix , rectum , mesentery , gallbladder , lung , pleura , broad ligament , pancreas , omentum , bladder , adrenal gland , heart ( pericardium ) , lymph nodes , skin , epididymis , eye , brain , inguinal hernia sac , etc ; however , the liver is the most common site ( 7 ) . visceral pentastomiasis causes the majority of asymptomatic infections in humans , but a small number of cases are fatal , and the severity of symptoms is related to the organs that are infected and the degree of infection by the nymph ( 8) . the patients with a heavy infestation showed chronic fever , ascites , abdominal pain , diarrhea , mild anemia , hepatosplenomegaly , eosinophilia in the bone marrow and blood , and multiple polyps in the whole colon . the pathologic features of the liver biopsy are degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes , along with obvious infiltration of eosinophils . as was demonstrated in this study , praziquantel or mebendazole is a medical treatment for this disease ( 9 ) . only a few cases of pentastomiasis infections have been reported in humans around the world , and there is limited literature about the imaging features of pentastomiasis infection . we report here a case where the patient had a history of eating snake meat several months prior to her hospital admission , and her main symptoms were a high fever and abdominal pain . an abdominal mri demonstrated diffuse nodules throughout the liver , an enlarged liver , a little ascites , diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and disseminated miliary nodules of high signal intensity on the peritoneum . the laparoscopy revealed that the liver was diffusely enlarged , as well as there were diffusely scattered micro - cyst nodules of varying sizes on the surface of the liver and the peritoneum . microscopically , the small intestinal wall and peritoneal biopsy showed several larvae of pentastomids in the cyst nodules . the parasite worms were surrounded by a group of macrophages , inflammatory cells and fibrosis . when liver enlargement and diffuse hepatic hypodense nodular lesion is seen on a t1-weighted image , it is necessary to differentiate pentastomiasis hepatic involvement from other diseases that present with diffuse liver enlargement , high fever and abdominal pain ( 10 , 11 ) such as diffuse liver metastasis , diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma , lymphoma and diffuse granulomatosis ( 12 ) . biopsy or autopsy is necessary to determine the cause of the symptoms . in this report we studied the patient with magnetic resonance imaging . due to the spatial resolution of the current t2-weighted mr imagers , the detection of these microcysts and larvae within the microcysts was well accomplished in tandem with the clinical features and epidemiology , which aided in making the differential diagnosis ( 13 ) . in summary , we have presented a rare case of pentastomiasis infection that involved many organs , including the liver , small intestine , peritoneum , lung and retroperitoneal lymph nodes . the patient 's symptoms consisted of high fever , abdominal pain , abdominal tension and anemia . the imaging features of the abdominal mri revealed marked hepatomegaly with diffuse homogeneous nodular lesions throughout the hepatic parenchyma , diffuse retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and disseminated miliary nodules on the peritoneum . the chest ct showed scattered small nodules in both lungs . when liver enlargement and hepatic disseminated miliary nodules are identified , it is necessary to differentiate pentastomiasis hepatic involvement from other diseases . pentastomiasis infections should be considered in the diagnoses of patients with a history of such abdominal symptoms and who have consumed snake meat , though the definite diagnosis depends on the pathology report .","we report here a case of pentastomiasis infection in a 3-year - old girl who had high fever , abdominal pain , abdominal tension and anemia . 
 ultrasound scanning of the abdomen revealed disseminated hyperechoic nodules in the liver and a small amount of ascites . 
 abdominal mri showed marked hepatomegaly with disseminated miliary nodules of high signal intensity throughout the hepatic parenchyma on t2-weighted images ; retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and disseminated miliary nodules on the peritoneum were also noted . 
 chest ct showed scattered small hyperdense nodules on both sides of the lungs . 
 the laparoscopy demonstrated diffuse white nodules on the liver surface and the peritoneum . 
 after the small intestinal wall and peritoneal biopsy , histological examination revealed parenchymal tubercles containing several larvae of pentastomids and a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration around them . 
 the pathological diagnosis was parasitic granuloma from pentastomiasis infection .",210
"the bacterial agents of infectious keratitis that have been studied in considerable detail are three of the most common causes of such infections , namely , staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa . the mechanisms underlying the tissue damage occurring during these infections have been studied in animal models . these infections are initiated by injection of bacteria into the corneal stroma , usually of new zealand rabbits , or by the application of a topical drop of bacteria to a scarified cornea , usually of a mouse . important to this research is the relative virulence of three forms of a bacterial strain , namely , the unaltered parent strain , its mutant deficient in a single specific gene coding for a secreted protein , and that same mutant strain following insertion of a functional copy of the mutated gene , a rescued strain . if the parent and rescue strains have statistically equivalent virulence and the mutant has significantly less virulence , then the mutated gene is recognized as a key virulence factor for the cornea . an additional method for establishing a specific gene as a virulence factor is to demonstrate that insertion of this specific gene into a nonpathogenic strain can significantly increase the virulence . these types of genetic analysis of virulence have defined multiple virulence factors for each of the three organisms commonly causing keratitis . the importance of secreted proteins to keratitis can be illustrated by the study of certain nonpathogenic strains of bacteria . one observation that is not generally recognized , but is very important to consider , is that bacteria can be injected into a rabbit cornea and there grow from a small inoculum to millions of bacteria without causing any harm to the eye [ 4 , 5 ] . for instance , pseudomonas putida has been shown to grow well without mediating inflammation or corneal damage . this organism has lps and other surface molecules , but it does not secrete proteins with corneal toxicity . this harmless infection is unlike that seen in an infection with the same p. putida strain after it has been modified by the insertion of a plasmid bearing a single p. aeruginosa gene coding for a secreted protease known to be a corneal virulence factor . in fact , the secretion of any one of the three known p. aeruginosa proteases can result in a virulent infection . the value of knowing the mechanisms of bacterial corneal virulence relates to the need to limit such mechanisms before the tissue damage deprives the eye of vision . application of an antibiotic to an infected eye can eliminate the infecting bacteria , but the damaging bacterial proteins already secreted can continue to mediate harmful inflammation and act directly to damage the cornea . the inclusion of a steroid during antibiotic therapy helps control the inflammatory process , but the actions of the secreted proteins are not affected by such therapy [ 7 , 8 ] . knowledge of the key mediators of tissue damage must be known to allow subsequent development of adjunct therapies to limit the action of these bacterial proteins . the prospect of using the immune system to inhibit these secreted bacterial proteins has a merit , but the bacterial enzymes found to be active in damaging corneal tissue may be poor immunogens or the antibody produced may not be effective in impeding the enzymatic activity . thus , the mechanisms of keratitis have partially evaded the benefit of our current therapies . also problematic is the emergence of bacteria with greater resistance to those antibiotics that were highly successful for many previous years ; delays in obtaining an effective therapy provides time for the bacterial population to expand and to continue secreting the damaging proteins . pseudomonas corneal infections typically are associated with the use of contact lenses ; that is , this is a man - made disease which was rarely a problem during the centuries prior to the contact lens use [ 1012 ] . the organism , seen as a single gram - negative rod , is found in the environment , especially in moist places , so it is often available to contaminate the contact lens cases . its adherence to plastic , coupled with its resistance to disinfectants , favors its introduction into the eye . these organisms can react with a corneal defect in the epithelium and they can pass through the epithelial barrier to the corneal stroma . once these organisms reach the corneal stroma , the infections can rapidly progress toward melting of the cornea , an event attributed to the bacterial proteases , the activation of matrix metalloproteinases , and a damaging immune response that delivers among other things both reactive oxygen intermediates and host proteases . p. aeruginosa is capable of secreting at least seven different proteases ; these are elastase a ( las a ) , elastase b ( las b ) , modified elastase , alkaline protease ( ap ) , protease iv , pseudomonas aeruginosa small protease ( pasp ) , and the large exoprotease ( lep a ) . las a , las b , modified elastase , and ap are metalloproteinases and may be produced by only some strains . these metalloproteases , especially las b and ap , have been well studied in terms of their potential contribution to keratitis . these enzymes , especially las b , upon injection into the corneal stroma can mediate considerable corneal damage [ 18 , 19 ] . however , mutation of any one of these genes does not result in significantly reduced virulence of the organism [ 2022 ] . also , data exist showing that a strain with the potential to produce las b fails to produce the enzyme during keratitis . p. putida , when supplied with a plasmid - borne gene for las b , secretes las b and demonstrates significant virulence in the infected rabbit cornea . lep a is a large protease that has been postulated to be a serine protease [ 16 , 24 ] . the enzyme has been shown to be a virulence factor in a nonocular model of infection , but to date there are no published studies of its role in an ocular infection . an important study on lep a showed that this enzyme can cleave a host transmembrane protein , designated the protease - activated receptor , which , when cleaved , can induce the production of cytokines . this study helps explain the inflammation that results when the bacteria producing proteases interact with corneal cells . this finding may also clarify the failure of p. putida to cause inflammatory changes as it grows in the cornea whereas the same stain engineered to produce a p. aeruginosa protease causes significant inflammation . in contrast to the findings with the metalloproteases , the serine protease piv is produced by essentially all strains able to cause keratitis [ 25 , 26 ] . mutation of the piv gene has been shown to reduce the corneal virulence and the corneal virulence was restored following the insertion into the mutant strain of a plasmid coding for functional piv . when a piv - coding plasmid was inserted into p. putida , the organism acquired a significant amount of corneal virulence . piv is able to cleave many proteins ; in fact , few proteins with lysine escape cleavage by this protease [ 27 , 28 ] . . cleaved by piv are a variety of host defense proteins including immunoglobulins , complement components , antimicrobial peptides , and surfactants [ 2729 ] . this protease contributes to virulence yet it is inefficient in cleaving collagens , the chief structural component of the corneal stroma . piv has a molecular weight of 27,384 daltons and it can aggregate following exposure to sds to enzymatically active masses of > 200,000 daltons [ 27 , 28 ] . extensive immunizations with recombinant piv were needed to produce even a relatively small amount of antibody to recombinant piv or native piv . the antibodies that were produced failed to inhibit the piv catalytic activity or to provide protection from corneal damage due to the injection of active enzyme . the enzyme activity is susceptible to tlck , a serine protease inhibitor , but unfortunately tlck is highly toxic for eyes . the development of a nontoxic inhibitor could be very useful as an adjunct therapy for treating these infections . the pasp protease has recently been analyzed relative to its role in keratitis and its properties as an enzyme [ 15 , 30 , 31 ] . the pasp gene is found in all strains tested and western blots of culture supernatants indicate that it is commonly expressed and secreted by both clinical isolates and established lab strains . a mutant lacking the pasp gene was engineered and found to have significantly less virulence than its parent or its rescued strain . the reduced virulence of the pasp - deficient mutant was demonstrated in both the rabbit intrastromal injection model and the mouse scratch model of keratitis . injection of purified pasp into the rabbit cornea results in the destruction of the epithelium and the formation of erosions that can reach into the stroma . pasp , like piv , is not neutralized by antibody to the recombinant pasp protein and the antibody does not protect the cornea from the injected enzyme or active infection . the native pasp protein as found in culture supernatants has a molecular weight of 18,500 daltons [ 15 , 30 ] . studies of the purified enzyme or its recombinant protein showed that , unlike piv , pasp does not efficiently cleave many host proteins [ 15 , 30 ] . however , pasp is able to cleave collagens and this trait further distinguishes pasp from piv . cleavage of collagen by pasp suggests that this enzyme could be important in the destruction of the cornea . pasp will cleave peptides with lysine or arginine and it can convert poly - l - arginine or poly - l - lysine to small peptides and free amino acids . pasp appears to be a serine protease that is susceptible to serine protease inhibitors ( e.g. , tlck ) and partially inhibited , in a non - dose - dependent fashion , by high concentrations of edta ( > 100  mm ) . enzymatic activity may require the formation of a homodimer in order to create the triad of three amino acids that form the active catalytic site . the possibility exists that piv provides the bacteria with a defense against multiple host defense molecules whereas pasp is active in cleaving the collagen - based structure of the cornea . once a sizeable population of p. aeruginosa is established in a tissue site , a great deal of host response and tissue damage occurs before the infection is cleared . recent attention has been given to s. pneumoniae ( pneumococcus ) as a major cause of conjunctivitis outbreaks ; however , this organism is also a common cause of infectious keratitis . some epidemiologic studies identify the pneumococcus as the top cause of bacterial keratitis [ 3239 ] . most other reports show this bacterium and other streptococcus species to be the causative agents most commonly encountered after p. aeruginosa and/or s. aureus [ 4049 ] . pneumococcal keratitis is not typically contact lens associated like p. aeruginosa , but predisposing conditions such as ocular trauma or surgery are factors in this disease [ 32 , 33 , 36 , 39 , 41 , 48 , 5054 ] .   the outer capsule of s. pneumoniae , while not protein but rather polysaccharide in composition , is likely the single most studied virulence factor of this bacterium . pneumococcus normally resides in the human nasopharynx , and studies that date back to early bacterial virulence and transformation experiments such as those of griffith   and avery et al . determined that the polysaccharide capsule ( i.e. , the characteristic that provides a  smooth  colony appearance ) is the component necessary for s. pneumoniae to establish virulence and survive the host immune system . the central dogma of pneumococcal virulence in infections such as pneumonia , otitis media , meningitis , and septicemia is that noncapsular bacteria are avirulent . this long held rule was proven to be untrue for keratitis , as noncapsular strains were shown to cause as severe keratitis as their capsular counterparts in intrastromal infection models [ 57 , 58 ] . other than the capsule , the pneumococcus possesses a variety of proteins that have been characterized as virulence factors in nonocular models of disease . one such protein is pneumolysin , which is a toxin belonging to the family of bacterial cholesterol - dependent cytolysins . pneumolysin is a 53  kda protein that does not possess any known secretion signal sequence . this cytolysin was long thought to be an intracellular protein released from the bacteria upon cell lysis [ 5961 ] and more recently reported to be cell wall associated . the mode of action of pneumolysin is the binding of monomers to cholesterol in host cell membranes , oligomerization at the membrane into 3050  mers , and pore formation resulting in host cell lysis [ 6365 ] . lower concentrations of pneumolysin have been reported to stimulate leukocyte migration   and activate complement , thus stimulating the host inflammatory response and causing immunomediated damage to host tissues . johnson and allen first identified pneumolysin as responsible for ocular tissue damage during pneumococcal keratitis and characterized the biochemical features in vitro and the role in corneal virulence in vivo [ 68 , 69 ] . pneumolysin was verified to play a major role in keratitis as evidenced by reduced corneal virulence of a pneumolysin - deficient strain of s. pneumoniae compared to its parent strain in a rabbit intrastromal infection model . mutation of the complement activation domain of pneumolysin also resulted in decreased corneal virulence , particularly inflammation . added to these findings was that induction of leukopenia in rabbits resulted in significantly decreased severity of corneal damage following challenge with purified pneumolysin , indicating that pneumolysin was at least partly responsible for triggering the inflammatory response and causing immunomediated damage . moreover , these and more recent studies have shown that pneumococcal keratitis continues to worsen in animal models when the bacteria have either reached a very low number or have been completely cleared [ 58 , 71 , 73 , 74 ] , underscoring the fact that corneal damage occurs despite eradication of the bacteria by antibiotics .   efforts to find feasible pneumolysin inhibitors for the cornea have led to the use of soluble cholesterol as a topical therapy . cholesterol was long known to be effective in inhibiting the hemolytic activity of pneumolysin in vitro , so this concept was employed in vivo . topical cholesterol was shown to significantly reduce corneal inflammation in pneumococcal keratitis , purportedly by acting as a competitor for host cholesterol and neutralizing pneumolysin [ 76 , 77 ] . another attempt at targeting pneumolysin was the use of active and passive immunization in an animal model of keratitis [ 73 , 78 ] . proteins other than pneumolysin have been shown to be important for virulence in nonocular pneumococcal diseases but have not been associated with keratitis to date . choline - binding proteins such as pneumococcal surface proteins a and c ( pspa and pspc ) are anchored by their bonds to choline in the cell wall . other proteins are those containing lpxtg motifs that are recognized by bacterial sortase enzymes and are placed on the cell surface . one pneumococcal lpxtg protein of interest is neuraminidase a ( nana ) , which cleaves n - acetylneuraminic acid from host cell components and is suggested to be important for the binding of pneumococci to conjunctival epithelial cells by degrading host cell mucin . a variety of surface - associated proteins that do not fall into the categories of choline - binding proteins or lpxtg proteins have also been identified as involved in adherence , immune evasion , immune activation , and enzymatic reactions in nonocular models . finally , at least four zinc metalloproteinases , including an iga protease , have been identified with conflicting reports of their cellular locations . one of these proteases , zmpc , has recently been shown to induce ectodomain shedding of a membrane - associated mucin from cultured conjunctival and corneal epithelial cells . much remains unknown , however , as to the factors other than pneumolysin that contribute to pneumococcal keratitis . s. aureus is the most common cause of bacterial keratitis and an important cause of other ocular infections [ 8287 ] . this gram - positive coccus is found in human carriers who retain the organism in their anterior nares , throat , and perianal body sites . specific strains of bacteria found in the flora around the eye provide the source of organisms that infect the eye . humans are one reservoir for this organism , and multiple animals , especially pigs , have had an important role in the epidemiology of s. aureus . keratitis occurs in individuals whose eyes are compromised by any of multiple changes including ocular surgery , contact lens use , trauma , viral infection , or other illnesses [ 9193 ] . s. aureus is well known for its ability to evolve mechanisms of antibiotic resistance , making these infections among the most difficult to treat , and antibiotic resistance has increased since 2000 [ 9497 ] . although the antibiotic resistance of s. aureus is well known , what is less well recognized is that the gene transfer mechanisms that created the highly resistant strains can also transfer virulence traits [ 98100 ] . bacteriophage provides horizontal transfer of individual genes as well as clusters of virulence traits in a genetic unit designated as a pathogenicity island . individual strains can develop a set of genes that allow their emergence as a cause of life - threatening infections . s. aureus has been shown to bind to human corneal cells in culture , a reaction mediated by the fibronectin - binding protein on the bacterial surface . binding to the cornea can also be mediated by a collagen - binding adhesin on the s. aureus surface . despite this binding ability and the availability of organisms from the flora surrounding the eye , keratitis infrequently develops . possibly the greatest barrier protecting the eye is the bactericidal enzyme phospholipase a2 , a component of the tear film [ 103 , 104 ] . once inflammation occurs in the anterior portion of the eye , the amount of phospholipase a2 increases , thus enhancing protection against bacteria . the topical application of s. aureus to a scarified rabbit cornea typically fails to cause an infection and results in the rapid loss of the bacteria . an active infection of the rabbit cornea has been achieved by treating a bacterial inoculum on a contact lens with spermidine and applying spermidine to the eye both before and after applying the contaminated lens to the corneal surface . spermidine is able to bind to the bacterial surface and prevent bacterial killing by phospholipase a2 . there is , however , one unique strain of s. aureus that can infect the scarified cornea without any other treatments ; this strain is susceptible to the bactericidal action of tears but has demonstrated an enhanced invasion of human corneal epithelial cells in vitro [ unpublished finding ] . these data suggest that keratitis is dependent on bacterial binding and rapid penetration of the corneal epithelium . the events occurring once bacteria reach the corneal stroma have been studied in some detail . the virulence of a prototype s. aureus strain ( 8325 - 4 ) following its injection into the rabbit cornea was significantly reduced by a mutation of the gene coding for alpha - toxin , a lytic cytotoxin produced by nearly all s. aureus strains . the alpha - toxin rescue strain had corneal virulence equivalent to that of the parent strain . nanogram quantities of purified alpha - toxin were shown to cause extensive sloughing of the corneal epithelium , corneal edema , and severe iritis . the importance of this toxin was found also in the infection of the mouse cornea [ 108 , 109 ] . alpha - toxin is now recognized as the critical virulence factor in s. aureus pneumonia in humans . research on the alpha - toxin 's mechanism of action indicates that the toxin enters the cytoplasmic membrane and moves laterally until seven subunits unite into a circular arrangement forming a pore in the cytoplasmic membrane . the individual toxin molecules are thought to interact with caveolin-1 in the membrane to form a pore [ 111113 ] . inhibitors of the alpha - toxin - mediated lysis of erythrocytes have been developed by inserting lipid molecules into a cyclodextrin ring [ 114 , 115 ] . one such inhibitor containing cholesterol has been shown to reduce the virulence of infections of the rabbit cornea . as was described above , the cyclodextrin - based inhibitor active against alpha - toxin is also active against pneumolysin . alpha - toxin is not the only virulence factor contributing to the tissue damage during s. aureus keratitis ; important also is gamma - toxin , a two - component toxin produced by nearly all s. aureus strains [ 116 , 117 ] . deletion of the gamma - toxin genes from a prototype strain , strain newman , resulted in a significant loss in corneal virulence and restoration of these genes enhanced the virulence back to that produced by the parent strain . a mutation in gamma - toxin or inhibition of this toxin has also been shown to reduce the virulence of endophthalmitis caused by s. aureus [ 119 , 120 ] . gamma - toxin is composed of an f component and an s component that are each nontoxic when tested alone [ 121 , 122 ] . the s component is thought to bind to the target cell and only then will the f component bind . the combination of f and s can move laterally in the cell membrane and multiple f - s pairs can combine into a ring that penetrates the membrane causing cell lysis [ 122124 ] . a cyclodextrin - based inhibitor for the gamma - toxin has very recently been identified as an inhibitor of the gamma - toxin - mediated lysis of erythrocytes , but it has not been tested yet in infected corneas . gamma - toxin is only one of several two - component toxins produced by s. aureus and each has its own f and s components . gamma - toxin is composed of two proteins , either hlga and hlgb or hlgc and hlgb ; likewise the panton - valentine leucocidin ( pvl ) , a well - recognized toxin , is composed of its two proteins , lukf - pv and luks - pv . lesser known proteins involved in toxic activity include three s - type proteins lukm , luks - r , and luk e and two f - type proteins lukf - r and luk d [ 122124 ] . there is about 6070% sequence homology among the various f components and a fairly similar degree of homology among the multiple s components . the two - component toxin systems of s. aureus are complicated by the fact that the f component of one toxin can bind to the s component of another toxin . therefore , multiple unique toxins can be formed by one component from each of two different toxins ( e.g. , the f of one toxin with the s of another toxin ) . each combination of an f and an s component can have its own specific toxicity . how these toxins relate to corneal damage is yet to be resolved , but because these toxins are homologous with gamma - toxin , it is likely that at least one such toxin has corneal toxicity . another molecule with proven ability to serve as a corneal virulence factor is the setnm-1 gene . this gene is a part of a cluster of genes for super - antigen - like proteins involved in virulence for infections in nonocular sites . these genes are found in a pathogenicity island on the chromosome of many s. aureus isolates and they are thought to have been derived from a phage genome . the genes in this island , other than setnm-1 , are known to inhibit host immune mediators such as complement or iga . only setnm-1 has been shown to mediate corneal damage ; that is , a mutant deficient in this gene has significantly reduced corneal virulence as compared to its parent and rescued strains . it is not yet clear how setnm-1 functions as a virulence factor , but one possibility is that it has protease activity . injection of the protein produced by the setnm-1 gene can cause extensive corneal damage , an event not expected for a super - antigen - like protein . the fundamental treatment of bacterial keratitis is based on the action of bactericidal antibiotic therapy to eliminate the bacteria that secrete the toxic proteins . a key issue in treatment is that the cornea has rapidly replicating bacteria prior to the onset of severe symptoms , and later , when symptoms are present , bacteria with a much reduced rate of bacterial replication predominate . key drugs , such as fluoroquinolones , are far more effective on replicating than nonreplicating bacteria , so the treatment of the cornea needs to be prompt , aggressive , and prolonged . global regulation of gene expression in bacteria limits the production of important toxins and enzymes until the bacteria are no longer rapidly replicating . once replication slows or stops , the toxins are secreted ; thus , nonreplicating bacteria are hard to kill and they are efficient toxin producers . the points to be stressed are that prompt bactericidal therapy is a must and that the toxins once produced can not now be eliminated without a loss of healthy tissue .","ocular bacterial infections are universally treated with antibiotics , which can eliminate the organism but can not reverse the damage caused by bacterial products already present . 
 the three very common causes of bacterial keratitis  pseudomonas aeruginosa , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus pneumoniae  all produce proteins that directly or indirectly cause damage to the cornea that can result in reduced vision despite antibiotic treatment . 
 most , but not all , of these proteins are secreted toxins and enzymes that mediate host cell death , degradation of stromal collagen , cleavage of host cell surface molecules , or induction of a damaging inflammatory response . studies of these bacterial pathogens have determined the proteins of interest that could be targets for future therapeutic options for decreasing corneal damage .",150
"a girl weighing 3,190 g was delivered by a caesarean section at 38 weeks and five days of gestation . at the time of birth , a systolic murmur was noted during a physical examination , and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a peri - membranous ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) with a septal aneurysm , a small patent foramen ovale ( pfo ) , and a small right - sided patent ductus arteriosus ( pda ) from the innominate artery . the vsd was measured as having a diameter of 3.5 mm and a shunt flow less than 2.5 m / sec . due to the presence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia , echoencephalography was conducted , and no abnormalities were found . five months later , the patient was referred to konkuk university medical center for vsd and pda . her body weight was 6,700 g ( 25th percentile ) , and her height was 61.6 cm ( 10th percentile ) . transthoracic echocardiography revealed a vsd approximately 6 mm in size with a minimal aneurysm , a left - sided pda 3.6 mm in diameter from the right aortic arch and an aberrant left subclavian artery . a subsequent computed tomographic scan demonstrated isolation of the left subclavian artery with a right aortic arch , a left pda , and a vsd ( fig . the intraoperative findings were a perimembranous vsd , a pfo , a mildly patent right ductus arteriosus , and isolation of the left subclavian artery connected to the left pulmonary artery via a left pda . the left subclavian artery was disconnected from the left pulmonary artery and reimplanted to the left common carotid artery by end - to - side anastomosis with monofilament polypropylene 6 - 0 sutures ( fig . ductus arteriosus is usually located on the left side , between the descending aorta and the junction of the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery . however , ductus arteriosus may also be present on the right side or , very rarely , may occur bilaterally in association with aortic arch anomalies or conotruncal anomalies . in such aortic arch anomalies , isolation of the left subclavian artery with right aortic arch is also uncommon . here , isolation refers to the fact that the left subclavian artery connects to the pulmonary artery via either the ligamentum arteriosum or a patent ductus arteriosus without any connection to the aorta . isolation of the left subclavian artery with a right aortic arch is known to be commonly associated with congenital heart disease , but may also occur with normal intracardiac anatomy , although few such cases have been described . isolation of the left subclavian artery with a right aortic arch may be related to the 22q11 deletion . bilateral ductus arteriosus and isolation of the left subclavian artery with a right aortic arch can be explained through the hypothetical double aortic arch plan suggested by edward . regression takes place on two levels in the double aortic arch plan : on one level , regression occurs between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery ; and on the other level , regression occurs at the left dorsal aortic root distal to the left ductus arteriosus . and then right ductus arteriosus remains persistent , left ductus arteriosus connects the left subclavian artery to the left pulmonary artery ( fig . however , the right ductus arteriosus regressed , and only the left ductus arteriosus remained patent . if the left ductus arteriosus is patent , blood may be supplied to the left subclavian artery via the left ductus arteriosus . if the left ductus arteriosus regresses , the blood supply to the left subclavian artery may involve a mediastinal , thoracic anastomosis , or vertebral pathway . isolation of the left subclavian artery usually presents with no apparent symptoms in neonates , but it may present with congenital pulmonary steal syndrome , subclavian steal syndrome , or may even present in adults with late symptoms due to sporadic progression . hayabuchi et al .   reported the case of a three - month - old girl with cerebral atrophy and an underdeveloped left arm . reported the case of a 15-year - old boy with an underdeveloped left arm . due to these symptoms and signs , the therapeutic management of isolation of the left subclavian artery remains controversial , especially when it is associated with complicated congenital heart disease . some authors have suggested that adequate collateral circulation must be ensured , meaning that reconstruction of the isolated subclavian artery is optional , regardless of the symptoms and signs . successful results have been reported after ligation or device closure of the pda and ligation of the left subclavian artery . however , reconstruction of the left subclavian artery due to pulmonary steal syndrome after right pda closure in bilateral pda has been reported . in one report , ischemic symptoms in the left arm and vertebrobasilar insufficiency occurred years after ligation of the left subclavian artery . hokari et al .   reported that a man with peutz - jeghers syndrome presented with his first vertigo attacks due to subclavian steal syndrome at 29 years of age . our patient presented with no symptoms and signs related to subclavian or pulmonary steal syndrome , and had shown normal findings on an echoencephalography study conducted at our medical center due to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia . however , brain computed tomography angiography performed after surgery revealed hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery . we suggest that this hypoplasia would have led to vertebrobasilar insufficiency or underdevelopment of the left arm without surgical reconstruction . since surgical reconstruction of the isolated left subclavian artery leads to antegrade flow in the left subclavian artery , it can prevent hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery and subclavian / pulmonary steal syndrome . our case shows that early surgical reconstruction is reasonable , regardless of the symptoms , in cases of isolation of the left subclavian artery .","right aortic arch with isolation of the left subclavian artery is a rare anomaly . 
 the incidence of bilateral ductus arteriosus is sporadic , and a right aortic arch with isolation of the left subclavian artery in association with bilateral ductus arteriosus is therefore extremely rare . 
 since the symptoms and signs of isolation of the left subclavian artery can include the absence or underdevelopment of the left arm , subclavian steal syndrome , or pulmonary artery steal syndrome , the proper therapeutic approach is controversial . 
 we report a case in which surgical reconstruction was used to treat isolation of the left subclavian artery with right aortic arch in association with bilateral ductus arteriosus and a ventricular septal defect .",149
"mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis ( mtle - hs ) is the most common type of partial or localization - related seizure disorder in humans . mesial temporal sclerosis ( mts ) with prominent neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus is the most common pathology in temporal lobe epilepsy ( tle ) . although the pathogenesis and epileptogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis ( hs ) has been studied for years , the information available so far still does not fully explain the situation . patients with mtle - hs usually have a history of febrile seizures , status epilepticus , trauma or , in some cases , a mixture of all these symptoms . recently , some studies have implicated inflammatory mechanisms that contribute or predispose to the occurrence of seizures in mtle - hs . cytokines such as interleukins ( il ) are involved in inflammation , immune activation , cell differentiation and apoptosis . in seizures , there is increasing evidence to support the role of il-1 in reducing seizure threshold and epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine status epilepticus model of epilepsy . found a strong association between the homozygotes for allele t at position -511 of the il-1 gene promoter region ( il-1-511 t / t ) and genetic predisposition to the development of hs in japanese tle patients . stated that increased il-1-511 t - allele frequency proved to be a potent determinant of prolonged febrile seizure , thus a discrepancy in prolonged febrile seizure incidence could explain recent conflicting results . three polymorphisms within the il-1 gene promoter region located at positions -1470 , -511 and -31 basepairs from the transcription start site were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium . additionally , when analyzed in combination , interestingly , however , these two publications have conflicting results in terms of transcriptional activity of il-1 promoter . while chen et al . concluded that the il-1-511 t allele was associated with higher il-1 promoter activity , wen et al . demonstrated that haplotype combinations carrying -511 c allele cause higher levels of secretion of il-1 from the lipopolysaccharide ( lps)-stimulated lymphocytes . in both of these studies , therefore , we intended to analyze the effect of -511 c / t polymorphism on il - i secretion from lps - induced lymphocytes in an attempt to reveal the possible role of this particular polymorhism in the etiopathogenesis of mtle - hs . thirty patients with mtle - hs admitted to the akdeniz university hospital neurology department , turkey , were enrolled in this study . a control group of 32 healthy volunteers with matching age , gender ratio and ethnic origins was also included . diagnosis of mtlehs was based on clinical history , electroencephalography , magnetic resonance imaging , and , in some patients , on histopathological findings after the selective amgydalahippocampectomy and anterior temporal lobectomy . the control subjects had no history of seizures or neurological disorders and no central nervous system or other infections at the time of blood sample collection . peripheral venous blood samples ( 3 ml ) were collected from each subject into vacutainer tubes containing edta . dna was extracted from blood samples using the robotic system magnapure ( roche ) and the amount of dna was measured by spectrophotometer . the -511 region of il-1 gene has been genotyped with polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( pcr - rflp ) using 2 mg of genomic dna as template . by using the primers for -511 c / t polymorphism described below , a 304 bp of dna region was amplified by pcr ( total 35 cycles , each cycle 30 s at 95c , 45 s at 50c , and 45 s at 72c ) . each pcr product was then cleaved by ava i enzyme and the digested pcr products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis . the gels were stained with ethidium bromide and the dna fragments were visualized by an uv transluminator . pcr products acquired from those with a cc genotype were cleaved into two fragments of 190 and 114 bp by ava i enzyme , whereas the pcr products of people with tt genotype was not digested at all , yielding a product of 304 bp . oligonucleotides used for pcr : forward primer : 5-tggcattgatctggttcatc reverse primer : 5-gtttaggaatcttcccactt peripheral blood of patients and healthy individuals was drawn into heparinized tubes , and lymphocytes were isolated with a density gradient method and pipetted into plates ( 210 cells each well ) and incubated for 24 h ( 5% co2 , 37c ) in an rpmi 1640 culture medium including 10% fcs with ( 0.5 ng / ml ) or without lps . the cells were precipitated by centrifuge at 1600 rpm for 10 min after 4 and 24 h. the supernatants were transferred to another tube and stored at 80c until elisa analyses . il1 levels in cell culture supernatants were studied according to the manufacturer s protocol ( ebioscience , cat . n. 88 -

hs admitted to the akdeniz university hospital neurology department , turkey , were enrolled in this study . a control group of 32 healthy volunteers with matching age , gender ratio and ethnic origins was also included . diagnosis of mtlehs was based on clinical history , electroencephalography , magnetic resonance imaging , and , in some patients , on histopathological findings after the selective amgydalahippocampectomy and anterior temporal lobectomy . the control subjects had no history of seizures or neurological disorders and no central nervous system or other infections at the time of blood sample collection . peripheral venous blood samples ( 3 ml ) were collected from each subject into vacutainer tubes containing edta . dna was extracted from blood samples using the robotic system magnapure ( roche ) and the amount of dna was measured by spectrophotometer . the -511 region of il-1 gene has been genotyped with polymerase chain reaction -

7010 ) . all statistical analysis was carried out using statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) windows version 15.0 ( spss inc . , tests for differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies were performed using 2 test and fisher s exact test . there was no significant difference between the mtle - hs patients and controls according to genotype and allele frequencies of il-1-511 . levels of secreted il-1 from the cultured lymphocytes incubated either with or without lps were measured at three different time frames during the culture period ( basal , 4 h and 24 h ) . however , no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups ( table 3 ) . since il-1-511 t allele has been suggested to be associated with increased in vitro production of il-1 and that il-1 is involved in hs pathogenesis , we also analyzed the il-1 secretion between the patients and control individuals who carry the t allele at position -511 of the il-1 gene . however , although spontaneous secretion levels of il-1 were higher in mtle - hs patients , there was no significant difference between the groups ( figure 1 ) . in addition , despite the fact that both spontaneous and stimulated secretion levels of il-1 were higher in mtle - hs patients who carry the t allele with respect to those patients who do not , the difference was not statistically significant ( figure 2 ) . in this study , we found that neither the il-1 -511 c / t polymorphism nor the secreted il-1 from the cultured lymphocytes were associated with mtle - hs in a group of turkish patients . in our study , the average age of onset of seizures and gender were similar to those presented in other studies . on the other hand , the incidence of history of febrile seizures was found to be 76.7% , which was higher than the values mentioned in several previous reports . cytokine proteins have both pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory forms . among proinflammatory cytokines , three biallelic polymorphisms in il-1 , all of which result from c to t transitions at positions -511 , -31 or + 3954 from the transcriptional start site , have been most frequently evaluated for their association with diverse conditions besides epilepsy . chen et al . demonstrated that the il-1-511 t allele strongly enhanced the transcription of the il-1 gene in the context of the il-1-31 c allele . il-1-511 t single nucleotide polymorphism has been thought to be associated with mtlehs and febrile seizures . previously showed no association between il-1 gene polymorphism and tle with hs in turkish ancestry in a larger group . recently , a meta - analysis and a review was published by kauffman et al . demonstrating a modest association between the il-1-511 t polymorphism and tle with hs . in the current study , we did not find any significant difference between mtlehs patients and control group with respect to the genotype and allele frequencies of il-1-511 ( table 2 ) . in this study , the frequency of t / t genotype was found to be 15.6% whereas , it was reported to be 18% and 20.5% in european and japanese populations , respectively . during the acute phases of status epilepticus , upregulation of il-1 occurred in activated microglia and astrocytes and sustained inflammation was only evident in astrocytes during epileptogenesis . in chronic epileptic tissue , il-1 was still expressed by astrocytes , and it resumed in microglia when rats displayed a high frequency of spontaneous seizures . these findings demonstrated that il-1 is chronically over - expressed in astrocytes after status epilepticus , and il-1 expression in microglia is related to ongoing and severe epileptic activity . together with il-1 , tnf- and il-6 levels increase rapidly after the induction of seizures , then decline to basal levels within 48 - 72 h of the onset of seizures . but il-1 is still up - regulated in the brain 60 days after status epilepticus in rats with spontaneous seizures . the recent data suggested that lipopolysaccharide mimics the actions of an endogenously released protein called high mobility group box 1 that interacts with tolllike receptor 4 to promote seizures . il-1 and high mobility group box 1 activate pathophysiological cascade of inflammatory events in epilepsy through binding to il-1r1 and tolllike receptor 4 , respectively . besides these experimental studies , some clinical studies have measured il-1 secretion from the lymphocytes and serum in febrile seizure and epilepsy patients . showed increased plasma levels of il-6 and levels of il-1 unchanged after seizures in chronic localization - related epilepsy patients . found no difference between febrile seizure patients and controls with respect to serum il-1 levels . reported increased serum levels of il-6 in tle that supported chronic overproduction of cytokines in refractory focal epilepsy . on the other hand , measurement of the secreted il-1 levels from stimulated lymphocytes can differ from serum levels . demonstrated that il-1 secretion from the lymphocytes was significantly higher in febrile seizure patients . in another study ( haspolat , unpublished data , 2008 ) , significantly increased levels of il-1 from lps - stimulated mononuclear cells at 24 h were observed in complicated febrile seizure patients compared to simple ones . although these findings suggest that the increased levels of il-1 in mtle - hs patients may lead to hs and explain epileptogenesis and ictogenesis , in this study we were not able to detect any statistically significant differences in secreted il-1 levels from cultured lymphocytes between the patient and control groups . in addition , comparison of il-1 levels secreted from lymphocytes obtained from individuals carrying a t allele at the -511 position of the il-1 gene to those obtained from individuals who do not carry the t allele did not reveal any significant difference either . interestingly , however , the spontaneous and stimulated levels of il-1 secretion were higher in mtle - hs patients carrying the t allele with respect to the patients who do not . the relatively small number of patients and controls could explain the reason why a statistically significant difference was not observed in this study . in addition , it should be kept in mind that promoter regulation is a complex mechanism involving a large variety of transcription factors acting together . thus , besides ( -511 ) polymorphism , a combination of different haplotypes and many other transcription factors binding to different sites should impinge on the transcriptional activity . in conclusion , in experimental studies , activation of cytokines has been observed especially in areas of onset of seizures and spreading of discharge . in clinical studies , cytokine levels in peripheral blood seem to reflect the central nervous system s production of cytokines , but these are not always correlated .","mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis ( mtle - hs ) is a common medically intractable epilepsy syndrome . 
 although pathogenesis of hs still remains highly controversial , genetics may play a role as a predisposing factor . 
 previous evidence in a japanese population revealed that the homozygotes for allele t at position -511 of the interleukin ( il)-1 gene promoter region ( il-1-511 t / t ) confers susceptibility to the development of hs . 
 however , whether this polymorphism has an effect on il-1 levels in mtlehs patients was not demonstrated . 
 this study aimed to analyze the distribution of this particular polymorphism in a group of turkish hs patients and correlate the polymorphism with il-1 secretion from the lymphocytes , thus revealing a functional role for il-1 in the etiopathogenesis of hs . 
 a single base pair polymorphism at position 511 in the promoter region of the il-1 gene was analyzed . 
 the spontaneous and 1 ng / ml lipopolysaccharidestimulated production of il-1 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells after 4 and 24 h of incubation were measured by elisa method . the heterozygous type ( 511 c / t ) was the most common genotype . 
 there was no difference in frequency of allele 511 t between patients and controls . 
 analysis of il-1 levels , genotype and allele distributions showed no significant difference among the groups ( p>0.05 ) . 
 nevertheless , it was seen that patients who carry a t allele at position -511 of the il-1 gene had increased il-1 levels . 
 t - allele carriage may be important . 
 only il-1 secretion from the lymphocytes has been assessed in this study . 
 considering the importance of il-1 in the etiopathogenesis of hs , further studies are needed to evaluate locally produced il-1 levels .",393
"the nonclassical hla - g molecule presents several properties that differ from other classical class i hla ( -a , -b , and -c ) molecules , including restricted tissue distribution ; limited protein variability ; presence of several membrane - bound and soluble isoforms ; unique molecular structure , presenting a particular peptide - binding groove that impairs peptide presentation to t cells ; ability to form dimers and polymers and a reduced cytoplasmic tail that impairs molecule turnover ; and , most importantly , the molecule that modulates several functions of immune system cells ( reviewed by ) . the interaction of hla - g with leukocyte receptors , particularly ilt-2 and ilt-4 , downregulates the cytotoxic activity of t cd8 and natural killer cells and inhibits antigen presentation and lymphocyte proliferation [ 1 , 2 ] . due to all of these properties , hla - g has been recognized as a tolerogenic molecule , and the tissue expression of hla - g may protect or harm ; that is , it may protect allografts against attack by the recipient immune system and may impair the cytotoxic immune response against tumor cells . the coding region exhibits few polymorphic sites randomly distributed along exons and introns , contrasting with the high rate of exonic polymorphic sites observed in classical hla class i genes . the exonic nucleotide sequences encoding residues that are important for molecule dimerization and molecule interaction with leucocyte receptors are usually conserved , indicating that the overall structure of the molecule was maintained throughout human evolution [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] . considering that hla - g is expressed on the surface of placenta trophoblast cells , allowing the fetus to properly develop despite the maternal immune response , some sort of functional conservation was expected . on the other hand , gene regulatory regions present several polymorphic sites close to nucleotide sequences that serve as gene regulatory elements [ 69 ] . nucleotide variability in the promoter region may influence hla - g levels by modifying binding affinity for transcription factors . in contrast to classical hla class i genes , the promoter region of hla - g does not have responsive elements for ifn- or nf-b . similarly , nucleotide variability at the 3 untranslated region ( 3utr ) may influence hla - g mrna stability , microrna targeting , or both , affecting the posttranscriptional gene regulation . considering that the structure of hla - g molecules has been maintained throughout evolution , the quantity of produced molecules may primarily depend on factors that modulate gene expression by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms . firstly , we will review the structure of the hla - g promoter region and its implication in transcriptional gene control ; secondly , the structure of the hla - g 3utr and the major actors of the posttranscriptional gene control ; and , finally , the presence of elements in the coding region that may regulate gene expression and differential mrna splicing . there is no consensus regarding the positions of the nucleotide variation in the hla - g promoter and 3utr , mainly because ( i ) the imgt / hla database only presents sequences within 300 bases upstream to the first translated atg , ( ii ) the complete 3utr gene segment is not considered in the imgt database , and ( iii ) several hla alleles were described presenting only some exon sequences . therefore , the nucleotide positions used in the present study follow the one presented in the ng_029039 sequence ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ng_029039 ) . the nucleotide named as + 1 is the adenine of the first translated atg ( position 5867 at ng_029039 ) . variations within regulatory elements in the upstream 5 untranslated region and 5 promoter were denoted as negative values , considering position 5866 at ng_029039 as nucleotide 1 . the hla class i genes are usually very similar in nucleotide sequence and structure because most of these genes have been generated in a series of imperfect duplications . therefore , in general , the same regulatory elements are acting in hla class i genes , with some differences for each hla class i locus . the hla class i promoters are usually conserved , presenting cis - acting regulatory elements mainly within 220 bases upstream to the first translated atg . however , the hla - g promoter is atypical compared to other hla class i genes since most of these regulatory elements are not functional . the hla - g locus presents a tissue - restricted expression pattern , being expressed in physiological conditions only in certain tissues such as trophoblast at the maternal - fetal interface , thymus , cornea , pancreas , proximal nail matrix , erythroblast , and mesenchymal stem cells [ 1 , 1118 ] . in view of the immunomodulatory properties of the hla - g molecule overall , hla class i genes present two main regulatory modules in the proximal promoter region ( 200 bases upstream to the translation start point ) , including ( i ) the enhancer a ( enha ) combined with an interferon - stimulated response element ( isre ) and ( ii ) the sxy module , in which the transcription apparatus is mounted ( figure 1 ) [ 1924 ] . however , these regulatory elements present locus - specific differences leading to different levels of hla class i constitutive- and induced - expression ( reviewed at [ 24 , 25 ] ) . the enha element includes two adjacent palindromic nf-b binding sites ( b1 and b2 ) that interact with the nf-b family of transcription factors , both important to the constitutive and/or induced expression of hla class i genes . this family includes several members , such as p50 , p65 ( also known as rela ) , p52 , c - rel , and relb , all usually acting by forming homo- or heterodimers . theoretically , the interaction of these factors with the enha element may transactivate ( acting on any b binding site ) any hla class i gene . thus , the hla locus - specific transcription rate would be determined by ( i ) the levels of nf-b / rel family proteins in different tissues , ( ii ) modifications in the regulatory sequences , and ( iii ) potential activation of different nf-b / rel dimers . in addition , enha may be a target sequence for other dna - binding proteins , such as proteins of the leucine zipper transcription factor family . for instance , p65 has a potent transactivation domain and might operate as a p65/p50 heterodimer or p65/p65 homodimer , while p50 lacks this transactivation domain and may not transactivate as a p50/p50 homodimer . enha also mediates the tnf - induced transcription of hla class i molecules [ 20 , 29 ] . due to variations in the enha nucleotide sequences among different hla class i genes , nf-b / rel factors may interact as homo- or heterodimers resulting in different transcription levels . the hla - g enha element ( including b1 and b2 sites ) encompasses nucleotides 198 and 172 ( regarding ng_029039 ) and , compared to other hla class i genes , it is the most divergent one [ 19 , 20 ] . in fact , the b - sites in the hla - g promoter ( enha ) are reported to bind only p50/p50 homodimers   ( figure 1 ) . as presented earlier , thus , although hla - g possesses an nf-b responsive element , it is not as efficient as the hla class i classical genes . isre is a target site for the interferon regulatory factor family , including the interferon regulatory factor-1 ( irf-1 , activator ) , irf-2 , and irf-8 ( inhibitors ) . interferon- ( ifn- ) is the most potent cytokine inducing hla class i gene expression . ifn- induces the expression of irf-1 by the activation of the janus kinases ( jak ) 1 and 2 and phosphorylation of stat1 ( jak / stat pathway ) [ 19 , 21 ] . isre is adjacent to the enha element ( constituting the module enha / isre presented earlier ) and , thus , isre and enha regulate hla class i expression cooperatively ( figure 1 ) . isre also participates in the transactivation of 2-microglobulin , which is associated with the heavy  chain of the hla class i molecule , and this information is important because an unbalanced production of these chains may impair correct hla molecule assembly . the nucleotide sequence of isre also varies among hla class i loci . in this respect , locus - specific differences were observed in the ifn - induced expression levels of hla class i genes [ 21 , 2931 ] . the hla - a locus , for instance , does not respond to ifn at the same level as hla - b and hla - c , probably because of differences in the isre structure [ 19 , 21 , 2931 ] . however , when comparing isre of the hla - g locus with other class i genes , encompassing nucleotides 171 to 161 , the hla - g gene presents the most divergent isre compared to the isre consensus sequence , followed by hla - e [ 19 , 21 ] , raising the issue of whether or not this element is fully functional for hla - g and hla - e . in fact , neither hla - g nor hla - e isres mediate ifn--induced transactivation , and the binding of irf-1 is not detected for hla - g . however , in the same way , probably because of the defective nature of the hla - g isre , the binding of irf-2 ( transcription repression ) was also not detected for hla - g . isre is also a target for other protein complexes that may mediate hla class i transactivation . however , hla - gb2 ( enha ) and isre seem to bind only the constitutively expressed factor sp1 ( also known as specificity protein 1 ) [ 21 , 25 ] . nevertheless , the binding of sp1 does not modulate the constitutive or ifn - induced transactivation of hla class i genes , including hla - g . on the other hand , a candidate interferon - gamma activated site ( gas ) was described between the 741 and 733 positions , presenting a sequence that would be compatible with a gas consensus sequence ( figure 1 ) . however , besides this new candidate , ifn- , ifn- , and ifn- treatments failed to increase hla - g expression , a fact that was accredited to the defective nature of both the new candidate and the enha / isre region [ 3234 ] . nonetheless , another study showed that ifn- enhances hla - g expression by another isre present next to the nonfunctional gas element at positions 754 to 743 . the sxy module comprises the s , x1 , and x2 ( also known as site  ) boxes and the y box ( also known as the enhancer b or ccaat box ) . the x1 box is a target for the multiprotein complex regulatory factor x ( rfx ) , including the rfx5 , the regulatory factor x - associated protein ( rfxap ) , and rfxank [ 20 , 25 , 35 , 36 ] . these rfx members have been shown to interact with the class ii transactivator ( ciita ) [ 37 , 38 ] , which is also an important element for hla class i gene transactivation . the x2 box is a binding target for the atf / creb ( activating transcription factor / camp response element binding protein ) transcription factor family . box y is a binding target for nuclear factor y ( nfy ) , including subunits alpha ( nfya ) , beta ( nfyb ) , and gamma ( nfyc ) [ 25 , 40 ] . the binding of these factors to the sxy module allows the further binding of the coactivator ciita and the nod - like receptor family card domain containing 5 ( nlrc5 ) factors [ 25 , 41 , 42 ] . the ciita is constitutively expressed by antigen presenting cells and is induced by ifn- , and it transactivates hla class i genes [ 41 , 43 ] . nlrc5 transactivates hla class i genes ( but not hla class ii ) and is constitutively expressed in a series of different tissues , mainly hematopoietic cells , or is induced by inf- [ 4446 ] . for hla - g , the sxy module presents sequences compatible only with the s and x1 elements , but divergent from x2 and y elements ( figure 1 ) . therefore , ciita , which is dependent on a functional sxy module , does not transactivate hla - g , mainly because of the missing x2 and y elements [ 25 , 41 , 42 , 47 , 48 ] . considering all the elements discussed above , it became clear that the hla - g proximal promoter ( within 200 bases ) did not mediate transactivation by the principal hla class i transactivation mechanisms . in addition , studies evaluating the hla - g promoter region within 1438  bp from atg did not detect differences in the basal level of transactivation for different hla - g promoters in different cell types [ 49 , 50 ] . some alternative regulatory elements within the hla - g gene promoter have been described . a heat shock element ( hse ) which would respond to the presence of heat shock proteins ( hsp ) , especially the heat shock factor 1 ( hsf1 ) , hla - g transcription is induced by heat shock ( physical stress ) or arsenate treatment ( chemical stress ) in human melanoma and glioblastoma cell lines , in which stress - induced hsf1 binds to an hse lying between the 464 and 453 positions . this hse response was detected for hla - g but not for other hla class i genes . hla - g expression may also be induced by progesterone , which is an immunomodulatory steroid hormone secreted both by the corpus luteum and placenta , allowing endometrium maintenance and embryo implantation . the mechanism underlying this induction is primarily mediated by the activation of the progesterone receptor ( pr ) and its subsequent binding to an alternative progesterone response element ( pre ) found in the hla - g promoter between positions 52 and 38 , overlapping the hla - g tata box   ( figure 1 ) . experiments with transgenic mice allowed the identification of a locus control region ( lcr ) candidate located at least 1.2  kb upstream to the first translated atg . this region is critical for the hla - g expression regarding when and where it should be expressed . it is possible that this region acts by maintaining the chromatin in an open state or active configuration , enhancing gene expression [ 54 , 55 ] . in addition , it may bind protein complexes associated with activation and inhibition of hla - g transcription [ 56 , 57 ] . at least three cre / tre candidate sites ( camp response element / tpa response element ) have been already considered , the first one being situated between the 1387 and 1371 positions ( inside the putative lcr region discussed earlier ) , the second between the 941 and 935 positions , and the third between the 777 and 771 positions ( figure 1 ) . the first cre site ( at lcr ) was described to be an in vitro target site for c - jun by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) . c - jun , together with c - fos , forms the ap-1 early response transcription factor . in addition , this same site was reported to bind atf1/creb1 in vitro and in situ by using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) . the second cre / tre site binds in vitro to creb1 and the third site binds in vitro to atf1/creb1 . mutations in all three cre / tre sites have been reported to reduce the hla - g creb1 transactivation , but a stronger inhibition was observed when the first cre / tre site ( at the lcr ) was mutated . the repressor factor rreb1 ( ras responsive element binding 1 ) may also be implicated in hla - g expression regulation . at least three binding sites for rreb1 , known as ras response elements ( rre ) , in the hla - g promoter region have been described . the consensus sequence ggtcct , corresponding to one of the binding sites for rreb1 , was found in the proximal promoter between the 59 and 54 positions ( one direct site ) and between the 148 and 143 positions and the 139 and 134 positions ( a direct site and an inverted site ) . a target site related to the other consensus - binding site for rreb1 , ccccaccatcccc , was found within the lcr between the 1363 and 1358 positions ( figure 1 ) . the mechanism underlying rreb1 repression is probably associated with the recruitment of the corepressor c - terminal binding protein 1 or 2 ( ctbp-1 or ctbp-2 ) , or both , and the deacetylase 1 ( hdac1 ) , which is involved in chromatin remodeling probably increasing chromatin condensation and hampering transcription factor accessibility [ 58 , 59 ] . the gli-3 repressor , a signal transducer of the hedgehog pathway ( hh ) , has also been reported to regulate hla - g during the maturation of osteoblasts , especially in the production of the hla - g5 isoform . it acts by a direct interaction of the hh signaling transducer factor gli-3 with the hla - g promoter . however , it is not clear whether the hh signaling pathway , a highly conserved molecular pathway involved in the development of several tissues , directly regulates hla - g5 expression in other cell types . a negative regulator of gene expression is observed in a sequence about 4  kb upstream to the hla - g translation starting point , overlapping with a line-1 sequence   ( figure 1 ) . lines ( long interspersed elements ) are a group of retrotransposons , which are highly repetitive elements from the eukaryotic genome that contribute to genome variability . the line-1 element described for hla - g ( named gl ) is an at - rich sequence ( about 60% ) that presents more sites with a high probability of forming hairpin loops than the general line sequence . these hairpin loops might directly or indirectly interact with the hla - g promoter and interfere with the binding of transcriptional factors and enhancers . line elements are frequently found lying in the 5 upstream regulatory region of other hla class i genes , including hla - a . however , the line sequence found in the hla - a promoter ( named al ) is not transcriptionally active and is shorter than the one found in hla - g ( gl ) . therefore , the presence of this gl element in the hla - g promoter would explain its limited expression compared with other class i genes . however , it should be noticed that this gl element is also present in hla - g - expressing cells ; thus , other regulatory elements might inhibit or overcome this negative regulation . hypoxia is an important physiological microenvironment for placentation and for the formation of the maternal - fetal interface . the microenvironment is also crucial for the function of t and b cells . in this scenario , the hypoxia - inducible factor ( hif ) is involved in the control of cellular responses to oxygen depletion . the hla - g expression ( membrane and soluble ) is 2 times increased when extravillous cytotrophoblasts are cultivated under only 2% oxygen . likewise , hypoxia is associated with increased hla - g transcription in a series of hla - g - negative tumor lineages , such as 1074mel [ 64 , 65 ] and m8 . a consensus hypoxia response element ( hre ) some inducers of hla - g expression have been described ; but the underlying induction mechanisms are unknown . interleukin 10 ( il-10 ) , which is produced by lymphocytes , monocytes , macrophages , placenta , and some tumors , may induce hla - g expression and the downregulation of other hla class i and ii genes [ 6870 ] . cortisol , a glucocorticoid produced by the adrenal gland , is a potent immunomodulatory hormone at high doses . hla - g expression in trophoblastic cells was increased following treatment with dexamethasone or hydrocortisone , but no complete glucocorticoid response element ( gre ) has been identified in the hla - g promoter . granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) is a protein secreted by macrophages , t cells , mast cells , nk cells , endothelial cells , fibroblasts , and uterine epithelium . gm - csf increases hla - g expression when combined with inf- treatment , but no effect is observed for gm - csf alone [ 72 , 73 ] . the leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) is a cytokine expressed at the maternal - fetal interface in the cytotrophoblast that plays an important role in implantation . lif is mainly expressed in the implantation window . by using the choriocarcinoma cell line jeg3 , it was demonstrated that lif induces full - length membrane hla - g ( hla - g1 ) expression on the jeg3 cell surface . in addition , lif may induce hla - g1 expression in the presence of erap1 ( endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 ) expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum . repression of erap1 in jeg3 cells treated with lif diminishes hla - g expression , suggesting a role for erap in hla - g regulation . some drugs may also induce hla - g production , such as methotrexate ( mtx ) , one of the most used antirheumatic drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) . mtx can induce apoptosis of mitogen - stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) resembling the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of cytotoxic t cd8 + cell activity by soluble hla - g molecules . mtx can induce the production of shla - g in unstimulated ra or healthy individual pbmcs and may have a role in the clinical outcome of ra patients . the mechanisms underlying shla - g production after mtx treatment are unknown , but it was reported that mtx therapy mediates an increase of interleukin-10-producing cells , which in turn may stimulate hla - g production . data from the 1000 genomes project , including 1092 individuals from 14 different populations , showed 32 variable sites within 1500 nucleotides upstream to the first translated atg . most of these variable sites have been already described in other populations or samples different from those evaluated by the 1000 genomes consortium [ 69 , 7781 ] . of those , 24 variable sites present frequencies higher than 1% and 14 present frequencies higher than 10% in the global 1000 genomes data ( all 1092 individuals ) . these variable sites may be important for the regulation of hla - g expression and may act in different ways . polymorphisms in the proximal promoter of paan - ag , the functional homologue of hla - g in the olive baboon , have been shown to influence nf-b binding and transcription activity [ 82 , 83 ] . however , the human variable sites may act by mechanisms differing from those described above because , generally , these variable sites do not coincide with known regulatory elements ( figure 1 ) . variation in regulatory elements may affect the binding of the corresponding regulatory factors . in this respect , only four variable sites coincide with known regulatory elements : ( i ) position 1377 in the first cre site of the lcr , ( ii ) positions 1310 and 1305 of the lcr , and ( iii ) position 56 of the ras response element ( rre ) in the proximal promoter . of these , only the ones at positions 1305 and 56 are frequently found worldwide ( figure 1 ) . other variable sites are close to known regulatory elements and may somehow influence the binding of transcription factors . in this group we may observe variable sites at positions 762 ( between a cre and isre ) , 725 ( next to a nonfunctional gas element ) , 477 and 433 ( around the hse ) , and 201 ( next to enhancer a ) ( figure 1 ) . the variable site at position 725 , in which the minor allele ( g ) is present in 9.8% of the chromosomes evaluated in the 1000 genomes project , was associated with differential hla - g expression . hla - g promoter haplotypes ( between 1389 and 55 and not considering primer sequences ) were cloned into luciferase expression vectors and transfected to the hla - g expressing cell jeg-3 , resulting in a significantly higher expression level of the promoters presenting guanine at position 725 . in addition , another study described the same influence of position 725 on hla - g expression levels . this same polymorphism ( 725 g ) has been reported to be associated with sporadic miscarriage   and end - stage renal disease , while the most frequent allele ( 725 c ) has been reported to protect against multiple sclerosis . nevertheless , despite the lack of studies regarding hla - g promoter polymorphisms and hla - g expression , the polymorphism at position 964 , which is very frequent among the populations evaluated by the 1000 genomes consortium , was associated with asthma . the 964 g / g genotype was associated with asthmatic children of affected mothers , whereas the a / a genotype was associated with asthmatic children of unaffected mothers . the 964 a and 486 c alleles , together with the 725 g allele , were also associated with protection against end - stage renal disease . the polymorphism at position 1305 , also very frequent among the 1000 genomes populations , was associated with nonsegmental vitiligo . the methylation status of the hla - g promoter is also very important to the hla - g transcriptional activity . it has been reported that the cpg islands in the hla - g promoter region of jar ( choriocarcinoma ) cells , which does not express hla - g , were fully methylated , whereas for an hla - g expressing cell such as jeg-3 , the cpg islands were only partially methylated [ 91 , 92 ] . in addition , hla - g expression was induced in several tumor cell lines by using demethylation agents , such as 5-aza-2deoxycytidine [ 9397 ] . moreover , the levels of histone acetylation in the hla - g promoter chromatin have been reported to be significantly enhanced in fon+ ( melanoma ) and jeg-3 ( human placental choriocarcinoma cell line ) cell lines , both expressing hla - g , while in non - hla - g expressing cell lines , such as m8 ( melanoma ) and jar , histones seem to be hypomethylated [ 94 , 96 , 98 ] . histone acetylation is usually associated with a relaxed chromatin structure , therefore , with greater levels of gene expression [ 99 , 100 ] . in this respect , polymorphisms in the hla - g promoter , especially in the cpg islands , might also be associated with different methylation profiles . although most of the hla - g promoter variable sites do not occur inside known regulatory elements ( figure 1 ) , balancing selection has been reported to maintain divergent haplotypes in the 5 promoter [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 78 , 79 ] and 3utr regulatory regions [ 6 , 27 , 28 , 78 , 101 , 102 ] . in fact , at least 14 variable sites in the promoter region do present frequencies higher than 10% , and 11 variable sites present frequencies higher than 44% ( figure 1 ) . however , considering the haplotypes described for the hla - g promoter , which seem to be the same worldwide [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 7779 ] , most of these frequent variable sites are in complete linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) , and just four main hla - g promoter lineages are associated with these variable sites . these promoter lineages were first proposed by ober 's group   and subsequently confirmed and named in a brazilian study as promo - g010101 , promo - g010102 , promo - g0103 , and promo - g0104 . in addition , considering data from the 1000 genomes project , only nine promoter haplotypes present frequencies higher than 1% in worldwide populations ( figure 2 ) , but two of them , promo - g010101a and promo - g010102a , which are the most divergent ones , account for more than 60% of all haplotypes . nevertheless , despite the fact that most of these frequent hla - g variable sites are not within known regulatory elements , several lines of evidence indicate balancing selection acting on the hla - g promoter found in several populations [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 78 , 79 ] , suggesting that divergent promoters have been maintained with high heterozygosis . this observation is probably related to a possible better fitness of individuals carrying both high- and low - expressing promoters . therefore , these divergent hla - g promoter haplotypes are probably associated with differential hla - g expression , but the mechanisms are unknown . however , as discussed later , the pattern of ld observed for the promoter region extends up to hla - g 3utr [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 27 , 7779 ] and at least 20  kb beyond the hla - g 3utr . thus , selective pressures acting on other hla - g regions as well as adjacent sequences might also influence hla - g promoter variability and heterozygosis . as previously stated , there is no consensus regarding the positions of the nucleotide variation in the hla - g 3utr , considered to be located mostly in exon 8 . since there is no official information regarding the hla - g 3utr sequences , the nucleotide positions used in the present study follow those previously reported by our group [ 1 , 6 , 27 ] , that is , inferring polymorphic sites in 3utr using the original hla - g sequence described by geraghty and colleagues   and considering nucleotide + 1 as the adenine of the first translated atg ( similar to the imgt / hla description ) . in the hla - g 3utr , there is a well - studied polymorphism that consists of a 14-nucleotide deletion ( rs371194629 or rs66554220 ) , also known as the 14-bp indel ( insertion / deletion ) polymorphism . the sequence used as a model for the hla - g promoter structure ( ng_029039 ) does not present this 14-nucleotide sequence ( that would be inserted between nucleotides + 2960 and + 2961 ) . given that the presence of these 14 nucleotides is also found in gorillas and chimpanzees , it should represent the ancestor allele , and the 14 bp sequence therefore , any position after nucleotide + 2960 is taken considering the original ng_029039 sequence plus 14 bases . for instance , the polymorphism at the + 3142 position discussed later in this review refers to the + 3128 nucleotide in the ng_029039 reference sequence . due to a premature stop codon ( positions + 2536 to + 2538 in ng_029039 ) , the hla - g gene presents a relatively large 3utr genomic sequence that extends up to the + 3292 nucleotide , encompassing approximately 754 nucleotides . inside the 3utr genomic region , there is an intron that is spliced out , giving rise to the mature hla - g mrna with a 3utr sequence of approximately 397 nucleotides ( considering the presence of the 14 bases discussed earlier ) . this 3utr is a key feature for transcriptional hla - g regulation , which is important for ( i ) hla - g mrna stability , ( ii ) targeting specific micrornas , and ( iii ) polyadenylation signal in the au - rich regulatory mrna element . the mrna availability for translation , as well as consequent protein production and maturation , is constantly balanced by the opposing forces of transcription levels and mrna decay . the transcription level is mainly driven by the 5 ' regulatory region and the presence of specific transcription factors , while mrna decay is mainly driven by its intrinsic stability ( which is dependent on the nucleotide sequence ) and the action of micrornas . micrornas may negatively regulate gene expression by translation suppression , rna degradation , or both [ 104 , 106108 ] . the first mirna was reported in 1993 , and more than 2000 human micrornas have been reported to date [ 110 , 111 ] . the hla - g 3utr presents several polymorphic sites , some of which have been associated with differential hla - g expression profiles . although the hla - g 3utr segment is quite short compared to the same region in other genes , it presents at least eight polymorphic sites that are frequently found in worldwide populations ( figure 3 ) . the hla - g 3utr variability and haplotypes were systematically explored in a southeastern brazilian population , in which seven frequent haplotypes were described , encompassing these eight polymorphic sites , designated utr-1 to utr-7 , and a rare one named utr-8 . the relationship between hla - g 3utr polymorphisms ( especially for the 14 bp polymorphism ) and other variable sites in the hla - g coding and promoter region was also previously explored [ 77 , 78 , 105 , 112 , 113 ] . furthermore , several populations were evaluated regarding these polymorphic sites , including additional samples from other brazilian regions and other worldwide populations , and the same pattern of 3utr variability has been observed [ 6 , 27 , 28 , 85 , 102 , 114121 ] . recently , the variability at the hla - g locus was explored by using the 1000 genomes data [ 28 , 102 ] and , taking together all of these studies in the last decade , it became clear that the same 3utr pattern observed in brazilians   is found worldwide , with just some new low frequency haplotypes . most of the polymorphisms present in the hla - g 3utr may influence the hla - g expression profile by different mechanisms . since they are present in a short mrna sequence with just some nucleotides apart , and since the pattern of haplotypes is quite conserved [ 28 , 102 ] , the influence of each polymorphic site on the hla - g expression profile may not be independent of other polymorphic sites ; that is , extended haplotypes should be considered due to the cumulative effects of different polymorphisms . for example , the + 3003 , + 3010 , + 3027 , and + 3035 polymorphic sites encompass only 32 nucleotides that are also in linkage disequilibrium with each other and in linkage disequilibrium with variable sites in the coding and promoter segments   ( figure 3 ) . the first hla - g 3utr polymorphic site associated with hla - g expression levels was an indel ( insertion / deletion ) variant known as the 14 bp polymorphism . this polymorphism is characterized by the removal of a 14-nucleotide segment   between positions + 2961 and + 2974 , and it presents high frequency in all populations studied so far . the ancestor allele ( the 14 bp presence or insertion ) is also found in gorillas and chimpanzees . the 14 bp polymorphism has been associated with the magnitude of hla - g production [ 77 , 123125 ] , modulating hla - g mrna stability [ 113 , 126128 ] and also as a target for micrornas . in general , the presence of the 14-nucleotide sequence ( 5-atttgttcatgcct-3 ) has been associated with lower hla - g production for most membrane - bound and soluble isoforms in trophoblast samples [ 77 , 78 , 123 , 125 , 128 ] . however , svendsen and colleagues observed the opposite when k562 cells were transduced with ins-14  bp hla - g1 or with del-14  bp hla - g1 , in which the expression of hla - g1 was found to be higher for ins-14  bp cells compared to del-14  bp cells . moreover , this 14-base sequence was also associated with an alternative splicing of the hla - g transcript , in which 92 bases from the mature 3utr hla - g mrna were removed ( including the 14-base sequence itself ) [ 113 , 128 ] , and these smaller transcripts were reported to be more stable than the complete transcript . though influencing mrna stability , only a fraction of the mrna bearing these 14 nucleotides is further processed with the removal of 92 bases , and the greater stability apparently does not compensate for the lower hla - g levels associated with the 14-base sequence . nevertheless , there are controversial results regarding the influence of this polymorphism in hla - g expression and alternative splicing . the following four polymorphic sites , frequently found in the hla - g 3utr in worldwide populations , are present at positions + 3003 , + 3010 , + 3027 , and + 3035 [ 6 , 27 ] . although no specific regulation mechanism has been described regarding these polymorphic sites , they might influence microrna binding . additional polymorphic sites around this small hla - g 3utr segment are infrequently observed in worldwide populations , including the + 3001 c / t polymorphism observed in senegalese and northeastern brazilian populations [ 115 , 116 ] and the + 3033 c / g polymorphism observed among northeastern brazilians . although there are no studies evaluating the functional properties of these polymorphic sites , an in silico study reported that several micrornas might target this small segment . the nucleotide variation at position + 3142 has been associated with the magnitude of hla - g expression by posttranscription mechanisms , such as the interaction with micrornas . it was functionally and computationally demonstrated that this variation site would influence the binding of specific micrornas , including mir-148a , mir-148b , and mir-152 . the presence of a guanine at the + 3142 position increases the affinity of this region for these micrornas , hence decreasing hla - g expression by mrna degradation and translation suppression [ 106 , 129 , 130 ] . this polymorphism , together with the 14-bp polymorphism , has been considered to be the most important one regarding hla - g posttranscription regulation , and methodologies have been proposed to quickly type these polymorphic sites [ 131 , 132 ] . at least two studies have demonstrated that the + 3142 c / g polymorphic site may influence hla - g expression by modulating the mrna interaction with mir-152 , particularly in bronchial asthma [ 129 , 133 ] . however , there is no consensus regarding the influence of this polymorphic site on the binding of such micrornas , since another functional study did not detect this influence . instead , it was reported that both mir-148a and mir-152 downregulate hla - g expression , irrespective of the + 3142 c or g alleles . these micrornas have already been reported to modulate the expression of another classical hla class i gene , hla - c . interestingly , only hla - c and hla - g are usually found at the maternal - fetal interface , indicating the presence of some sort of coordinated regulation . similarly to mir-148a , mir-148b , and mir-152 , other micrornas have the potential to bind to the hla - g mrna 3utr and to influence hla - g expression . the binding ability of these micrornas may be potentially influenced by polymorphisms observed in the hla - g 3utr . another polymorphic site that has been associated with the magnitude of hla - g expression is located at position + 3187 a / g . the mechanism underlying such association has been attributed to the proximity of this polymorphic site to an au - rich motif that mediates mrna degradation . then , the presence of an adenine instead of a guanine at position + 3187 would lead to a decreased hla - g expression due to the increased number of adenines in this au - rich motif . in addition to the micrornas that might target polymorphic sequences in the hla - g 3utr , some micrornas would bind to nonpolymorphic sequences and modulate hla - g expression irrespectively of the individual genetic background . however , such approach has not yet been used and only micrornas targeting polymorphic sequences have been evaluated . nevertheless , the microrna mir-133a was found to target a nonpolymorphic sequence upstream to the 14-b sequence fragment , between nucleotides + 2945 and + 2952 , downregulating hla - g expression ( figure 3 ) . the conserved patterns of hla - g 3utr haplotypes and the few frequent haplotypes found worldwide [ 102 , 116 ] show that only one haplotype does carry all alleles that have been associated with high hla - g expression . this haplotype , known as hla - g utr-1   ( 14 bp deletion/+3003 t/+3010 g/+3027 c/+3035 c/+3142 c/+3187 g/+3186 c ) , does not present the 14 bp sequence ; that is , it presents a 14 bp deletion , which was associated with highly soluble hla - g expression ; it presents a cytosine at position + 3142 ( less sensitive to specific micrornas targeting this region ) , and it exhibits a guanine at position + 3187 ( increased mrna stability ) . besides possessing these three polymorphic alleles associated with high hla - g production , utr-1 presents some other interesting features : ( i ) it is one of the most frequent 3utr haplotypes found worldwide , ( ii ) it has been described as one of the most recent hla - g 3utr haplotypes among the frequent ones due to its exclusive association with the presence of an alu element that is close to hla - g ( 20  kb downstream the 3utr ) , and ( iii ) utr-1 was recently associated with higher hla - g expression . several studies have reported that the hla - g 3utr segment is also under selective pressures , whereby balancing selection is maintaining high levels of heterozygosis in this region [ 6 , 27 , 28 , 101 , 139 , 140 ] . as observed worldwide [ 27 , 28 , 102 ] , the two most frequent hla - g 3utr haplotypes ( utr-1 and utr-2 ) are also the most divergent ones ( figure 3 ) . therefore , the same phenomenon observed for the promoter region is also seen in the 3utr , in which high heterozygosis is observed between high- and low - expression haplotypes . moreover , the rate of recombination in the hla - g locus is quite low , and the pattern of linkage disequilibrium found in the hla - g locus encompasses the promoter region , the coding region , the 3utr , and at least 20  kb downstream of the 3utr . thus , in general , only few frequent extended haplotypes do exist and a specific promoter haplotype is usually accompanied by the same hla - g coding sequence and the same 3utr haplotype [ 68 , 28 , 77 , 78 , 102 ] . the utr-1 haplotype , for example , is usually associated with the coding sequence for the hla - g*01:01:01:01 allele and the promo - g010101a promoter haplotype [ 68 , 28 , 102 ] . therefore , the influence of each variable site at the hla - g transcriptional level must be considered . the hla - g genetic structure resembles the class i structure , in which the first translated exon encodes the peptide signal , the second , third , and fourth ones encode the extracellular 1 , 2 , and 3 domains , respectively , and the fifth and sixth ones encode the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain of the heavy chain . considering the hla - g coding region ( from the first translated atg to the stop codon ) , at least 75 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) have been observed , defining the 50 currently described hla - g alleles , encoding only 16 distinct proteins ( imgt , database 3.14.0 , november 2013 ) . similarly to what has been described for other genes such as irf4 , myc , ifng , and others [ 141146 ] , it is possible that intronic or exonic nucleotide sequences may exhibit affinity for transcription factors , thereby regulating the expression of the gene ; however , this subject has not yet been studied in the context of the hla - g gene . the presence of certain polymorphic sites in the coding region may also regulate the expression of the seven described hla - g isoforms generated by alternative splicing of the primary transcript . four of the hla - g isoforms are membrane - bound ( hla - g1 , g2 , g3 , and g4 ) and 3 are soluble ( g5 , g6 , and g7 ) ones . hla - g1 is the complete isoform exhibiting a structure similar to that of the membrane - bound classical hla molecule , associated with 2-microglobulin , hla - g2 has no 2 domain , hla - g3 presents no 2 and 3 domains , and hla - g4 has no 3 domain . the soluble hla - g5 and hla - g6 isoforms present the same extracellular domains of hla - g1 and hla - g2 , respectively , and the hla - g7 isoform has only the 1 domain [ 147149 ] . in contrast to most of the currently described hla - g alleles that may produce all membrane - bound and soluble isoforms , the presence of stop codons in the coding region may yield truncated or missing hla - g isoforms . the hla - g*01:05n null allele presents a cytosine deletion in the last nucleotide of codon 129 or in the first nucleotide of codon 130 ( exon 3 ) , leading to a tga stop signal in codon 189 , yielding incomplete formation of the hla - g1 , -g4 , and -g5 isoforms and normal expression of hla - g2 , -g3 , and -g7 [ 1 , 150 , 151 ] . similarly , the hla - g*01:13n allele presents a c  t transition in the first base of codon 54 ( 1 domain ) , yielding the formation of a premature tag stop codon , preventing the production of all membrane - bound and soluble isoforms , and therefore it is probably not expressed [ 1 , 152 , 153 ] . humans bearing allele g*01:05n in homozygosis have been reported [ 154157 ] , a fact that may indicate that soluble hla - g molecules or molecules lacking the 3 domain are sufficient for hla - g function . the frequency of the g*01:05n allele varies among different populations , ranging from complete absence in amerindian populations from the amazon , mayans from guatemala , and uros from peru [ 139 , 151 , 158 ] , to intermediate frequencies in africa   and higher than 15% in some populations of india , while allele g*01:13n is quite rare [ 152 , 153 ] . it has been proposed that high g*01:05n frequencies are associated with high pathogen load regions , and intrauterine pathogens would act as selective agents , with increased survival of g*01:05n heterozygous fetuses . in this case , the reduced hla - g1 expression may result in an improved intrauterine defense against infections [ 139 , 151 , 154 , 160 ] . to the best of our knowledge due to the important role of hla - g in the regulation of the immune response and its relevant function during the course of pregnancy , the overall structure of the molecule has been maintained during the evolution process , preserving major hla - g binding sites to leukocyte receptors and hla - g dimer formation . on the other hand , several variable sites although a perfunctory analysis of the many variable sites observed in the promoter region of several worldwide populations indicates that some known transcription factor target regions have also been conserved , one can not rule out the influence of the differential action of distinct transcription factors according to promoter region variability . in contrast , most of the variable sites found in the hla - g 3utr might influence hla - g expression by facilitating or hindering microrna binding and/or influencing mrna stability .","hla - g has a relevant role in immune response regulation . 
 the overall structure of the hla - g coding region has been maintained during the evolution process , in which most of its variable sites are synonymous mutations or coincide with introns , preserving major functional hla - g properties . 
 the hla - g promoter region is different from the classical class i promoters , mainly because ( i ) it lacks regulatory responsive elements for ifn- and nf-b , ( ii ) the proximal promoter region ( within 200 bases from the first translated atg ) does not mediate transactivation by the principal hla class i transactivation mechanisms , and ( iii ) the presence of identified alternative regulatory elements ( heat shock , progesterone and hypoxia - responsive elements ) and unidentified responsive elements for il-10 , glucocorticoids , and other transcription factors is evident . 
 at least three variable sites in the 3 untranslated region have been studied that may influence hla - g expression by modifying mrna stability or microrna binding sites , including the 14-base pair insertion / deletion , + 3142c / g and + 3187a / g polymorphisms . 
 other polymorphic sites have been described , but there are no functional studies on them . 
 the hla - g coding region polymorphisms might influence isoform production and at least two null alleles with premature stop codons have been described . 
 we reviewed the structure of the hla - g promoter region and its implication in transcriptional gene control , the structure of the hla - g 3utr and the major actors of the posttranscriptional gene control , and , finally , the presence of regulatory elements in the coding region .",348
"a 3-year - old male , known to have isolated speech delay , presented to the emergency department with severe body aches and inability to walk . few days prior to his presentation , the child started to have flu - like symptoms in the form of rhinorrhea and low - grade fever . this was followed by irritableness , hypoactivity , and inability to move his legs and arms . he was seen in a private hospital where computed tomography of the brain and a lumber puncture were done that showed no abnormalities . in the next day , his condition continued to worsen . he developed difficulty in swallowing and dark - colored urine , so he was transferred to our institution . upon physical examination , the laboratory tests showed elevated creatine kinase level ( 1 778 856 u / l ; normal range 20 - 200 u / l ) , elevated serum transaminases ( serum glutamic - pyruvic transaminase [ sgpt ] = 1857 u / l [ normal range 0 - 50 u / l ] , serum glutamic - oxaloacetic transaminase [ sgot ] = 8626 u / l [ normal range 0 - 50 u / l ] ) , and creatinine 0.72 mg / dl ( 0.3 - 0.7 mg / dl ) . the child started on intravenous hydration and received 1 dose of intravenous immunoglobulin . on the second day , the creatine kinase and serum transaminase levels improved , with creatinine reaching 0.94 mg / dl , the highest level reached . the creatine kinase and serum transaminase levels continued to improve gradually over the following days , with slow improvement in the clinical condition . he received another 2 doses of intravenous immunoglobulin on days 13 and 14 of admission . muscle biopsy showed endomysial inflammatory infiltrates , mostly composed of cd8 and cd4 lymphocytes ; myofibers necrosis mostly ventral portion of myofibers ; residual granular microcalcifications ; and terminal complement complex deposits that outline necrotic myofibers , all features compatible with necrotic myopathy and early rhabdomyolysis ( figure 2 ) . the arrows showed the degenerated myofibers . upon discharge , the child had mild muscle aches , was able to sit , and move his arms and feet . he had persistent weakness in the lower limbs , but was unable to walk , with a follow - up examination 1 month after discharge , revealing that the child was able to walk normally with positive deep tendon reflex . two months after discharge , the creatine kinase level dropped to 193 iu / l . rhabdomyolysis results from skeletal muscle breakdown due to various causes . viral myositis , trauma , and inherited disorders are the most common causes in the pediatric age group . the breakdown releases the normal cell contents into the bloodstream , including creatine kinase , myoglobin , phosphorus , and potassium . rhabdomyolysis is suspected clinically when muscle aches , muscle weakness , and tea - colored urine are present . the diagnosis is based on the high creatine kinase level , which is the most sensitive marker . although there is no established cutoff levels , a concentration 5 to 10 times higher than the upper limit of normal reference range ( ie , 500 - 1000 other laboratory indicators include serum and urine myoglobin concentrations that may be useful but not essential for the diagnosis . the most common complication of rhabdomyolysis is kidney damage . in recent large pediatric studies reported by mannix et al and wu et al , it was shown that the rate of acute renal failure in the pediatric patients with rhabdomyolysis ranged from 5% to 8.7% . the risk factors that predispose a patient with rhabdomyolysis for developing acute renal injury are creatine kinase level concentration more than 5000 u / l , creatine kinase value upon admission , and slower decline in the serum creatine kinase level . other factors include high myoglobin level , persistent or abrupt increase in the potassium or calcium level , as well as persistent metabolic acidosis . on the other hand , a recent study by fernandez et al showed that the most reliable predictor of acute renal failure and the need for dialysis is the creatinine level above 1.7 , despite the peak creatine kinase . the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury is early and aggressive volume resuscitation . other management options include alkalization of the urine , forced diuresis with mannitol , and loop diuretics . in severe cases or in our case , the child developed extremely high creatine kinase levels that were not reported in the literature . a thorough literature review was done searching for high creatine kinase levels in patients with acute rhabdomyolysis . in 2014 , a case report described a pediatric patient with mcardle disease who developed rhabdomyolysis with a high 6-digit creatine kinase level reaching 500 000 2 pediatric cases were reported . in both , the creatine kinase levels reached were 60 000 a case report of an adolescent with rhabdomyolysis due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism was reported with a creatine kinase level that reached around 34 000 a research article in 2013 examined the clinical spectrum of patients with rhabdomyolysis presenting to the pediatric emergency department , in which the peak serum level of creatine kinase was 9825.1  23 079.1 the only risk factor for developing acute renal injury that our patient had was a high peak creatine kinase level upon admission . on the other hand , he did not develop metabolic acidosis and had a normal albumin and electrolytes levels throughout his hospitalization . he responded very well to volume resuscitation with rapid decline in the creatine kinase level . although he received intravenous immunoglobulin for the fear of guillain - barre syndrome or other underlying immune - mediated diseases , neither the creatine kinase level decline nor the clinical status improvement was affected by the intravenous immunoglobulin administration . the sharp decline in the creatine kinase level there are no clues in the family history or the patient s personal history that may suggest an underlying inherited metabolic , muscular , or genetic disease . , this could be the first presentation of lipin-1 mutation that causes recurrent rhabdomyolysis in children . lipin-1 gene encodes the muscle - specific phosphatidic acid phosphatase , a key enzyme in triglyceride and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis . the episodes of rhabdomyolysis are mostly triggered by intercurrent infections and fever and to a lesser extent by fasting or exercise . the prognosis of lipin-1 deficiency is poor , with up to one - third of patients dying during an episode of rhabdomyolysis . in about 60% of patients with recurrent rhabdomyolysis ,","rhabdomyolysis is an acute life - threatening condition that can occur in childhood secondary to many causes . 
 the authors report the case of a 3-year - old male child who presented with acute rhabdomyolysis . 
 the peak plasma creatine kinase level was extremely high . 
 the 2 main causes of rhabdomyolysis in childhood are viral myositis and trauma , which can sometimes lead to acute renal failure . the highest creatine kinase levels reported in the literature so far was a 6-digit level in 2014 case report . in this study , the authors report the case of a 7-digit creatine kinase level in a child secondary to viral myositis who did not require renal dialysis .",152
"gastric cancer is the second most frequent neoplasm of the alimentary tract after the large intestine . 5,103 people in poland were affected by it in 2008 . the case - to - death ratio of around 1 indicates unfavourable prognosis as to recovery from this disease [ 1 , 2 ] . this poor result is determined by the fact that it is rarely ( only in around 8% ) detected in the form of early gastric cancer , in the mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic phase . in most patients it is diagnosed at a higher degree than the 1st degree of disease progression and its classic symptoms are weight loss , continuous and dull pain in the epigastrium , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting and chronic bleeding [ 3 , 4 ] . the existence of gastric cancer metastasis to the ureter has been described twice in the literature to date . a female patient , age 67 , was diagnosed at the district hospital ( 22.04 - 30.04.2010 ) because of intensified symptoms of left - sided renal colic . based on the conducted usg and single - phase computed tomography tests of the abdominal cavity and the pelvis , dilation of the ureter was found because of its infiltration by a pathological focus with the dimensions of 28 mm  15 mm . another lesion was located nearby at the level of the left iliac muscle  30 mm  27 mm  20 mm , adhering to the sigmoid colon . tissue infiltration of the pelvis minor wall was found descending in the direction of the left appendages . colonoscopy was conducted and in this test the large intestine was described without pathology , while the gynaecological usg test confirmed the presence of fluid in the pelvis . during her stay the patient was treated with analgesic and diastolic medication and then referred for further treatment at the regional oncology centre . because of reported pain complaints , she was immediately admitted to the department of oncological surgery on the day of her visit to the outpatient clinic ( 04.05.2010 ) . the urologist consulting the patient indicated the possibility of kidney damage due to ureteral obstruction with recommendation for an accelerated operation . therefore , pre - operative diagnostics were not extended beyond the tests received from the district hospital . the patient underwent surgery on 10.05.2010 and intraoperatively , besides the expected neoplastic tumour of the left ovary with infiltration of the ureter , numerous neoplastic foci were also found : a sigmoid colon tumour , a caecum tumour , a tumour of the body of the stomach and two single tumours in the omentum . because of the resectability of the neoplastic foci described above , the operation plan adopted earlier was changed and the following were performed in succession with palliative intention : partial gastrectomy by the rydygier method , right - sided hemicolectomy , left ovariectomy and sigmoid resection . after restoring the continuity of the alimentary tract , the tumour occluded the lumen , which is why segmental ureterectomy was performed with end - to - end anastomosis over a pigtail catheter . the patient passed the post - operative period without complications , except a two - day fever . because of the expected alimentary tract failure , parenteral nutrition was included on the 1st day after the procedure and blood deficits were supplemented with 2 units of erythrocyte mass and 7 units of plasma . on the 9th day after the operation , the patient was discharged home in a good general condition with recommendations for further treatment . the received postoperative histopathological protocol indicated that the stomach was the origin of the neoplastic process . to lauren ) , type i ( acc . to goseki ) , of a stomach adenocarcinoma with a g2 malignancy degree , with occupation of the whole thickness of the stomach wall , with the following immunohistochemical characteristics : ck7(+++ ) , ck20(++ ) , ca125(+ ) , mucicarmine(+ ) . neoplastic infiltrations along nerves and neoplastic embolisms of blood vessels , as well as metastatic foci in the greater omentum , were observed in the specimen . because of the palliative partial gastrectomy type , only 3 lymph nodes were described in this specimen and all of them contained neoplastic cells . besides the above , histopathological confirmations were obtained of the metastatic character of the foci in the ovary , caecum and sigmoid colon . the cancer occupied large and small intestine walls without infiltration of the mucous membrane and the immunohistochemical characteristics were identical as for the primary lesion . according to the above protocol , excision within tissues with a healthy margin of these organs was achieved . the widening of the left ureter is visible ( marked by arrow ) focus of metastatic carcinoma in the ureter wall . microscopic section , he staining , magnification 40 neoplastic invasion in the ureter wall . microscopic section , he staining , magnification 100 it is interesting biologically and constitutes the basis for this paper that the ureteral tumour was described by the pathologists not as a neoplastic infiltration encroaching on the ureter , but as a metastatic focus to the ureteral wall . after the operative treatment , the patient was qualified for palliative chemotherapy and received it from 28.07.2010 . the first treatment course was according to the eox regimen ( oxaliplatin and capecitabine ) , but because of the occurrence of neutropenic fever the regimen was changed to pf ( cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil ) . she again received only one course and the treatment was changed once more because newly formed metastatic foci in the liver were located in imaging tests . next , three chemotherapy courses were administered according to the folfiri regimen ( irinotecan , leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil ) , but only until 11.11.2010 because due to progression of changes in the liver described in examinations the chemotherapy was discontinued and the patient was qualified for symptomatic treatment . according to our knowledge treatment of gastric cancer in the disseminated phase of the disease aims at extension of life and achieving a good palliative effect . the recommended methods , allowing the above to be achieved , are chemotherapy or combination radiochemotherapy . in an advanced stage , palliative operations on this organ are performed for life reasons and serve to eliminate complications such as bleeding , perforation or obstruction of the organ . it is indicated that the above complications forced surgical intervention in 1/4 of the patients previously disqualified from operative treatment because of the presence of metastatic foci . according to literature data , patients operated on by palliative resection in the disseminated phase of the disease achieve a survival time of between 9 and 15 months . the survival time is limited by the number of metastatic foci ; when their number is higher than two foci , no statistically significant differences are observed in this scope . the value of these procedures is increasing because of the reported low perioperative mortality and the observed significant improvement in the further quality of life for these patients [ 513 ] . it seems that the operative procedure conducted in the presented patient allowed a good palliative effect to be achieved along with loss of severe colic and maintenance of kidney function . the literature often presents , as characteristic of gastric cancer , blood - borne metastasis to the ovary , termed a krukenberg tumour . this is a term generally defining metastasis to the ovary , mainly gastric cancer and next colon cancer . metastases from other organs , such as the lungs , the mammary gland and the uterus , are also possible , though much rarer . krukenberg tumours are encountered in the course of 2 - 4% of disseminated neoplastic processes . this is a negative prognostic factor , with varying median survival time after its diagnosis : 12 - 13 months in the course of gastric cancer compared to 17 - 29 months in the course of large intestine cancer . this undoubtedly results from biological differences in the course of these neoplasms [ 1423 ] . in summary , the available literature sources have described this only twice to date ( in 1976 and 2000 ) . however , nephroureterectomy was conducted in these quoted cases [ 24 , 25 ] . in the presented patient the kidney was spared and healing of the ureter after end - to - end suture was achieved . the dissemination of a neoplasm with extremely rarely encountered symptomatology described above is an interesting experience which we wanted to share . the beginning of the symptomatic disease as a left - sided renal colic is , in itself , a previously unreported case .","the typical symptoms of advanced cancer of the stomach are well known in clinical practice . 
 the presented case concerns a patient with symptoms of left - sided renal colic , caused by a malignant tumour involving the ureter , which was diagnosed with a ct scan . 
 the multifocal process , involving the stomach , two parts of the colon , the left ovary and the side of the pelvis , was confirmed only during surgery.the resection or partial resection of the above - mentioned organs involved by the malignant process and reconstruction of the alimentary tract as well as the ureter were performed at time of this operation . 
 the patient 's recovery was without any complications . 
 the histopathological findings support the diagnosis of this malignant process as disseminated stomach cancer.in the available literature only two cases of stomach cancer metastasis to the ureter have been described . in both cited examples resection of the ureter with nephrectomy was performed . 
 the review of the literature supports the value of stomach palliative resection in prolonging life and improving quality of life .",213
"the world health organization ( who ) considers lymphatic filariasis ( lf ) the second leading cause of physical disability worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] . of the 1.4 billion people who lives in filaria endemic areas in the 73 endemic countries , 120 million people are currently infected . globally , there are 15 million people with lymphoedema and 25 million men with urogenital swelling , principally scrotal hydrocele . the chronic attacks in the form of acute filarial adenolymphangitis caused by the death of adult filarial worms and acute dermatolymphangioadenitis ( adla ) due to secondary infection are common in lymphoedema . repeated acute episodes spur the progression from lymphoedema to elephantiasis and have greater short term disability . a regimen of rigorous foot care practices with skin hygiene and simple self - help measures , such as limb elevation , exercise , use of topical antibiotics , and antifungals , aimed at minimizing episodes of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis ( adla ) attacks and lymph stasis is the model recommended by the world health organization for the management of filarial lymphoedema [ 6 , 7 ] . people with higher grades of lymphoedema and hydrocele had more severe psychosocial problems than physical ones . they are at higher risk of depression . a study from sri lanka reported individuals suffering from chronic lymphoedema were depressed ( 8.5% ) , felt shy ( 33.3% ) , had fear of lymphoedema ( 7.3% ) , and perceived a major problem affecting their lives ( 61.8% ) . the disease is prevalent in the rural areas of the country predominantly affecting the poorer sector of the community . the gravity of the problem lies in 60 out of 75 districts being endemic and more than 25 million individuals are at risk . prevalence rates above 20% were found in 11 districts ( with the highest rate of 40% ) , those of 619% were found in 15 districts , and 0.15% were in 7 districts . the government of nepal is committed to eliminating lf by 2020   initiating the mass drug administration ( mda ) in the parsa district in 2003 , which was later expanded to 46 districts in 2011 . this programme is focused on interrupting parasite transmission by employing annual , community - wide mass drug administration [ 13 , 14 ] . information and insights on health seeking behaviors and self - care practices of lymphoedema in nepal remain meager . the objective of this qualitative paper is to explore specific health beliefs , health - seeking behaviors , and self - care practices of people with lymphoedema in nepal for designing socially acceptable and culturally compatible prevention and morbidity management strategies . an exploratory study was carried out in the three of sixty lf endemic districts in nepal from july to september , 2013 . the selected districts were dhading ( salyantar village development committee ( vdc ) ) , kapilvastu ( maharajgunj vdc ) , and kailali ( pahalbanpur and malakheti vdcs ) . this study is a part of the larger study conducted on  parasitological and sociocultural aspects of lymphatic filariasis in nepal . the cases of lymphoedema were mapped with the help of female community health volunteers and health workers in the study sites . a semistructured interview schedule was prepared after considering previous studies as works of references [ 1517 ] and authors ' experiences in the field . the developed tool was then reviewed by a panel of experts from the department of community medicine and public health at the institute of medicine , kathmandu , nepal . questions were translated into nepali , pretested on a sample of lymphoedema patients in the salyantar vdc of the dhading district , and later modified to correspond to the cultural setting of the study site . qualitative study techniques were used [ 18 , 19 ] . in - depth interviews ( idis ) were conducted by research assistants who spoke the local language fluently . at the end of the interview , all patients were also educated on lymphoedema management practices recommended by the world health organization . each interview lasted 4560 minutes and was tape recorded and later translated into english . over 200 pages of typed verbatim transcripts data were systematically examined for emerging codes and patterns and were divided into a priori themes : health beliefs , health seeking behaviors , and self - care practices for data analysis . this was followed by indexing , charting , mapping , and interpretation ( figure 1 ) . this study obtained ethical clearance from the institutional review board at the institute of medicine , tribhuvan university , nepal . this word is used to signify someone who has swollen legs that resemble the legs of an elephant . while  hattipaile  was the most commonly used word in dhading and kailali districts ,  godfuluwa  was used in awadhi - speaking communities in kapilvastu . we did not find any local terminology used to signify lymphoedema of hands in kapilvastu and kailai districts . however , in the dhading district , people used  hatfuluwa  and compound terminologies like  hatma hattipaile bhako  . knobs , lesions , and skin folds in the body , right leg swelling , left leg swelling , swelling of both the legs , and swelling of single or both arms were the major signs found . hydrocele was found to be a well - known condition and a major health problem in the study communities . patients and other key informants were asked what they believed to be the cause of lymphoedema . respondents reported that the cause of disease was related to their past work and physical activity , insect / mosquito bites , and bodily abnormality . although people say that the mosquito bite causes it , i believe it is due to the defect of my internal body . i also suffer from fever , swelling and tingling of nerves and once i got unconscious for 2 - 3 days due to a high grade fever . although people say that the mosquito bite causes it , i believe it is due to the defect of my internal body . i also suffer from fever , swelling and tingling of nerves and once i got unconscious for 2 - 3 days due to a high grade fever . others associated diseases with itching , wounds and infection , massage / contact , inheritance , excessive sexual activity ,  dirty blood ,  trauma , trapped gas , and witchcraft were reported by respondents to be the causes of lymphoedema . a few of the respondents reported that prevention could be achieved by taking diethyl carbamazine ( dec ) , using a mosquito - nets and chemical spray . i get a fever and swelling which becomes worse during the cold . respondents were asked what kind of services they had taken for the treatment of lymphoedema . most of the respondents said that they used traditional and home - based care in the first episodes of lymphoedema . faith / beliefs such as dhami / jhakri , avoidance of food , astrologists and pandits , and home - based treatments such as hot water and sponging had been used . a man who had sought care from traditional healers said ,   for treatment , at first i approached dhami / jhakri and even performed naag puja ( a hindu ritual worshipping snake god ) . later i went to amppipal hospital ( local hospital ) where lymphoedema was diagnosed . following this , i took medicine but did not get cured .    for treatment , at first i approached dhami / jhakri and even performed naag puja ( a hindu ritual worshipping snake god ) . later i went to amppipal hospital ( local hospital ) where lymphoedema was diagnosed . following this traditional medical remedies such as applying neem ( azadirachta indica ) leaves and leeches over the swollen area were reported . i preferred home remedies and , therefore , took garlic and cow urine followed by hot sponging but nothing cured me . i preferred home remedies and , therefore , took garlic and cow urine followed by hot sponging but nothing cured me . most of the respondents mentioned that they had frequently used the analgesics , dec , diuretics , nsaids , vitamins tablets , antifungal creams , antibacterial creams , and antibiotics bought from medical shops on prescription from health practitioners . there were many hydrocele patients aspiring to the treatment for hydrocele but actually did not have hydrocelectomy . however , most pricked the hydrocele with sharp objects to drain out the fluid . the high cost of surgery and lack of money and fear of death , as well as impotence and/or sterility , were reported as the reasons why they did not have hydrocelectomy . i went to delhi ( india ) where lymphoedema was diagnosed and i took medicine , but still i am not cured . now , i do n't have money for operation ( hydrocelectomy ) . i went to delhi ( india ) where lymphoedema was diagnosed and i took medicine , but still i am not cured . respondents reported various psychological problems such as anxiety , worry and stress , depression , low self - esteem , feeling weak , and fear of being abandoned . i am afraid that my husband will leave me to marry other women  .   due to this disease , i got married to a poor family females were worried more about transmitting the disease to children compared to their counter parts . more males reported painful sexual intercourse and psychological problems . however , none had taken treatment or counseling for the management of the problem . a man having a lymphoedema in legs and only a quarter of the study population was aware and a few of them had been practicing standard foot care practices like soap water washing , elevation and exercise of the affected limb , nail hygiene , trauma reduction and care for the entry lesion , antiseptics , and use of footwear on a regular basis . the majority of the respondents had been practicing washing the affected limbs only . among the six foot care measures asked , they did not have knowledge of foot care practices ; patients said when asked about why they did not practice such practices . application of medicinal bandages , herbal preparations , and leeches on the swollen area was reported . in rare cases , patients used herbal preparations orally , or smeared them on affected parts , or those preparations were given as an enema , and even scarification of affected parts was reported . respondents reported that they were able to wear clothes , walk , and bathe , but had a feeding problem , had trouble in doing agricultural work , and had difficulty in using a toilet and difficulty in brushing their teeth . i am able to use a toilet , wear clothes , take a bath and take care of my body . i am able to use a toilet , wear clothes , take a bath and take care of my body . however , many said that they were not assisted by family member in feeding , using toilet , and wearing clothes . although i can do my personal hygiene , i have trouble in going to the toilet . sometimes due to swelling , i ca n't even do my daily chores but as i have no one in the family to assist me , i have to do them anyway with pain  . although i can do my personal hygiene , i have trouble in going to the toilet . sometimes due to swelling , i ca n't even do my daily chores but as i have no one in the family to assist me , i have to do them anyway with pain  . some respondents said that they abstained from certain types of foods such as tea , sour items , onion , brinjal , kuvindo ( vegetable ) , salt , fish , and yoghurt . this study was conducted in a small geographic area with diverse ethnic population in each district . the identified terminologies can be used to develop information , education , and communication ( iec ) materials that are locally appropriate . the majority of the respondents did not believe that the parasite in the body due to mosquito bites is the real cause of the disease . quite the opposite , they attributed the disease to their past work and physical activity . study conducted in south india reported that only 9% of people having lf and 20% of those without the disease knew that filariasis is caused through mosquito bites ; the rest attributed it to many other causes . similarly around 42% of people during the pre - mda period had accurate knowledge of the association of lf with mosquito bites . in general , people did not accept the mosquito theory of transmission , but they believed in other physical , spiritual , and hereditary causes . the current study showed that only a few knew about the preventive measures against the disease . about 83% of the affected and 87% of the unaffected individuals either were uncertain or felt that filariasis is not preventable . krentel et al . reported that the knowledge of the cause of the disease and its prevention is important for compliance with mass drug administration . hence awareness activities during mass drug administration campaigns need to be emphasized for disseminating messages related to the cause and prevention of lymphoedema . lymphoedema is debilitating in humans ; it has several manifestations , including lymphoedema and hydrocele . the study participants had swelling of the legs and the hands and some even presented with knobs , lesions , and skin folds in the body . a study conducted in ghana found that the most common illnesses in the study communities were joint pains , lymphoedema , stomach pains , hernia : hydrocele , measles , malaria : fever , headache , dizziness , eye problems , diarrhoea , adl attacks , and waist pains . the greater the degree of lymphoedema , the lesser the quality of life they have . the morbidity management is one of the objectives of the national lf elimination program in nepal ; there are no activities run at community level to provide treatment , care , and support for people with lymphoedema . we found that the majority of the respondents visited traditional faith healers prior to their seeking modern medicine . ayurveda , homeopathy , unani , and amchi are the major alternative medicines that have long been practiced in nepal . also , the ayurvedic treatment was also practised for lymphoedema management ( 25% ) followed by home remedies and acupuncture in sri lanka . they are the first point of contact of care in rural areas of the country . there are public health programs on reproductive health and child morbidity to train the traditional faith healers to refer patients coming to them to the health centers . therefore , trainings should be provided for alternative medicine providers so that they can provide counseling to manage lymphoedema and refer the cases to health centers . self - care for the disease reduces health care utilization and potentially yields monetary benefits to a health plan . in conformity with an earlier study in india , washing affected limbs was common among the respondents , though it can not be linked to lymphoedema care , as washing hands and feet is common in the hindu rituals . respondents were not wearing larger size footwear and none of them reported massaging the affected limbs . a regular footwear might not prevent the individuals from external injuries ; therefore , a larger size footwear should be recommended . massaging affected limbs relieves pain and an elevation exercise prevents accumulation of fluids in affected limbs . both should be recommended . standard foot care practices can be incorporated into routine counseling services in health centers in endemic communities . engaging in self - care as part of daily disease management is crucial in villages in nepal on account of villagers ' poor access to health centers . lymphoedema cases might have difficulty in traveling to health centers for their treatment because in most of the cases , the health centers are more than thirty minutes ' walk from their place of residence . thus , home - based management with a greater emphasis placed on foot care aimed at lymphoedema patients needs to be promoted . it is found that hydrocoele was the commonest manifestation among the lf cases in this study . in line with a study from ghana , most of the hydrocoele patients mentioned that the main reasons for refusing hydrocelectomy were the high cost of surgery and lack of money and to some extent fear of death and impotence and/or sterility that might result from the operation . just as the previous studies reported , food taboos like refraining from taking certain foods and drinks , tea , sour items , onion , brinjal , kuvindo ( vegetable ) , salt , fish , and yoghurt were reported . abstinence reduces the supply of nutrients and minerals in the body , possibly leading to poor health . psychological problems reported by the respondents in this study are in strong agreement with those in previous studies . a review literature reported fear , anxiety , frustration , and distress   in people with lymphoedema . in our study population , illiteracy , lack of treatment , and poor or no counseling might be the causes of the reported cases having fear of transmitting disease to their children . while it was found that the respondents had some psychological conditions , the importance of social participation by those who have this condition needs to be emphasized more by peripheral health workers in nepal . previous studies reported that the role of social participation is important in rehabilitation and reduction of psychological trauma and problems . this study is perhaps the first of its kind to report health - seeking behaviors and self - care practices of people living with filarial lymphoedema in nepal . subjects with mild and moderate forms of filarial lymphoedema might not have been studied well in this study , for they did not participate for reasons , such as in part the hidden nature of the disease and in part our inability to indentify them . the health - seeking behavior and self - care practices reported in this study might not represent all of the practices across the diverse topography and people in nepal . lymphoedema in the limbs and hydrocele were found to be major health problems in the studied communities . the majority of the respondents did not believe that the parasite in the body due to mosquito bites is the real cause of the disease . the traditional health care providers were the first contact of care for the majority of respondents . active programmes for surgical management lymphoedema and standard foot care practices should be emphasized in lymphatic filariasis elimination programme by involving government bodies , ngos , and other community based organizations .","background . 
 lymphatic filariasis is endemic in nepal . this study aimed to investigate health - seeking behaviors and self - care practices of people with filarial lymphoedema in nepal 
 . methods . 
 a cross - sectional study was conducted using qualitative methods in three endemic districts . 
 twenty - three patients with current lymphoedema were recruited in the study . 
 results . 
 hydrocele was found to be a well - known condition and a major health problem in the studied communities . 
 people with lymphoedema primarily sought health care from traditional healers , whereas sometimes home - based care was their first treatment . 
 later ayurvedic and allopathic hospital - based care were sought . 
 respondents reported various psychological problems such as difficulty in engaging in sexual intercourse , anxiety , worry and stress , depression , low self - esteem , feeling weak , fear of being abandoned , and fear of transmitting disease to the children . 
 standard foot care practices except washing were largely absent . 
 conclusions . 
 lymphoedema in the limbs and hydrocele were found to be major health problems . 
 the traditional health care providers were the first contact of care for the majority of respondents . 
 only a few patients had been practicing standard foot care practices .",253
"this causes misalignment between the sleep and wake propensities that are controlled by hypothalamic circadian pacemaker   and results into shift work sleep disorder ( swsd ) . the reported incidence of swsd in india is about 44.8% of night - shift workers and 35.8% of rotating workers . swsd is characterized by persistent excessive sleepiness during night work and insomnia when attempting sleep in the daytime . individuals with swsd have significantly higher incidence of sleepiness - related accidents , absenteeism , depression , and missed family and social activities as compared with other night - shift workers . it is also associated with higher incidence of ulcers , cardiovascular disease , and deficit in cognition and psychomotor performance [ 4 , 5 ] . the pharmacological management of swsd involves treatment with modafinil that has been shown to improve wakefulness and ability to sustain attention in these patients . however , despite the half - life of 15 hours , the wakefulness promoting effect of modafinil is found to be ill - sustained in the last one third of night shift hours . the lack of efficacy in the early morning hours and undue patient confidence in the drug can result into excessive sleepiness while commuting home . armodafinil , the chirally pure r - enantiomer of modafinil , approved by us fda in 2007 has half - life ( t1/2 = 15 hours ) three times longer than its s - enantiomer ( t1/2 = 3 hours ) . despite the same half lives , comparison of the equivalent ( 200  mg ) doses of modafinil and armodafinil , in humans has revealed that armodafinil sustains higher plasma concentrations 614  hrs postadministration than that of racemic modafinil with longer maintenance of wakefulness [ 810 ] . this was a randomized , comparative , double - blind , and multicentric study comparing the effects of modafinil 200  mg with armodafinil 150  mg in indian patients of swsd . prior approval was obtained from drug controller general of india ( dcgi ) and appropriate ethics committees . the study was conducted in accordance of good clinical practice guidelines ( issued by central drugs standard control organization , government of india ) and according to the declaration of helsinki . the trial was registered at the clinical trials registry , india ( http://www.ctri.in/ ) . after obtaining written informed consent , patients of either sex , aged between 18 and 60 years , attending outpatient clinics of the authors , and suffering from excessive sleepiness associated with swsd ( assessed basis patient ' primary complaint and using the diagnostic criteria adopted from international classification for sleep disorders   ( table 1 ) ) were enrolled . patients were working at least five night shifts every month for 12 hours or less , with 6 hours or more working between 10  p.m. and 8  a.m. and at least three shifts occurring consecutively . the major exclusion criteria were patients with significant liver or kidney or heart diseases , patients with clinically significant , uncontrolled psychiatric or medical condition , patients with known history of hypersensitivity to formulation , patients operating an automobile or hazardous machinery , caffeine consumption averaging more than 600  mg / day within 1 week of baseline , use of other concomitant medications which inhibit , induce , or are metabolized by cyp450 , patients using sedative or cns acting drugs or medication liable to affect outcome of the study ( e.g. , antihistamines , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants , lithium , anti - psychotics , anticonvulsants , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , benzodiazepines , psychostimulants , and anticoagulants ) , pregnant and lactating mothers , females of reproductive age and expecting   pregnancy or using steroidal contraception , and patients with alcohol or drug abuse . this was a multi - centric , randomized , comparative , and double - blind parallel group , clinical trial conducted over 18 sites across india . 1 ratio for test and reference products online at http://www.randomization.com/. patients received orally either armodafinil 150  mg tablet ( emcure pharmaceuticals ltd . , india ) or modafinil 200  mg tablet ( from commercial source ) one hour prior to start of every night shift for 12 weeks . the test formulation was earlier found to be bioequivalent to the us fda - approved formulation of armodafinil , in 26 healthy indian volunteers . the tablets of armodafinil and modafinil were identical in shape , size , and color and were dispensed in coded , identical , and opaque packs to conceal identity and maintain blinding . patients were evaluated for sleepiness score based on stanford sleepiness scale ( sss ) at baseline , 4 weeks , 8 weeks , and 12 weeks . all the assessments were done in the morning hours at the end of three consecutive night shifts . the primary efficacy endpoint was proportion of patients showing at least 2 grades of improvement ( responder ) based on sss in both groups . the other efficacy variables included improvement in mean sss grades compared to baseline , compliance to therapy , and patients ' as well as physicians ' global assessment for efficacy . global assessment of efficacy was performed using the following grades : ( i ) excellent = reduction of > 75% of symptoms , ( ii ) good = reduction of 5175% of symptoms , ( iii ) fair = reduction of 2650% of symptoms , and ( iv ) poor = no improvement or reduction in < 25% of symptoms . patients ' compliance to the therapy was calculated in percentage by using following formula : ( number of tablets actually taken 100)/number of tablets supposed to be taken . a general and detailed systemic examination was performed for all patients during each study visit . blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the study for complete hemograms , liver function tests , renal function tests , lipid profile , and fasting blood glucose levels . electrocardiograms were performed for all patients at baseline and at the end of the study . tolerability was assessed by recording patients ' global assessment about the tolerability of the drug and percent of the patients experiencing any drug - related adverse events . the global assessment of tolerability was performed using following grades : ( i ) excellent = no adverse drug reaction , ( ii ) good = mild adverse drug reaction but no interference with normal lifestyle , ( iii ) fair = mild adverse drug reaction which interference with normal lifestyle . however , benefits of drug therapy outweigh the inconvenience , ( iv ) poor = drug withdrawn . prestudy calculations showed that a sample size of 100 in each group would have 80% power to detect a difference of at least 19% in responder rate with a significance level ( alpha ) of.05 ( two tailed ) . was done by comparing the proportion of patients showing excellent and good response against proportion of patients showing fair and poor response . for all statistical tests , a p value of less than or equal to 0.05 was considered as significant , after correction for any multiple comparisons . two hundred and eleven patients of swsd were recruited with 105 subjects in armodafinil group and 106 subjects in the modafinil group ( figure 1 ) . both modafinil and armodafinil significantly improved sleepiness grades as compared to baseline ( p < .0001 ) ( figure 2 ) . responder rates with armodafinil ( 72.12% ) and modafinil ( 74.29% ) were comparable ( p = .76 ) . at the end of therapy , compliance in both modafinil group ( 99.31%  3.06% ) and armodafinil group ( 99.13%  2.35% ) was found to be good and comparable ( p = .63 ) indicating adequate patient adherence to therapy . both physicians ' and patients ' assessment of efficacy was found to be comparable between armodafinil and modafinil group ( figure 3 ) . the intention - to - treat analysis showed that the adverse event incidences in modafinil ( 40.57% ) and armodafinil ( 42.87% ) groups were similar ( p = .78 ) . the adverse effect profile of both drugs was found to be similar with headache , nausea , and dry mouth being the common adverse effects ( table 3 ) . no incidences of accidents or absenteeism from work were noted during the study period as assessed from patient history . physicians ' and patients ' assessment of tolerability was found to be comparable between armodafinil and modafinil group ( figure 4 ) . the baseline and after - therapy biochemical values were within normal range and similar between two groups , except that there was slight increase in mean sgpt in both armodafinil and modafinil groups as compared to baseline ( p = .008 and  .0007 ) without inter - group significance and mean blood urea value in armodafinil group increased ( p = .002 ) compared to baseline . however , the increased values were within normal limits . in both groups , electrocardiograms were within normal at baseline and after completion of therapy in all patients . the adverse events that led to discontinuation were palpitation , anxiety , hypertension , depression , nervousness , and depressed mood in a patient receiving armodafinil and vomiting along with dizziness in another patient receiving modafinil . the present study confirms the efficacy of armodafinil 150  mg in patients of swsd . the efficacy of armodafinil was found to be comparable to 200  mg of modafinil in maintaining wakefulness . both modafinil and armodafinil caused a slight increase in liver enzymes , and armodafinil caused a slight increase in blood urea nitrogen . this was not of clinical significance as the increased values were within normal laboratory limits . armodafinil 150  mg was comparable to modafinil 200  mg , which indicates that armodafinil is 1.33 time more potent than racemic modafinil . the use of r - enantiomer of modafinil avoids unnecessary use of s - isomer and exerts less metabolic load on the body .   in previous studies , 200  mg of armodafinil was shown to provide more sustained plasma concentrations late in the day as compared to 200  mg of modafinil and monophasic plasma elimination kinetics as compared biphasic for modafinil . we chose the 150  mg dose of armodafinil , as this was the approved dosage for the present indication . our study demonstrated no difference in the efficacy of 150  mg of armodafinil over 200  mg of modafinil . the comparative efficacy of 200  mg of armodafinil with modafinil in swsd has not yet been assessed . a limitation of the present study is that the assessment of sleep latency and polysomnography throughout the nightshift could not be done due to unavailability of patients and investigators . the study did not demonstrate any difference in efficacy and safety between armodafinil 150  mg   and   modafinil 200  mg , and both drugs were comparable .","aim . to compare the efficacy and safety of armodafinil , the r - enantiomer of modafinil , with modafinil in patients of shift work sleep disorder ( swsd ) .

"members of the burkholderia cepacia complex ( bcc ) are gram - negative bacteria of the -proteobacteria subdivision and include plant , animal , and human pathogens , with a widespread distribution in natural and man - made inhabitats . these bacteria exhibit an extraordinary metabolic versatility , allowing their adaptation to a wide range of environments . among the bcc bacteria , several strains of potential environmental application have been identified due to their ability to degrade pollutants in water and soils ( e.g. , crude oils , herbicides , recalcitrant aromatic compounds , and xenobiotics ) . a summary of burkholderia strains capable of degrading recalcitrant xenobiotics is available at the biodegradative strain database ( http://bsd.cme.msu.edu/ ) . several bcc strains are also able to produce antifungal compounds and to fix atmospheric nitrogen . recent evidence suggests that members of the burkholderia genus are ancient nitrogen - fixing symbionts of mimosa legumes particularly adapted to acidic infertile soils . due to the ability of some strains to promote plant growth , bacteria of the bcc have attracted significant commercial interest as biocontrol , bioremediation , and plant - growth promoting agents , mainly due to their ability to colonize the rhizosphere of several crops of economical interest , like corn , maize , rice , pea , and sunflower . however , these bacteria have also emerged as important human pathogens and the risks associated with the agricultural uses of bcc strains remain unclear . there is a general consensus that the large - scale use of organisms of the burkholderia genus is imprudent until more is known about the fate of biocontrol strains after their release in the environment . the pathogenic mechanisms and traits used by these bacteria , the clinical outcomes of infected patients , and the interaction of the introduced biocontrol strains with environmental and clinical strains need further studies . presently , there is some evidence that the environment can be a reservoir for the acquisition of novel bcc infections . for example , the epidemic b. cenocepacia strain phdc was recovered both from patients suffering from cystic fibrosis ( cf ) in the mid - atlantic region of usa , as well as from agricultural soils . in the last 30 years , several epidemiological , taxonomic , and molecular biology studies of bcc strains have been carried out by research groups worldwide , mainly due to the ability of these strains to cause chronic infections among cf patients . the disease results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( cftr ) , a camp - dependent chloride channel , mainly expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells . the genetic defect results in multiple organ system impairment , being the respiratory tract the most affected . chronic pulmonary infections , although caused by a limited number of bacterial species ( e.g. , pseudomonas aeruginosa , bcc , staphylococcus aureus , haemophilus influenza , and stenotrophomonas maltophilia ) , remain the leading cause of death of these patients . the large majority of respiratory infections among cf patients are due to p. aeruginosa strains . compared to this major pathogen , however , bcc infections are particularly feared by cf patients and their caregivers since the clinical outcome is highly variable and unpredictable , ranging from asymptomatic carriage to the cepacia syndrome . additionally , in the vast majority of cf patients , pulmonary colonization with bcc is associated with a worst prognosis , including an accelerated decline of the patients ' clinical status and an increased risk of death . bcc bacteria are also important pathogens in other compromised patients , as is the case of patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease ( cgd ) . cgd is a rare hereditary disease that is caused by mutations in the subunits of the nadph oxidase complex of the phagocytes , resulting in their inability to produce reactive oxygen species . invasive bcc infections and pneumonia is the second leading cause of death of cgd patients . there are also some reports of bcc infections in immunocompromised patients such as cancer and hiv patients , and also among immunocompetent individuals [ 8 , 9 ] . in immunocompetent individuals , bcc strains have been isolated in cases of chronic suppurative otitis media , pharyngeal infections , and paediatric neck infections . in recent years , an increasing number of bacteraemia cases caused by bcc among non - cf hospitalized patients have been reported . most of these patients have comorbidities such as chronic hemodialysis , diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , and malignancy . among these hospitalized non - cf patients , hemodialysis , permanence in intensive care units , use of central venous catheters , indwelling urinary catheters , and endotracheal tubes are now recognized as risk factors contributing for bcc acquisition . the accumulating reports of nosocomial outbreaks caused by bcc led to the recognition of these bacteria as emergent nosocomial pathogens among non - cf patients , in particular among oncology patients . the bcc comprises at least seventeen distinct species , genetically distinct but phenotypically similar [ 10 , 11 ] ( table 1 ) . strains from all the bcc species have been isolated from cf patients and from the environment , however , their frequency of isolation is uneven . while the majority of the isolates obtained from cf patients belong to the species b. cenocepacia and b. multivorans , the majority of the enviromental isolates belong to the species b. cepacia , b. ambifaria , b. cenocepacia , and b. pyrrocinia .   a considerable phenotypic variability has been found for all the bcc species , even within sequential clinical isolates of the same strain . this phenotypic variability difficults the correct identification of bcc strains by diagnostic microbiology laboratories . several phenotypic and genetic methods have been used for the identification of bcc species , including whole - cell protein profile , fatty acid analysis , and 16s rrna and reca gene restriction and sequencing analysis . however , the genetic methods have proven to be the most effective for the correct identification of bcc strains . nowadays , the multilocus sequence typing scheme ( mlst ) is considered the golden standard method for the identification of bcc species . mlst analysis compares the nucleotide sequence of seven house - keeping genes of bcc and the information obtained for each strain sequence type ( st ) is stored in a public database ( http://pubmlst.org/bcc/ ) , thus allowing its use worlwide . recently , this method was redesigned in a nested - pcr mlst format that can be used for the accurate identification of bcc strains directly from sputum samples . this approach allowed the identification of bcc strains in 23 sputum samples obtained from 17 cf patients , of which 8 samples where culture was negative . in addition , the performance of mlst directly with sputum samples also allowed the identification of bcc strains from cf patients with mixed bcc infections or co - infected with p. aeruginosa strains , without the need for strain isolation . bcc bacteria emerged as important cf pathogens during the 1980s , when some infected patients exhibited a rapid clinical deterioration due to necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis , resulting in early death . this fatal decline in the patient 's clinical condition became known as the cepacia syndrome and was not observed for patients infected with any of the other cf pathogens . the key determinants associated with the cepacia syndrome are not completely understood , and both bacterial and host factors are thought to play important roles in determining this dramatic clinical outcome [ 23 , 24 ] . several strains of the species b. multivorans , b. cenocepacia , b. cepacia , and b. dolosa have been shown to be highly transmissible among cf patients through social contact [ 25 , 26 ] . in particular , highly epidemic lineages of the b. cenocepacia species have been described , including the electrophoretic type 12 ( et12 ) , the philadelphia - district of columbia ( phdc ) , and the midwest epidemic lineages [ 27 , 28 ] . these epidemic strains can have an international impact , as is the case of the highly transmissible et12 lineage . this epidemic lineage spread among individuals with cf from canada , uk , and other european countries , being able to replace b. multivorans and causing a high mortality due to its ability to cause the cepacia syndrome [ 14 , 23 , 29 ] . due to the easy transmission of highly virulent strains among cf patients , segregation measures of bcc - infected patients have been successfully implemented and led to the reduction of the transmission of bcc strains . the prevalence of bcc species varies geographically , being b. cenocepacia the most predominant species in cf centers in north america , while b. multivorans is the most common species in european cf centers . for instance , in the major portuguese cf centre , b. cepacia is the most prevalent bcc species . in addition , an outbreak of b. cepacia was reported and associated with the use of nonsterile saline solutions for nasal application . bcc outbreaks among non - cf populations , mainly due to strains of the species b. cenocepacia , b. cepacia , and b. multivorans are also well documented . accumulating evidence points out contaminated pharmaceuticals , cosmetics , disinfectants , and preservative products as major sources of bcc bacteria [ 9 , 34 ] . this is due to their ability to survive in these products . in hospital settings , these pathogens have been recovered from tap and distilled water , dialysis machines , nebulisers , catheters , blood gas analysers , thermometers , ventilator temperature sensors , solutions , and intravenous fluids . one of the major problems associated with bcc infection is their intrinsic resistance to most of the clinically available antimicrobials , including aminoglycosides , quinolones , polymyxins , and -lactams . the multiresistance of bcc bacteria appears to result from various efflux pumps that efficiently remove antibiotics from the cell , decreased contact of antibiotics with the bacterial cell surface due to their ability to form biofilms , and changes in the cell envelope that reduce the permeability of the membrane to the antibiotic . bcc bacteria are also resistant to neutrophil - mediated non - oxidative killing and to the antimicrobial peptides produced by airway epithelial cells , including lysozyme , lactoferrin , and phospholipase a2 . therefore , cf patients chronically infected with bcc are difficult to treat and , although current treatment strategies use double or triple antibiotic combinations to achieve bactericidal activity , they rarely result in the eradication of the pathogen , particularly in the case of chronic infection . in 2003 , the wellcome trust sanger institute sequenced the first genome of a bcc strain . the strain chosen was the type strain of the et12 epidemic lineage , the b. cenocepacia strain j2315 ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/b_cenocepacia/ ) . presently , the genomic sequences of 18 strains from 7  bcc species are publicly available ( http://pathema.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/burkholderia/pathemahomepage.cgi ) . the genomes of bcc bacteria are organized in three circular chromosomal replicons and one to five megaplasmids , ranging from 6.2 to 8.7  mbp in size , with a gc content of about 67% . the large size and repartition of the genomes of bcc is thought to increase their flexibility to acquire and lose genes . in a recent bioinformatics study , ( 2010 ) suggested that the genes located in secondary chromosomes exhibit a weaker codon usage bias than those located in primary chromosomes , being subject to a faster evolutionary rate . several evidences point out that more than 10% of the bcc genomes have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer , contributing to the genomic plasticity and metabolic diversity of these bacteria . for example , in the case of the b. cenocepacia strain j2315 , 14 genomic islands , most probably arisen from horizontal gene transfer , have been identified based on their distinct gc content percentage . the acquisition of genomic islands appears to play a crucial role in the evolution of this particular epidemic lineage , introducing new functions that promoted survival and pathogenesis in the cf lung . this is the case of the 31.7  kb cci pathogenicity island , which appears to be unique to b. cenocepacia strains . this pathogenicity island encodes both virulence and metabolism - associated genes , including the cciir quorum sensing system , a fatty acid biosynthesis operon , transcriptional regulators , and genes involved in the metabolism of amino acids . in addition , the genome of b. cenocepacia j2315 contains 79 insertion sequence ( is ) elements that are most probably involved in genomic rearrangements , replicon fusion , activation / silencing of gene expression , mobilization of dna , and recruitment of foreign genes . another feature of the genomes of bcc bacteria is the presence of multiple pathways with related functions , and gene redundancy due to the occurrence of paralogous genes . sequencing of several bcc genomes , followed by comparative genomics , is a powerful tool for the identification of virulence - associated genes of bcc bacteria , including new genes encoding proteins with no predicted function . in the sequenced bcc genomes , the percentage of protein encoding genes with unknown function varies between 13 and 35% ( http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi ) . it is quite possible that a significant percentage of these genes of unknown function might be involved , either directly or indirectly , in the pathogenesis of bcc bacteria . different strategies have been designed to identify pathogenicity - related genes from bcc bacteria , including the generation of mutant libraries with transposons and plasposons , systematic gene - by - gene inactivation and high - throughput sequencing , as illustrated in figure 1 . our research group has been using a strategy based on the generation of mutant libraries from b. cenocepacia and b. cepacia strains by random mutagenesis with plasposons , followed by rescue of the interrupted genes , sequencing and comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the interrupted genes with the available genome sequences of bcc strains , combined with the virulence assessment in the bcc infection models x - cgd mice and/or caenorhabditis elegans . a mutant library derived from b. cepacia ist408 allowed the identification of the bce - i gene cluster that encodes proteins and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide ( eps ) cepacian . cepacian is composed of a branched acetylated heptasaccharide repeat unit with d - glucose , d - rhamnose , d - mannose , d - galactose , and d - glucuronic acid , in the ratio 1  :  1  :  1  :  3  :  1 , respectively . several studies have shown that cepacian interfered with the phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils and , inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis , and the production of reactive oxygen species [ 44 , 45 ] . the ability to produce this eps was also associated with persistence of infection in the balb / c and x - cgd mice models of infection [ 44 , 46 ] . studies performed with cepacian - defective mutants have also shown that cepacian is required for the formation of thick and mature biofilms . biofilm formation in vitro is a common trait of bcc strains and has been associated with the persistence of bcc infections . in addition , bacteria of the bcc growing in biofilms have been found to be more resistant to antimicrobials than those growing plancktonically . it is also worth to mention that in a recent study by dales et al . ( 2009 ) , biofilms formed by bcc were found to be more resistant to antibiotics compared to p. aeruginosa biofilms . remarkably , a mutant producing about one half of the amount of the eps was recently found to carry a plasposon insertion interrupting a gene encoding the rna chaperone hfq . hfq proteins are global regulators of metabolism , acting as rna chaperones involved in the riboregulation of target mrnas by small regulatory noncoding rnas ( srnas ) , facilitating the interaction with their target mrnas . the b. cepacia   hfq mutant was shown to be more susceptible to stress conditions , particularly to those that mimicked the lung environment of the cf host , indicating that hfq plays a major role in the survival of bcc bacteria under those stress conditions . in addition , the hfq mutants from b. cepacia , b. dolosa , and b. ambifaria exhibited a reduced ability to colonize and kill the nematode c. elegans , indicating that hfq is an important virulence determinant of bcc bacteria . in agreement with the roles played by hfq in other bacteria , sousa et al . ( 2010 ) have also shown that the b. cepacia ist408 hfq is able to bind to srnas . recently , 213 putative srnas were identified within the genome of b. cenocepacia j2315 , based on the combination of comparative genomics and prediction of their secondary structures . work in progress envisages the identification and characterization of srnas from bcc to gain clues on their possible contributions to virulence . another mutant library , derived from the highly epidemic strain b. cenocepacia j2315 , allowed the identification of a gene encoding an acyl carrier protein ( acp ) . bacterial acps play a central role in metabolism , being the donors of the acyl moiety that is required for the biosynthesis of fatty acids , phospholipids , endotoxins , glycolipids , and signalling molecules that are necessary for growth and pathogenesis . the acp mutant exhibited an increased ability to form biofilms in vitro , a more hydrophobic cell surface , and reduced ability to colonize and kill the nematode c. elegans , indicating that acp protein is a virulence determinant for bcc bacteria . in addition , the amino acid sequence and structural differences between the acp proteins from bacteria and humans make this protein an attractive target for the development of novel antimicrobial compounds . the screen of this library for mutants impaired in their ability to kill the nematode c. elegans allowed the identification of the regulatory protein pbr . the pbr mutant exhibited a pleiotropic phenotype , being unable to produce phenazines , exhibited a reduced resistance to stresses such as oxidative and osmotic stress , and a reduced ability to survive prolonged nutrient starvation periods . a signature - tagged mutagenesis ( stm ) strategy was used by hunt et al . to identify putative virulence factors of bcc   ( figure 1 ) . stm is a comparative hybridization technique that uses a collection of transposons , each modified by the incorporation of a dna sequence tag . the pool of mutants is inoculated into a chronic pulmonary infection animal model and the bacteria recovered after infection are identified due to the tags . mutants containing a transposon insertion in genes required for survival will fail to pass through the in vivo selection , thus allowing the identification of these genes . this strategy led to the identification of several b. cenocepacia k56 - 2 genes that were required for bacterial survival in a rat model of chronic lung infection , including genes involved in cellular metabolism , global regulation , dna replication and repair , cell surface proteins , and polysaccharide production . a suppression - subtractive hybridization ( ssh ) strategy was used to identify genes that are unique to the b. cenocepacia and/or to et12 epidemic lineage strains   ( figure 1 ) . recently , a high - throughput sequencing strategy was used to compare the transcriptional response of clinical and environmental strains of b. cenocepacia   ( figure 1 ) . this strategy revealed a large number of regulatory differences between environmental and clinical strains , which might result from specific adaptations to each of the different niches , despite their high degree of dna sequence similarity . genes that encode for molecular chaperones and iron acquisition proteins were found to be particularly induced in the clinical strain . all these strategies have allowed the identification of several genes putatively involved in the virulence of bcc strains . however , the characterization of knockout mutants in these genes is hampered by limited available genetic tools and the inherent resistance of bcc strains to the most common antibiotics used for genetic selection . in this context for instance , lefebre and valvano ( 2002 ) constructed several expression vectors that contain the dhfr gene , encoding the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme required for trimethoprim resistance , together with either the constitutive promoter of the s7 ribossomal protein gene from burkholderia sp lb400 , or the arabinose - inducible bad promoter from escherichia coli . however , the concentration of arabinose required for maximal gene expression [ 2% ( w / v ) or higher ] causes a change in cell volume typical of osmotic stress . as a consequence , the full complementation of a given mutation using these vectors is seldom achieved , limiting its use . therefore , those authors have constructed another expression vector , containing the rhamnose - regulated prhab promoter of e. coli that allows maximal gene expression at low concentrations of rhamnose . another limitation derives from the fact that the b. cenocepacia j2315 strain is a poor recipient of dna in transformation and conjugation . as an example , transformation of b. cepacia ist408 with plasposon ptnmod was 10-fold more efficient than b. cenocepacia j2315 ( s. a. sousa and j. h. leito , unpublished results ) . recently , the electroporation procedure for this strain was modified to increase its transformation efficiency . factors that contribute to this improvement include the addition of glycine to the growth medium to weaken the thick cell wall , demethylation of transforming dna by extraction from a e. coli dam dcm host strain to escape to the j2315 restriction system specific for methylated gatc sites , the inclusion of the ocr protein in the transformation mixture to act as a decoy to inhibit type i restriction endonuclease attack of entering dna , and the use of spermine to reduce the resistance of the b. cenocepacia j2315 strain to several antibiotics . other strategies used to effectively generate bcc mutants rely on the lambda red recombinase system , as proposed by datsenko and wanner ( 2000 ) . this strategy uses linear dna transformations   and has allowed the successful homologous expression of a lipase gene in b. cepacia , as well the construction of an insertion mutant in b. cenocepacia j2315 bcal1538 ( c. g. ramos , s. a. sousa , j. h. leito , unpublished results ) . a combination of one or more of the previous approaches has allowed the identification of several potential virulence factors , including the cable pili and various adhesins , flagella , a type iii and a type vi secretion systems [ 67 , 68 ] , lipopolysaccharide , four types of iron - chelating siderophores ( salicylic acid , ornibactin , pyochelin , cepaciachelin , and cepabactin ) , production of extracellular proteins , like proteases , lipases , and haemolysins [ 71 , 72 ] , quorum - sensing systems [ 73 , 74 ] , and others ( recently reviewed in ) . however , not all strains produce each of these virulence factors , and none of these factors has been clearly demonstrated to be a major contributor to human disease . in fact , contrasting with other pathogens , the pathogenicity of bcc bacteria does not rely on a single gene . accumulating evidences point out that bcc virulence is polygenic , involving genes related to survival under stress conditions [ 50 , 7678 ] . nevertheless , the bcc genome is equipped with the known crucial genes for colonization and initiation of chronic infection in the respiratory tract , which are involved in motility , adhesion , and host tissue damage . another important feature of some bcc strains is their ability to invade and survive inside eukaryotic cells , including soil - dwelling amoebae , human macrophages , and airway epithelial cells . members of the bcc have emerged in the last decades as important pathogens to human , animals , and plants . the pathogenicity of these bacteria is polygenic , and thus involves a multitude of known and unknown virulence factors and determinants . several strategies have been successfully used by several research groups to reveal novel and unknown virulence factors and determinants . the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms employed by bcc bacteria for virulence and pathogenesis is of crucial importance to identify new targets for the rational design of novel strategies and/or molecules to combat bcc infections , since their resistance to most of the clinically - relevant antimicrobials renders the infections untreatable . in order to be regarded as a potential drug target , a given gene or gene product must be essential for survival of the pathogen in the host and should be conserved in the various strains of the pathogen , while presenting little or no conservation in humans . genome - based strategies , including genome sequencing , microarray - based expression technology , and large - scale mutagenesis studies , are expected to contribute , in the near future , for the development of new strategies and/or antimicrobials molecules to fight the devastating and presently difficult - to - treat infections caused by bcc strains .","the burkholderia cepacia complex ( bcc ) comprises at least 17 closely - related species of the -proteobacteria subdivision , widely distributed in natural and man - made inhabitats . 
 bcc bacteria are endowed with an extraordinary metabolic diversity and emerged in the 1980s as life - threatening and difficult - to - treat pathogens among patients suffering from cystic fibrosis . 
 more recently , these bacteria became recognized as a threat to hospitalized patients suffering from other diseases , in particular oncological patients . in the present paper , 
 we review these and other traits of bcc bacteria , as well as some of the strategies used to identify and validate the virulence factors and determinants used by these bacteria . 
 the identification and characterization of these virulence factors is expected to lead to the design of novel therapeutic strategies to fight the infections caused by these emergent multidrug resistant human pathogens .",179
"oxygen - sensing mechanisms enable the cell to adapt to low oxygen environments and are also critical for normal development and apoptosis . disruptions of oxygen - sensing pathways can lead to the development of certain forms of cancer [ 115 ] . oxygen sensing is mediated partly via the egln hydroxylases ( egln1/egln2/egln3 ) that are dependent upon molecular oxygen , iron ( ii ) and -ketoglutarate to perform proline hydroxylation on their target [ 1620 ] . therefore these enzymes are considered oxygen and also metabolic sensors . the availability of molecular oxygen is absolutely required for the hydroxylation reaction , because it donates the oxygen atom to the hydroxyl group . but equally important for the hydroxylation reaction is the electron donor -ketoglutarate , a metabolite from the krebs cycle . since egln is dependent upon metabolites that take part in the krebs cycle , they are directly tied into the cellular metabolic network ( fig . egln prolyl hydroxylases ( also referred to as phd ) belong to the 2-oxoglutarate - dependent oxygenase superfamily . the reaction proceeds via the incorporation of dioxygen into the prolyl residue forming hydroxyproline at the substrate . as electron donor for this reaction serves -ketoglutarate ( = 2-oxoglutarate ) which is oxidized to succinate and co2 . the dependency of the metabolite -ketoglutarate for catalytic activity makes these enzymes sensitive to -ketoglutarate levels and ties them directly into the metabolic network . the first identified substrate for the egln prolyl hydroxylases is the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor  ( hif- ) [ 16 , 17 ] . the identification of hif- as a direct hydroxylation substrate provided the first and direct link between tumour suppressor function and oxygen sensing . the tumour suppressor von hippel lindau ( vhl ) acts as an ubiquitin ligase by targeting hydroxylated hif- for degradation when oxygen is available , as where under low oxygen environments , hif- escapes hydroxylation and subsequently escapes vhl recognition [ 35 , 16 , 2227 ] . the escape from vhl recognition allows hif- to accumulate and to transactivate its target genes that are important for adaptation to low oxygen environment including energy metabolism and angiogenesis [ 2830 ] . both hif - dependent and hif - independent vhl functions contribute to vhl - defective tumorgenesis [ 3134 ] . the vhl disease is caused by inactivating germline mutations of the vhl gene and predisposes to a variety of tumours including haemangioblastoma of the retina and nervous system , clear cell renal carcinomas ( rcc ; the most common form of kidney cancer ) and phaeochromocytomas / paragangliomas , tumours of the sympathoadrenal nervous system . hif- deregulation appears to have a causal role in vhl - defective clear cell rcc and in vhl - defective blood vessel tumours haemangioblastomas ( hb ) . although hif- regulation has been a major focus of vhl research , the genotype  phenotype correlation in the vhl disease gave insight into hif - independent vhl function ( table 1 ) . specific vhl germline mutations corresponding to a specific subset of tumour phenotypes have a different relationship to hif- deregulation ( categorized in type i / iia / iib / iic disease ) [ 3537 ] . the type i disease associates with rcc and hb , and their tumours reflect deregulated high hif- expression , whereas a very different clinical outcome is observed in the type 2c - vhl disease . more importantly , hif- is not deregulated and maintains in low levels in the type 2c tumours [ 31 , 32 ] . these findings suggest that hif- deregulation is not necessary for phaeochromocytma development in vhl disease . phenotype correlation in the vhl disease interestingly , a second hydroxylation target of the prolyl hydroxylases egln has recently been identified . the 2-adrenergic receptor is a prototypic g protein - coupled receptor , which is hydroxylated by egln3 and also oxygen dependent degraded by pvhl . the discovery of another hydroxylation substrate by the egln enzymes not only broadens the functionality of prolyl hydroxylation , but also expands our understanding of cellular response to oxygen and its relationship to disease . therefore , the identification of other egln substrates and the clues from the genotype  phenotype correlation that emerged in the vhl disease clearly indicates hif - independent vhl functions . of great insights are studies from egln3-mediated neuronal apoptosis during sympathetic neuronal development , which shed light onto the genesis of phaeochromocytoma by presumably hif - independent pathways . phaeochromocytomas are rare , with only five to eight cases diagnosed per million people a year . extra - adrenal phaeochromocytomas are sometimes referred to as paragangliomas . in short , these tumours are sympathetic nervous system tumours . the most frequent causes of phaeochromocytoma susceptibility are vhl missense mutations , activating mutations in c - ret , mutations in neurofibromatosis type 1 ( nf1 ) and mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunits of mitochondrial complex ii ( sdh b / c / d ) . loss of nf1 has been reported to promote survival of embryonic sympathetic neurons in the absence of the nerve growth factor ngf . further , mutations in subunits of mitochondrial complex ii suggest impairment of mitochondria - mediated apoptosis and have led to the early hypothesis that failure of apoptosis in neuroendocrine precursor cells could result in the development of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma . given the evidence that nf1 promotes sympathetic neuronal survival and further that these neoplasias originate from the sympathetic nervous system , a closer look into the sympathetic neuronal development reveals important clues to the genesis of these tumours . since the discovery by rita levi - montalcini and viktor hamburger of the neurotrophic factor ngf , our understanding of developmental apoptosis in the sympathetic nervous system has greatly increased . during neuronal development competition for ngf is an important developmental process for matching the size of a neuronal population , especially in the peripheral nervous system . as much as 50% of neurons produced during embryogenesis die by apoptosis during neuronal development . abnormal ngf signalling has been linked to paediatric nervous system tumours such as neuroblastoma [ 44 , 45 ] and disease - associated mutations such as nf1 have been shown to enhance signalling by ngf receptors and promote neuronal survival in the absence of ngf . in the last decades it became evident that jnk / c - jun signalling is required for apoptosis when ngf is limiting in the developing nervous system [ 4650 ] . egln3 is induced in sympathetic neurons deprived of ngf and further has pro - apoptotic activity when overexpressed . given that egln3 is known to hydroxylate hif- and has been implicated in developmental apoptosis in sympathetic neurons , the following questions arise : ( i ) does egln3-mediated apoptosis depend upon its hydroxylation activity ? ( ii ) does it depend upon hif hydroxylation or does it involve hydroxylation of unknown substrates ? ( iii ) is failure of egln3-mediated apoptosis implicated in the genesis of phaeochromocytomas and other tumours arising from the neural crest origin ? the ability of egln3 to induce neuronal apoptosis appears to be unique among the egln family members . induction of apoptosis is dependent upon egln3 hydroxylation activity , because catalytic impaired egln3 fails to induce apoptosis [ 9 , 52 ] . importantly , egln3-induced apoptosis is not diminished in the presence of stable hif1 or hif2 variants that can not be hydroxylated on their prolines . this suggests that hydroxylation targets of egln3 other than hif- are crucial for apoptosis function . egln2 and egln3 are induced by hypoxia and dampen the hif- response under chronic hypoxia [ 5357 ] . however , egln1 appears to be the primary hif prolyl hydroxylase under normal conditions . consistent with this , mice lacking egln2 or egln3 are viable and grossly normal whereas mice lacking egln1 are not viable . conditional inactivation of egln1 in mice leads to polycythemia due to hif- stabilization and increased transcription of hif target genes including erythropoietin [ 60 , 61 ] . further , patients carrying egln1 mutations have been reported to develop polycythemia concluding that egln1 couples hif- stability in vivo[13 , 62 , 63 ] . consistent with the unique role of egln3 in neuronal apoptosis are studies obtained from the egln3-deficient mice that clearly demonstrates the requirement for egln3-mediated apoptosis during the sympathetic neuronal development . egln3 deficient sympathetic neurons are resistant to apoptosis after ngf withdrawal , as well as certain neurotoxins . consistently , egln3 mice have an increased number of cells in the super cervical ganglia and in the adrenal medulla and show abnormalities in the sympathoadrenal system including systemic hypotension . in fact , it appears that some of the adrenal abnormalities are caused through deregulation of the 2-adrenic receptor ( 2-ar ) . loss of egln3 results in 2-ar up - regulation and accordingly , hypoxia stabilizes the 2-ar . this is consistent with the observations from the type 2c vhl patients that develop phaeochromocytoma . type 2c patients often show excessive secretion of catecholamines ( endogenous 2-ar ligands ) and increased sympathonervous system activity . in summary , this points towards distinct and unique functions within the family of egln prolyl hydroxylases . identification of novel egln hydroxylation targets will open new oxygen sensing pathways independent of what we have learned from hif-. given the evidence that ( i ) phaeochromocytomas are sympathetic nervous system tumours and that ( ii ) egln3 is critical for apoptosis during sympathetic neural development , an attractive hypothesis emerged in which failure of egln3-mediated apoptosis during sympathetic development predisposes to the genesis of phaeochromocytomas and perhaps other neoplasia arising from neural crest origin . interestingly , apparently unlinked phaeochromocytoma lesions ( vhl , nf1 , c - ret and sdh ) all appear to act on a single common pathway by decreasing egln3-mediated apoptosis at the time during development when levels of ngf become limiting ( fig . egln3 appears to act downstream of the c - jun in the ngf signalling pathway . therefore , a single pathway was established in which the genetic phaeochromocytoma defects act either directly on egln3 or upstream of egln3 to impair apoptosis ( fig . 2 ) . for instance , the genetic defect in sdh acts directly on egln3-mediated apoptosis function . sdh inhibition results in accumulation of intracellular succinate , which in turn can product - inhibit the egln prolyl hydroxylases [ 9 , 71 ] . this succinate - mediated inhibition not only results in hif stabilization , but also importantly inhibits egln3-mediated apoptosis . the succinate - mediated product - inhibition of egln3 was overcome by re - addition of -ketoglutarate restoring ngf - mediated apoptosis . this suggests that sdh inhibition acts on the prolyl hydroxylases via succinate and not as alternatively suggested through the generation of reactive oxygen species . , ngf is required for neuronal survival but is also limiting . neurons that successfully compete for ngf survive whereas unsuccessful neurons undergo c - jun - dependent apoptosis . c - jun transcriptionally activates prolyl hydroxylase egln3 . as ngf levels become limiting , familial phaeochromocytoma mutations ( vhl , nf1 , c - ret , sdh and kif1b ) all decrease apoptosis mediated by egln3 . in addition to the predisposing sdh genetic lesion , other phaeochromocytoma lesions have been implicated upstream of egln3 to promote neuronal survival in the ngf signalling pathway . in the case of vhl predisposing lesion , pvhl suppresses junb and all vhl mutants tested ( including type iic vhl disease mutant ) abrogate its ability to do so . junb acts as an antagonist of c - jun and increased junb levels attenuate the induction of c - jun - mediated apoptosis in sympathetic neurons deprived from ngf . finally , previous evidence indicated that ret ( the receptor for glial - derived neurotrophic factor ) and nf1 could act through this pathway by modulating the action of the ngf receptor trka . activation of c - ret , like loss of pvhl , leads to the induction of junb and attenuates apoptosis when ngf becomes limiting . thus , when mutated , all the genetic phaeochromocytoma lesions ( sdh , vhl , c - ret and nf1 ) impair ngf - mediated apoptosis in neuroendocrine precursors during development . these findings provide an explanation as to why the mutations in tumour suppressors that are found in familial phaeochromocytoma are rare in sporadic phaeochromocytoma . this is because the pathway is no longer critical once development is completed . in summary , all the genetic lesions associated with phaeochromocytoma act on a single common pathway that impinges upon egln3 apoptotic activity during sympathetic neuronal development . mutations in sdh , vhl , c - ret and nf1 would allow sympathetic neuronal precursors to escape from developmental apoptosis and set the stage for their neoplastic transformation . it will be interesting to determine not only if egln3 is mutated in these neoplasias , but also , if failure of egln3 developmental apoptosis plays a broader role in paediatric cancers and other forms of hereditary cancer . an important challenge is to identify the link between this enzyme and apoptosis , which presumably involves hydroxylation of a protein other than hif-. early studies indicated that egln3 mrna and protein expression ( at that time referred as sm-20 ) increases shortly after removal of ngf in primary sympathetic neurons and peaks between 10 and 15 hrs at a time when cells undergo apoptosis . overexpression of egln3 is sufficient to promote cell death in ngf - maintained sympathetic neurons [ 51 , 73 ] . cell death is caspase dependent and accompanied by an increase of cytochrome c in cytosolic and mitochrondria - enriched subcellular fractions . the mechanism underlying egln3-induced cytochrome c is not known although it appears to involve an increase in cytochrome c mrna . other studies have identified egln3 as a growth factor inducible gene in vascular smooth muscle cells   and later proposed , that it might function in growth arrest , differentiation and cell death during muscle differentiation [ 76 , 77 ] . expression of egln3 was also reported in fibroblasts upon activation of a temperature - sensitive form of p53 . however , egln3-induced apoptosis appears not to be impaired in cells lacking p53 or expressing a dominant negative p53 protein , indicating that p53 might not function downstream of egln3 to induce apoptosis . in addition , a recent study indicated that egln3 s ability to induce apoptosis correlates with the formation of aggresome - like structures . recently , an unbiased genome - wide approach has been undertaken to understand how egln3 causes neuronal cell death . this led to the identification of the kinesin kif1b as a downstream effector of egln3 . kif1b , a member the kinesin 3 family , consists of two major splice variants  and . kif1b and kif1b are motor proteins implicated in anterograde transport of mitochondria and synaptic vesicle precursors , respectively [ 79 , 80 ] . the recent study , which identified kif1b as an egln3 downstream target showed how kif1b is both necessary and sufficient for neuronal apoptosis when ngf becomes limiting , but it remained unclear how egln3 regulates kif1b. interestingly , kif1b maps on to the chromosomal region 1p36.2 , a region of the genome that is frequently deleted in neural crest - derived tumours including neuroblastomas . the existence of one or more human tumour suppressor genes on chromosome 1p has been suspected for decades [ 8284 ] . further suggestion that kif1b acts as a 1p36 tumour suppressor comes from the current model for phaeochromocytoma development . phaeochromocytomas develop when sympathetic neuronal precursors escape from egln3-mediated developmental apoptosis , suggesting that mutations in kif1b may be relevant to phaeochromocytoma and other tumours of neuronal origin . indeed , inherited loss - of - function kif1b missense mutations have been identified in phaeochromocytomas and neuroblastomas and an acquired loss - of function mutation in a medullablastoma , arguing that kif1b is a pathogenic target of these deletions . nonetheless , it has been further reported that the remaining kif1b allele in 1p deleted tumours and cell lines is often wild - type , contrary to the knudson twohit scenario [ 64 , 8588 ] . also , the existence of multiple neuroblastoma and phaeochromocytoma suppressor genes on 1p has been suggested [ 89 , 90 ] . additional studies are needed to address how often it is deregulated , epigenetically or genetically , in cancer . a spotlight is now on understanding the mechanistic basis of how egln3 regulates kif1b and how this translates into cell death . kif1b appears not be a direct egln3 hydroxylation target , but egln3 hydroxylation activity is required for kif1b regulation . therefore egln3 presumably involves hydroxylation of a protein that in turn might regulate kif1b to induce apoptosis . in 1924 , otto warburg observed that cancer cells are highly glycolytic in the presence of oxygen and have reduced rates of oxidative phosphorylation . recent studies have argued that cancer cells might benefit from this persistence of high lactate production in the presence of oxygen , referred to as aerobic glycolysis or pseudo - hypoxia [ 92 , 93 ] . from a bioenergetic perspective , it remains a conundrum how highly metabolic proliferative cancer cells undergo a pathway that results in 10 times less atp production compared to their normal counterparts that oxidize their glycolysis endproduct within the mitochondria via the krebs cycle ( pyruvate conversion into acetyl - coa , fig . interestingly , three major enzymes of the krebs cycle ( sdh , fh , idh ) have been recently identified as bonafide tumour suppressors , but more importantly , inactivation in either of them directly affects egln activity [ 9 , 10 , 14 , 71 ] . this is because the egln activity is not only dependent upon molecular oxygen to perform their hydroxylation reaction , but also require the krebs cycle metabolite -ketoglutarate as electron donor , which ties them directly into this metabolic network . therefore an attractive hypothesis arises : cancer cells favour aerobic glycolysis to inhibit egln activity in order to escape either certain oncogenic apoptotic signals and/or activate oncogenic hif-. about 70% or more of low - grade gliomas bear loss of function mutation in idh1 and idh2 [ 94 , 95 ] . subsequently egln prolyl hydroxylases are inhibited in their hydroxylase activity with the consequences of hif- stabilization . presumably egln3-mediated apoptosis might be impaired in these settings as well , but this has not been investigated yet . further , these studies follow the discoveries that germline mutation in sdh are linked to phaeochromocytoma and that fh mutation lead to leiomyosarcoma and renal cell carcinoma , both of which affect also the egln prolyl hydroxylase activity [ 9 , 10 , 71 ] . this is because loss of function mutation in sdh and fh increases the accumulation of succinate and fumarate respectively . the excess of these metabolites inhibits the proline hydroxylases with the consequences in either accumulation of oncogenic hif- and/or blunting egln3-mediated apoptosis [ 9 , 10 , 71 , 96 ] . the krebs cycle enzymes ( sdh , fh and idh ) are tumour suppressors and linked to egln activity . the egln prolyl hydroxylases are dependent upon the krebs cycle metabolite -ketoglutarate as electron donor for hydroxylation activity . loss of function mutation in idh decreases -ketoglutarate levels and subsequently impairs egln function . on the other hand , mutation in sdh or fh leads to accumulation of succinate or fumarate respectively , which in turn product - inhibits egln activity . loss of function of sdh , fh or idh would lead to impaired krebs cycle activity and impaired oxidative phosphorylation with the consequence of enhanced glycolysis ( embden  meyerhof pathway ) to generate atp . the generated pyruvate during glycolysis is redirected away from the krebs cycle by conversion into lactate . cancer cells tend to convert most glucose to lactate regardless of whether oxygen is present ( aerobic glycolysis ) , an observation that was first made by otto warburg in 1924 . despite the striking difference in atp production , cancer cells might favour aerobic glycolysis to escape from egln hydroxylation , resulting in the accumulation of oncogenic hif. and/or resistant to egln3-mediated apoptosis . the recently identified mutations in the metabolic / mitochondrial enzymes ( fh , sdhb / c / d , idh1/2 ) provide convincing evidence that alteration in cellular metabolism contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer . hence , 43 years later we are beginning to learn the depth of otto warburg s foresight that ( in his words )  cancer cells should be interpreted as a mitochondrial dysfunction and that  the prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen in normal body cells by a fermentation of sugar[97 , 98 ] . even if this is the prime cause for some cancers , the underlying mechanistic basis remains controversial . however , recently it has become more evident that the inactivation of the egln prolyl hydroxylases is a downstream effector of these mitochondrial alterations . the identification of sdh and fh mutations has already led to the development of cell permeable -ketoglutarate derivates with the potential to suppress the transforming effects of these mutations through reactivation of the eglns . the exciting part of identifying metabolic - enzyme mutations in specific cancers is that they are druggable. they might provide new opportunities as therapeutic targets that would be more susceptible and more effective than existing cancer therapies . future work is needed to further elucidate the direct impact of cancer metabolism in prolyl hydroxylase functioning .","introductionlessons from a rare diseasespecificity of function within the egln prolyl hydroxylasesfailure of egln3-mediated apoptosis in the genesis of phaeochromocytomaunderstanding the mechanistic basis of egln3 killingconnecting egln activity to the warburg conundrumfuture directionsoxygen - sensing mechanisms are often dysfunctional in tumours . 
 oxygen sensing is mediated partly via prolyl hydroxylation . 
 the egln prolyl hydroxylases are well characterized in regulating the hypoxia inducible factor  ( hif- ) hypoxic response , but also are implicated in hif - independent processes . 
 egln3 executes apoptosis in neural precursors during development and failure of egln3 developmental apoptosis can lead to certain forms of sympathetic nervous system tumours . 
 mutations in metabolic / mitochondrial enzymes ( sdh , fh , idh ) impair egln activity and predisposes to certain cancers . 
 this is because the eglns not only require molecular oxygen to execute hydroxylation , but also equally require the electron donor -ketoglutarate , a metabolite from the krebs cycle . 
 therefore egln enzymes are considered oxygen , and also , metabolic sensors . 
 -ketoglutarate is crucial for egln hydroxylation activity , whereas the metabolites succinate and fumarate are inhibitors of the egln enzymes . 
 since egln activity is dependent upon metabolites that take part in the krebs cycle , these enzymes are directly tied into the cellular metabolic network . 
 cancer cells tend to convert most glucose to lactate regardless of whether oxygen is present ( aerobic glycolysis ) , an observation that was first made by otto warburg in 1924 . despite the striking difference in atp production 
 , cancer cells might favour aerobic glycolysis to escape from egln hydroxylation , resulting in the accumulation of oncogenic hif and/or resistance to egln3-mediated apoptosis .",392
"ectopic thyroid is a developmental defect of thyroid gland that leads to presence of thyroid tissue at sites other than its normal cervical location . it is frequently found along the course of the thyroglossal duct but can also be found at remote distant sites . it is very rare to have two ectopic foci of thyroid tissue , and only a very few cases of dual ectopia have been reported in the world literature . in 70% of cases of ectopic thyroid , it is extremely rare to have dual ectopic thyroid with a normally located pretracheal thyroid gland . a seventeen - year - old female presented with history of a swelling at the base of the tongue first noticed about eight months ago . the swelling gradually increased in size causing dysphagia . there was no history of pain , ulceration , or bleeding from the swelling or any symptoms of airway obstruction . local examination revealed a pink 2.5  2.5 centimeter swelling covered with intact mucosa and visible vessels over it at the base of the tongue ( figures 1 and 2 ) . thyroid function test suggested primary hypothyroidism with tsh 31.6  miu / l ( 0.44.0 ) , t4 50.5  nmol / l ( 57.9161 ) , and t3 1.82  nmol / l ( 1.252.74 ) . ultrasonography of the neck showed normally located thyroid gland but both lobes were hypoplastic ( figure 3 ) . fnac from the swelling was done which showed thyroid follicular cells in loosely cohesive sheets , microfollicular as well as macrofollicular arrangements ( figure 4(a ) , 4(b ) , 4(c ) , and 4(d ) , 400x , mgg ) . a thyroid scan with technetium-99 m showed two foci of intense uptake , one at the base of the tongue and another in the submental region consistent with dual ectopic thyroid ( figures 5 and 6 ) . she has since been put on 100 microgram of levothyroxine daily and is on regular followup . ectopic thyroid was first described by hickman in 1869 in a newborn who was suffocated 16 hours after birth because of a lingual thyroid causing upper airway obstruction . lingual thyroid is the most common ectopic thyroid accounting for 90% of all cases with a prevalence between 1  :  100000 and 1  :  300000 and a clinical incidence between 1  :  4000 and 1  :  10000 . other sites of ectopic thyroid are suprahyoid and infrahyoid , lateral aberrant thyroid , substernal goiters , struma ovarii , and struma cordis . ectopic thyroid has also been found in larynx , trachea , oesophagus , pericardium , diaphragm , and branchial cysts . rare cases of ectopic thyroid are described in parathyroid , cervical lymph nodes , submandibular gland , duodenal mesentery , adrenals , and carotid bifurcation . ectopic thyroid occurs more commonly in females and are usually seen during adolescence and pregnancy when the demand for thyroid hormone increases . upto 70% of patients with lingual thyroid have hypothyroidism , and 10% suffer from cretinism . the thyroid gland is not found in its usual location in 70% of patients with ectopic thyroid . presence of two ectopic foci of thyroid tissue simultaneously is rare , and very few such cases of dual thyroid ectopia have been reported in the world literature . in an extensive review of the literature , sood et al . found that the mean age of these patients was 15 years , more common in females with an f  :  m ratio of 1.25  :  1 . the symptoms varied from asymptomatic to anterior neck swelling with or without altered thyroid status . in almost all of these patients , one site of ectopy was at lingual or sublingual region . familial dual ectopic thyroids with perihyoid ectopic thyroid and lingual thyroid have also been described . lingual thyroid can cause foreign body sensation in tongue , dysphagia , dysphonia , or sensation of choking . large blood vessels present on the surface of lingual thyroid predispose it for ulceration . all diseases capable of affecting the normal thyroid can affect the ectopic thyroid like adenoma , hyperplasia , inflammation , and malignancy . the rate of malignant transformation in ectopic thyroid is no greater than in normally placed thyroid . carcinoma of the lingual thyroid is a rare clinical entity with an estimated incidence of 1% . carcinoma of lingual thyroid presents in the same manner as a symptomatic patient with a lingual thyroid . therefore , for exact pathological diagnosis a biopsy should always be taken . in our case lingual thyroid usually has a poorly defined capsule that leads to intermingling of glandular tissue with muscle elements raising the suspicion of malignancy . the most important diagnostic modality for ectopic thyroid is a thyroid scan with technetium-99 m , but ultrasonography , ct scan , and mri may help in defining the extension and location of the ectopic thyroid gland . asymptomatic and euthyroid patients do not require any treatment , but they should be followed up and looked after for any complications . patients with raised tsh with swelling should be put on replacement therapy with thyroid hormone which can produce a slow reduction of the mass . when medical treatment fails or there are obstructive symptoms or haemorrhage or suspicion of malignancy , then surgery should be considered . as malignant transformation has been described , some authors consider complete excision of ectopic thyroid as an appropriate treatment in all cases .","dual ectopic thyroid is a rare presentation of thyroid ectopia .

"medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor , with an incidence of ~0.5/100,000 children < 15 years old ( 1 ) . it is classified as grade iv according to the world health organization ( who ) ( 2 ) . current treatment consisting of surgery , radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy has a limited role in improving the prognosis of patients ( 3,4 ) . novel therapeutic methods based on the specific mechanism of medulloblastoma carcinogenesis an increasing number of studies have revealed that micrornas ( mirnas / mirs ) serve a role in tumorigenesis ( 59 ) . gene expression is regulated by thousands of known mirnas , which bind to imperfect complementary sites within the 3 untranslated regions of their target protein - coding mrnas , and repressing the expression of these genes at the level of mrna stability and translation ( 10 ) . previous research has revealed that mirnas are involved in the regulation of the majority of physiological and pathological process , including development , life span , and metabolism , and their dysregulation contributes to a number of types of disease , notably cancer ( 11 ) . these small rnas may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by modulating the levels of critical proteins , and their relevance in human disease and therapy is currently under investigation ( 12 ) . an increasing number of studies have demonstrated abnormal mirna expression levels in the central nervous system ( cns ) of cancer patients , suggesting that mirnas may serve as key regulatory components in cancer of the cns ( 5,10,13 ) . it was observed that 22 mirnas were upregulated and 26 mirnas were downregulated in the tumor tissue . ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) was used to analyze the regulatory network of the differentially expressed mirna in medulloblastoma . it was proposed that the pathways exhibited in the network may have an important role in the tumorigenesis of medulloblastoma . the data were downloaded from the ncbi gene expression omnibus ( geo ) database ( gse42657 , www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo ) . the data include 7 control samples ( consisting of 3 cerebellum and 4 frontal lobe controls ) and 9 medulloblastoma samples . the data from all samples was normalized using the limma package in r software version 3.3.0 ( https://www.r-project.org/ ) . the selected samples of this profile are exhibited in table i. the differentially expressed genes ( degs ) were obtained with the thresholds of |logfc|>1.0 and p<0.01 , using linear models and empirical bayes methods for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments in the limma package ( table ii ) . a heat map of the different groups was produced to visualize the degs and cluster the corresponding groups with the differentially expressed mirnas from the tumor tissue , using the r package gplots ( fig . the dataset ( 48 differentially expressed mirnas ) was uploaded to the ingenuity pathway analysis software version 2016 ( qiagen , inc . , valencia , ca , usa ) , using the microrna target filter to find the targeting information . a total of 40 micrornas targeting 11,757 mrnas were identified by the filter . the core analysis function ( rapid assessment of the signaling and metabolic pathways , molecular networks , and biological processes that are most markedly perturbed in the dataset of interest ) to analyze the associated network functions of the mirnas . using mirna microarray data from the geo database , 48 mirnas which are differentially expressed in medulloblastoma were identified , compared with the control group ( table ii ) . the core analysis demonstrated the molecular network interactions and signaling pathways associated with 28 differentially expressed mirnas of medulloblastoma , and their predicted molecular targets were rebuilt using ipa . the network organismal injury and abnormalities , reproductive system disease , cancer had an ipa score of 41 , focusing on 17 mirna molecules , and the network  cancer , organismal injury and abnormalities , cell death and survival had an ipa score of 23 , focusing on 11 mirna molecules ( fig . the most impacted biological processes and diseases regulated by the analyzed mirnas included organismal injury and abnormalities , reproductive system disease and cancer . the molecular network maps demonstrated that three primary components were identified to be at the central hub of the most significant network with a score of 41 ; these were tumor protein p53 ( tp53 ) , argonaute 2 ( ago2 ) and mitogen activated kinases 3 and 1 ( erk1/2 ) ( fig . tp53 , sirtuin 1 ( sirt1 ) and y box protein 1 ( ybx1 ) were located in the center of the second network with a core analysis score of 23 ( fig . the first network included mir-17 - 5p , mir-130a-3p , mir-182 - 5p , mir-18a-5p , mir-19b-3p , mir-4288 , mir-96 - 5p , which were upregulated in the medulloblastoma samples , and mir-128 - 3p , mir-132 - 3p , mir-133a-3p , mir-299a-5p , mir-409 , mir-668 - 3p , which were downregulated . the second notable network ( fig . 2b ) involved upregulated mir-217 - 5p and mir-216a-5p , and downregulated mir-329 , mir-330 and mir-584 , which are associated with the regulation of key regulatory genes in medulloblastoma development , including tp53 , sirt1 and ybx1 . however , when the cerebellum samples were used as the control , it was observed that 4 mirnas were overexpressed and 5 mirnas were underexpressed in the medulloblastoma ( table iii ) . the network  cell death and survival , gastrointestinal disease , hepatic system disease had an ipa score of 9 , focusing on 4 mirna molecules ( fig . mirnas function as master regulators and signal modulators by fine - tuning gene expression in multiple complex pathways . a number of the mirnas which exhibit dysregulated expression in medulloepithelioma have been reported to serve various roles in carcinogenesis ( 6,7,9 ) . through analysis of a geo mirna expression profiling dataset , mirnas which are over- and underexpressed in medulloblastoma were identified , including mir-217 , mir-216 , mir-183 , mir-182 and mir-96 , which are upregulated in tumor tissue . previous research demonstrates that mir-183 - 96 - 182 regulates cell survival , proliferation and migration in medulloblastoma , and increased mir-183 - 96 - 182 expression is associated with aggressive clinical course , high rates of metastasis and poor overall survival ( 8,9,14 ) . mir-217 and mir-216 were overexpressed in medulloblastoma . however , the role of mir-217 was controversial . mir-217 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in aggressive human b cell lymphomas ( 15 ) . however , it may be a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma ( 16 ) . in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm , pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and further studies are required to determine whether increased expression of mir-217 in medulloblastoma represents an oncogenic effect , or if the dysregulation functions as a potential tumor suppressor . while mir-216 was underexpressed in various types of cancer , including breast cancer , pancreatic cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( 1921 ) , it may serve as a tumor suppressor to inhibit cell proliferation , invasion and tumor growth . further studies are required to determine whether increased expression of mir-216 in medulloblastoma represents an oncogenic effect or is a potential tumor suppressor . in the present study , marked downregulation of mir-383 , mir-206 , mir-138 , mir-128a / b and mir-133b was identified . mir-383 , repressing peroxiredoxin 3 at transcriptional and translational levels , suppressed the cell growth of medulloblastoma ( 6 ) . additionally , mir-206 was downregulated in all the four molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma as well as in cell lines . orthodenticle homeobox 2 ( otx2 ) , a target gene of mir-206 which is overexpressed in all non - sonic - hedgehog - driven medulloblastomas , is an oncogene in medulloblastoma . therefore , underexpression of mir-206 contributed to the upregulation of otx2 expression and enhanced growth of medulloblastoma cell lines ( 7 ) . studies have demonstrated a reduction in the mirnas mir-383 , mir-138 , mir-128a / b , mir-133 , mir-124 and let-7 g in medulloblastoma . nevertheless , mir-328 , mir-133b , mir-149 , mir-181b and mir-154 were downregulated in the study of ferretti et al ( 5 ) and the present study . in addition , the present study revealed that mir-433 , mir-488 , mir-584 , mir-329 , mir-299 - 5p , mir-330 , mir-770 - 5p , mir-656 and mir-642 were underexpressed in medulloblastoma , and further research is required to identify whether these mirnas have a specific role in the tumorigenesis of medulloblastoma . based on microarray analysis , mirnas that distinguish normal brain from medulloblastoma tissue were identified . as presented in the heat map , the dysregulated mirnas are more closely associated with the medulloblastoma samples compared with the normal control samples . additionally , by uploading the mirnas from the first network to the ipa , it was identified that the dysregulated mirnas were associated with key regulatory genes in tumorigenesis , including tp53 , insulin - like growth factor 1 receptor , ago2 and erk1/2 . the overexpressed mirnas mir-17 - 5p and mir-182 ( log fold change > 2 ) have interactions with tp53 ; studies have demonstrated an association between these mirnas and tp53 in tumorigenesis ( 22,23 ) . agos are associated with mirnas , due to their function in the rna induced silencing complex ( risc ) , wherein they use small rna guides to recognize targets . ago2 had an interaction with mirnas that are dysregulated in medulloblastoma , including mir-17 - 5p , mir-128 , mir-96 , mir-433 , mir-383 and mir-138 . the second network , including mir-217 and mir-216 , which are upregulated in medulloblastoma , exhibits associations with key regulatory genes in medulloblastoma development , including tp53 , sirt1 and ybx1 . sirt1 is a well understood member of the sirtuin protein class , preventing cell aging and apoptosis of normal cells ( 24,25 ) . the effects of sirt1 are controversial ; the protein was considered to be a tumor promoter in neuroblastoma , prostate and skin cancer ( 2628 ) , whereas it was considered to be a tumor suppressor in breast and colon cancer ( 29,30 ) . therefore , sirt1 may serve a role in medulloblastoma and correlate with the formation and prognosis of human medulloblastomas ( 31 ) . recently , dey et al ( 32 ) proved that ybx1 ( yb1 ) is upregulated across human medulloblastoma subclasses and is required for medulloblastoma cell proliferation . furthermore , the study identified that the shh : yap : yb1:igf2 axis may be a powerful target for therapeutic intervention in medulloblastoma . when the medulloblastoma samples were compared with the normal cerebellum , 9 dysregulated mirnas were identified . the 9 mirnas were uploaded to the ipa in order to perform the core analysis . the network involved 4 downregulated mirnas and was associated with important regulators of tumorigenesis , including met proto - oncogene ( met ) , akt serine - threonine kinase 1 and sterol regulatory element - binding factor 1 ( srebf1 ) . previous evidence has demonstrated the association between aberrant met signaling and medulloblastoma development ( 33,34 ) . previous studies have revealed that overexpressed mir-206 may inhibit met in lung cancer ( 35,36 ) , however the function of downregulated mir-206 in medulloblastoma is unknown . srebf1 is a transcription factor , regulating lipogenesis , which is also involved in tumorigenesis ( 37 ) . these network components alone are not sufficient to initiate medulloblastoma formation ; the interactions between these dysregulated factors and additional genetic insults promote tumorigenesis . in conclusion , based on the mirna array data in the geo database , mirnas which are differentially expressed in medulloblastoma samples were identified . certain dysregulated mirnas have been confirmed ; however , further research is required to verify the mirnas which have not been previously identified . additionally , the ipa core analysis , presenting the interaction of mirnas and counterpart targets , provides a method to understand the tumorigenesis of medulloblastoma . the results of the present study may provide a potent target for therapeutic intervention or diagnosis in medulloblastomas .","medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of the central nervous system among children . 
 medulloblastoma is an embryonal tumor , of which little is known about the pathogenesis . 
 several efforts have been made to understand the molecular aspects of its tumorigenic pathways ; however , these are poorly understood . 
 microrna ( mirna ) , a type of non - coding short rna , has been proven to be associated with a number of physiological processes and pathological processes of serious diseases , including brain tumors . 
 differentially expressed mirnas serve an important role in numerous types of malignancy . 
 the present study aims to define a differentially expressed set of mirnas in medulloblastoma tumor tissue , compared with normal samples , to improve the understanding of the tumorigenesis . 
 it was identified that 22 mirnas were upregulated and 26 mirnas were downregulated in the tumor tissue compared with the normal group . however , when the medulloblastoma tissue was compared with normal cerebellum tissue , 9 mirnas were identified to be up or downregulated in the tumor samples . 
 the differentially expressed mirnas in the tumor tissue were identified in order to clarify the networks and pathways of tumorigenesis using ingenuity pathway analysis . 
 subsequently , key regulatory genes associated with the development of medulloblastoma were identified , including tumor protein p53 , insulin like growth factor 1 receptor , argonaute 2 , mitogen - activated protein kinases 1 and 3 , sirtuin 1 and y box binding protein 1 .",321
"it presents with various obstructive and irritative lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) like frequency , urgency , nocturia , intermittency , weak urinary stream etc . the international prostate symptom score ( ipss ) is a tool which is very commonly used in the evaluation of the severity of symptoms of the patients . it is a self - administered questionnaire which scores the symptoms the patient has experienced over of the preceeding 4 weeks . it helps the clinician understand the severity of patient 's symptoms and can guide treatment . hence the responses can depend upon the level of education and understanding of the patient . this can have a significant bearing on the ultimate score and can lead to improper selection of treatment . it can lead to significant distress both to the patient and to the treating physician due to the lack of optimum response by the treatment based on the ipss . the ipss questionnaire has been translated and validated in various languages but it has not been validated in any of the indian languages . we commonly employ the english version of the questionnaire . for a population that does not have english as its primary language , this issue may have a serious impact on the understanding of questions and the scoring . in this study , we evaluate the patient 's ability to understand the ipss by comparing the scores when the questionnaire was self - administered versus when it was administered using the assistance of a clinician . patients who presented with luts suggestive of bph , those who had passed at least twelfth grade school and had a reasonable command over english ( assessed by their ability to have a conversation in english with the clinician ) were included in the study . those who had previously filled an ipss questionnaire or those who were < 40 years of age were excluded from the study . the patients were first given the ipss questionnaire and were allowed to self - administer it . the score sheet was taken away and then a blinded clinician ( 2 year resident in urology ) , who was not aware of the score on the self administered questionnaire , assisted the patient in filling the responses ( english version ) by interpreting and explaining the meaning of the questions in english . the second questionnaire was administered on the same day , 4 - 5 hours after the administration of the first questionnaire . the ipss questionnaire comprises of eight questions , seven regarding the symptoms over a period of the preceedinglast 1 month and one assessing the quality - of - life . the seven questions assessing the symptoms include incomplete emptying , frequency , intermittency , urgency , weak stream , straining and nocturia . each of these symptoms is assigned a score from 0 to 5 for a maximum 35 points . the scores of these seven questions are added to determine the severity of patient urinary symptoms as follows , mild - 0 - 7 , moderate - 8 - 19 and severe - 20 - 35 . the eighth question assesses the quality of life is assigned a score of 0 - 6 . for each question , the score in both the questionnaires was noted and kappa agreement statistical test was used to assess the level of agreement between them . by convention , a kappa of 0.0 means that the agreement is no better than a chance event . kappa scores of 0.01 - 0.20 , 0.21 - 0.40 , 0.41 - 0.60 , 0.61 - 0.80 and 0.81 - 0.99 are interpreted as showing poor , fair , moderate , substantial and almost perfect agreement , respectively . the kappa values of the scores for each question have been shown in table 1 . no question had a perfect agreement of scores in the self - administered and the clinician assisted scoring scenarios . only the scores of questions about weak stream and nocturia showed  moderate the overall mean scores , kappa value and its interpretation for each question of the ipss questionnaire the total scores for each patient were calculated for both the clinical scenarios and they were classified into mild , moderate and severe categories as per the criteria mentioned before . it was found that total scores in the self - administered and the clinician assisted scoring agreed  poorly  with each other as the kappa value was 0.19 . the categorization of patient 's symptoms as per the ipss questionnaire when it was self - administered compared to when it was administered by an assessor ipss questionnaire is recommended by the american urological association during the work up of a patient with luts . apart from helping the clinician in assessing the severity of the symptoms of a patient , it also acts as a guide in selecting the appropriate mode of treatment which can vary from watchful waiting to surgery . studies in the western population have pointed out that there can be significant misinterpretation of the ipss by the patients . some of these studies have shown that it depends upon the level of education , with patients having a low level of education showing marked misinterpretation . the issue of non - availability of the questionnaire in a local language and its impact on the ability of a patient to self - administer a questionnaire in english has been highlighted by ogwuche et al . we also believe that a validated ipss questionnaire in an indian language may be helpful in decreasing the error in interpretation , but additional studies will be needed to prove this . it has also been reported that the error in interpretation of the ipss questionnaire can lead to miscategorization of the patients symptoms and selection of a treatment that may not be effective for him . for example , a patient who on self - administered ipss questionnaire has a score of 6 ( mild symptoms ) may be offered only watchful waiting while he actually may be having moderate or severe symptoms which becomes evident when the questionnaire is explained to him by a medical assistant . johnson et al . have pointed out that 25% of patients who self - reported a mild score on ipss actually had a moderate or severe score . in our study too , there was a misinterpretation of the ipss questionnaire by the patients . the scores for each question showed a poor agreement for five out of seven questions . there was also significant miscategorization of patients symptoms ( mild / moderate / severe ) when the scores on self - administered questionnaire were compared to the clinician assisted questionnaire . thus it is important to realize that although ipss questionnaire is an important tool in the work up of patients with luts , it should not be the sole guide for the treatment offered . our study shows that there are some questions that are more prone for misinterpretation by the patients hence assistance by a clinician may be desirable . we administered the questionnaire on the same day which might have an effect on the results as the patients might have been able to recall their responses in the first questionnaire . the second issue is that we did not stratify our results according to the level of education of the patients included in the study . it is possible that people with a higher education may have a lesser chance of misinterpretation of the questions . our results show that our patients , who do not have english as their primary language , misinterpret the ipss questionnaire . there are significant differences in the symptom scores when the ipss is self - administered as compared to the assisted scoring . this problem can lead to errors in interpretation of the symptom severity of patients by the health care providers ; may affect the choice of treatment and ultimately , the clinical outcome .","introduction : the international prostate symptom score ( ipss ) is commonly used in the evaluation of the severity of symptoms of patients with prostatic enlargement . 
 it is a self - administered questionnaire . 
 it has not been validated in any indian language and an english version is used which can be difficult to interpret by our patients who do not have english as their primary language . in this study , we evaluate the patient 's ability to understand the ipss by comparing the scores when the ipss questionnaire was self - administered versus when it was administered using the assistance of a clinician.materials and methods : patients who presented with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia , who had passed at least twelfth grade of school and had a reasonable command over english were included in the study .

"redox biological signaling has significantly developed over the last couple of decades with small molecules such as no , co , h2s , and h2o2 being identified as competent signaling agents . nitroxyl ( hno ) , the oneelectron reduced / protonated form of no , has been discussed as a signaling agent , but the lack of specific & selective detection methods hampers a better understanding of its biology . significant advances in hno detection have occurred with the development of new copper and phosphinebased fluorescent probes and new electrochemical & mass spectrometric methods . with these mechanistically different ways to detect hno , questions regarding hno 's biology and endogenous formation can be approached . the most significant result is that the azaylide intermediate generated from the reaction of these probes and hno rapidly and reliably undergo a staudinger ligation resulting in fluorescence and a stable amide byproduct . reaction of these probes with rsno gives a similar azaylide , but in this case , the staudinger ligation does not occur or proceeds inefficiently . flow cytometry experiments show that these reactions also occur in cells and that these probes only detects hno in cells . one of the challenges starting this project was to not let our previous ideas about the chemistry dictate what experiments to do . we knew that rsno reacts with phosphines to yield azaylides that should undergo ligations and yield fluorescence . should we continue if we were going to see that our probes were not selective ? zhengrui miao noticed that no one had ever really directly compared the response of these probes to hno and rsno . he did this comparison and found fluorescence generation from hno treatment was greatly enhanced compared with rsno , and these findings initiated the study . the overall lesson is to keep an open mind and do n't plan the outcome of your experiments !","abstract 
 invited for this month 's cover picture is the group of prof . 
 s.  bruce king at the department of chemistry of wake forest university . 
 the cover picture shows a prefluorescent phosphinebased probe reacting with nitroxyl ( hno ) and 
 s 
 nitrosothiol ( rsno ) , nitrogen oxidederived biological signals . 
 both species react with the prefluorescent probe , but only the product from the hno reaction can complete a further chemical ligation pathway that results in fluorescence , indicating the presence of hno . the product of the probe with rsno does not complete this ligation and does not generate a fluorescent species . 
 these phosphinebased probes thus demonstrate a selectivity for hno over rsno based on their chemical reactivity and can be used in biological systems to differentiate these species . for more details , see the communication on

"approximately 6% of patients undergoing dialysis have malignancies , and the number of these patients undergoing chemotherapy continues to increase . chemotherapy in dialysis patients is challenging because excretion of the drug differs between dialysis and non - dialysis patients . drugs that are excreted by dialysis may show reduced efficacy , while drugs that are not excreted may cause adverse events . imatinib is an effective and safe therapy for kit - positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . however , the efficacy and safety of imatinib treatment in dialysis patients remain unclear because clinical trials have not been conducted in this population . we report a patient with duodenal gist undergoing dialysis who was treated with regular - dose imatinib and remained stable with no adverse events for 4 months . we also present a literature review of the efficacy and safety of imatinib treatment in patients with gist undergoing dialysis . in a 75-year - old japanese man , a large duodenal tumor was identified on computed tomography ( ct ) in 2008 and was suspected as gist on endoscopic ultrasonography . however , the patient refused further investigation and underwent a follow - up visit . he also had chronic kidney disease , due to type 2 diabetes , and began a course of hemodialysis three times weekly in 2014 . a large - volume and painless tarry stool with hemorrhagic shock occurred in april 2014 . a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin level of 6.3 g / dl , and the patient required transfusion of 32 units of packed red blood cells to recover a general condition . contrast agent - enhanced ct scans revealed a duodenal tumor 14 cm in diameter , with multiple liver and bone metastases . the patient underwent an urgent upper endoscopy , which showed a 3.5-cm submucosal tumor with stigmata of recent hemorrhage in the bulb of the duodenum . endoscopic hemostasis was not conducted due to the large exposed vessel , and an urgent pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed to achieve hemostasis . the resected tumor showed a gist composed of spindle - shaped cells with positive staining for kit and cd34 and negative staining for s-100 ; the mitotic count was 12 per 50 high - power fields , and the mib-1 labeling index was 10% ( fig . the patient was treated with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily ( orally ) . complete blood counts showed a white blood cell count in the range of 3669  10/l , a hemoglobin level range of 8.9 - 10.2 g / dl , and a platelet count range of 162265  10/l . furthermore , no severe adverse event , including liver functional impairment , intestinal pneumonia , or stevens - johnson syndrome occurred . however , mild adverse events including fatigue and edema were observed , and his metastases remained stable for 4 months . finally , imatinib treatment was discontinued because of progression of the disease and worsening performance status in january 2015 . the patient died of duodenal perforation induced by residual tumor progression in february 2015 , 6 years after the initial diagnosis and 5 months after chemotherapy for gist . we administered regular - dose imatinib in a patient with multiple metastases from gist undergoing dialysis . the patient remained stable without any adverse event associated with imatinib for 4 months . to our knowledge , this is the first literature review and third case report of imatinib treatment for gist in patients undergoing dialysis . several cytotoxic drug therapies have been reported in patients with major gastrointestinal tract malignancies undergoing dialysis . dialysis patients with esophageal cancer have been administered 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] and dialysis patients with gastric cancer have been administered tegafur - uracil , docetaxel , and irinotecan [ 10 , 13 ] . dialysis patients with colon cancer have been treated with tegafur - uracil , irinotecan , and oxaliplatin [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] . in these cases , most cytotoxic drugs were used safely without dose modification , but irinotecan caused severe myelosuppression and resulted in death [ 15 , 18 ] . however , available data on molecular - specific therapies in dialysis patients are limited , and treatment - related issues are unclear . pappas et al .   reported a 44-year - old woman with rectal gist and liver metastasis undergoing dialysis for 1 year . six years later , she was diagnosed with liver metastasis of the resected rectal gist and received regular - dose imatinib for the liver metastasis . no severe adverse events associated with imatinib occurred , and the liver metastasis remained in partial remission for 12 months . reported a 69-year - old japanese man with peritoneal gist undergoing dialysis for 9 years . the main lesion of the peritoneum gist was resected , and he received regular - dose imatinib for residual disease . no severe adverse event occurred , and the residual disease remained in partial remission for 20 months . in our case and the previous cases , no severe adverse events were associated with imatinib . a previous study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of both imatinib and its metabolite cgp74588 in dialysis patients and reported that the pharmacokinetics of dialysis patients were similar to those of non - dialysis patients . the clinical importance of these data was supported by our results , and we also consider that dialysis patients can be treated safely with imatinib . heart failure was not observed in our case due to strict water management , but physicians should pay careful attention to patients with these findings . previous studies reported good clinical outcomes , with no recurrence after 1220 months [ 25 , 26 ] . imatinib treatment without dose reduction may contribute to good responses in patients undergoing dialysis as well as those without dialysis . in our case , overall survival was shorter than that in previous reports [ 25 , 26 ] , but the difference may be due to the clinical stage at the time of initiation of imatinib treatment . our case had poor prognostic factors , such as a lesion size larger than 11.1 cm , wall invasion , and hepatic metastasis . in conclusion , regular - dose imatinib was an effective and safe treatment in a patient with gist undergoing dialysis .","the number of cancer patients undergoing dialysis has been increasing , and the number of these patients on chemotherapy is also increasing . 
 imatinib is an effective and safe therapy for kit - positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) , but the efficacy and safety of imatinib in dialysis patients remain unclear . because clinical trials have not been conducted in this population , more investigations are required . 
 we report on a 75-year - old japanese man undergoing dialysis who presented with massive tarry stool from a duodenal gist . 
 the duodenal gist was 14 cm in diameter with multiple liver and bone metastases . 
 the patient underwent an urgent pancreaticoduodenectomy to achieve hemostasis . 
 after surgery , he was administered imatinib 400 mg / day . 
 no severe adverse event including myelosuppression , congestive heart failure , liver functional impairment , intestinal pneumonia , or steven - johnson syndrome occurred , and the liver metastasis remained stable for 4 months . during chemotherapy , 
 hemodialysis continued three times per week without adverse events . 
 we suggest that regular - dose imatinib is an effective and safe treatment in patients with gist undergoing dialysis . 
 in addition , we present a literature review of the effectiveness and safety of imatinib treatment in dialysis patients .",263
"to make adaptive choices , people should sometimes exhibit patience , forgoing immediate benefits to acquiring more valuable future rewards . humans account for future consequences when making temporal decisions , whereas many animal species wait only a few seconds for delayed benefits . the extreme differences between humans and nonhumans seem to provide powerful evidence that patience is uniquely a human trait ( 1 ) . a major focus of attention in psychology is on the determinants and consequences of well - being . personality traits and character strengths are the strongest and most consistent predictors of well - being ( 2 ) . there is also evidence of a genetic link between personality and well - being ( 3 ) . while the role of some personality traits such as gratitude , are comprehensively explored , scientific study of others such as patience are neglected . patience is commonly said to be a virtue , but not commonly included in the contemporary discussions of the good life . psychologists pay scant attention to this virtue , although they study it under related guises such as gratification delay ( 4 ) . in recent years , a 3-factor patience scale ( 3-fps ) was designed to measure three types of patience : interpersonal , life hardship and daily hassles patience ( 5 , 6 ) . life hardship represents patience toward long - term goals or hardships ( e.g. , chronic illness ) while daily hassles represents patience toward frustrating situations in daily life ( e.g. , traffic jams ) . interpersonal patience , for example , has a strong correlation with agreeableness , but life hardship and daily hassles patience have moderate correlations . however , it is not clear whether these relationships would hold across cultures in the same way . to establish the generalizability of patience as a unique predicator of mental well - being , it is important to show its cross - cultural consistency the current study aimed to examine the relationship between patience and mental health , subjective well - being and personality factors , in an iranian population . although all three types of patience are expected to correlate with higher levels of mental health and well - being , no hypothesis was made regarding the strength of these relationships . the age range of these 123 female and 129 male subjects was from 19 to 45 , with a mean of 23.43 and a standard deviation of 3.45 . the persian versions of the following measures were administered ; they have been previously used in the iranian samples ( except the patience scale ) and had proven to be valid . this 11 item scale is designed to measure three types of patience : interpersonal ( i am patient with other people ) , life hardship ( i am able to wait - out tough times ) , and daily hassles patience ( in general waiting in lines does not bother me ) . the 3-fps has internal consistency reliability , convergent validity and high test - retest reliability ( 5 , 6 ) . in the current study , items were translated into persian and the adequacy of translations was confirmed by having the persian version of questionnaire items translated back into english . similar to the original 3-fps ( 6 ) the persian scale , in the current study , had a three - factor structure , consisting of interpersonal patience (  = 0.74 , m = 3.55 , sd = 0.75 ) , long - term life hardships patience (  = 0.81 , m = 3.37 , sd = 0.93 ) , and short - term daily hassles patience (  = 0.64 , m = 3.19 , sd = 0.91 ) . cronbach s alpha was 0.82 for the 3-fps ( m = 3.39 ; sd = 0.67 ) . this five - item widely used measure of life satisfaction was used to measure the cognitive aspect of subjective well - being ( 7 ) . the persian version of this scale has convergent validity and test - retest and internal reliability , with coefficient alpha at 0.83 ( 8) . evidence of relative psychological dysfunction was obtained with the widely - used ghq-12 . this well - validated scale is a self - report instrument of psychological components of ill - health . the ghq-12 focuses on breaks in the normal function , rather than upon lifelong traits ( 9 ) . the persian version of the ghq-12 has high level of internal reliability ( with coefficient alpha at 0.87 ) and convergent validity with global quality of life scores ( 10 ) . the costello and comrey s ( 11 ) scales assess depression ( 14 items ) and anxiety ( 9 items ) as traits rather than states . cronbach s alphas for the persian versions of depression and anxiety scales are 0.90 and 0.84 , respectively ( 12 ) . the big - five factors of personality ( openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and emotional stability ) were measured using the 20-item , self - report mini international personality item pool - big five ( 13 ) . coefficient alphas of the persian versions of these five factors ranged from 0.59 to 0.73 ( 14 ) . the current study used a cross - sectional design and a convenience non - random sampling method . data were collected using self - administered questionnaires delivered to the students in person during the 2011 - 2012 academic year . the data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics including correlation , regression , and factor analyses by the spss software , version . this 11 item scale is designed to measure three types of patience : interpersonal ( i am patient with other people ) , life hardship ( i am able to wait - out tough times ) , and daily hassles patience ( in general waiting in lines does not bother me ) . the 3-fps has internal consistency reliability , convergent validity and high test - retest reliability ( 5 , 6 ) . in the current study , items were translated into persian and the adequacy of translations was confirmed by having the persian version of questionnaire items translated back into english . similar to the original 3-fps ( 6 ) the persian scale , in the current study , had a three - factor structure , consisting of interpersonal patience (  = 0.74 , m = 3.55 , sd = 0.75 ) , long - term life hardships patience (  = 0.81 , m = 3.37 , sd = 0.93 ) , and short - term daily hassles patience (  = 0.64 , m = 3.19 , sd = 0.91 ) . cronbach s alpha was 0.82 for the 3-fps ( m = 3.39 ;

 psychologists have paid scant attention to patience as a personality trait , character strength or virtue.objectives:the current study examined the relationship between patience and life satisfaction , mental health , and personality.materials and methods : a sample of 252 iranian college students ( 129 females and 123 males ) completed the 3-factor patience scale , satisfaction with life scale , general health questionnaire , anxiety and depression scales and mini international personality item pool - big five.results:the three types of patience ( interpersonal , life hardship , and daily hassles ) were associated with higher levels of life satisfaction and lower levels of depression , anxiety and psychological dysfunction . 
 patience also showed moderate relationship with the big - five factors of personality . 
 after controlling the personality factors , patience managed to explain additional unique variance in life satisfaction and mental health indicators.conclusions:patience is a unique predictor of mental well - being . 
 it is suggested that long - term patience is more important for depression and general health , whereas short - term patience is more beneficial for hedonic well - being .",237
"prescription writing is a complex and challenging task that requires diagnostic skills , knowledge of medicines , communication skills , an understanding of the principles of clinical pharmacology , and appreciation of risk . in recent years , medical researchers observe deficiencies in health care occurring due to many prescribing errors , which arise because of two factors . one could be due to decision making and the other due to defect in the art of writing prescriptions . the factors related to the former could be inappropriate prescription , irrational prescription , under prescribing , or over prescribing . the illegibility of the prescription or omission of any of the details in a prescription order could result in misinterpretation and medication errors . a good prescription should be legible and possess all the essential information necessary for the pharmacist to dispense and the patient to follow in such a way to avoid possible errors and thereby the complications introduced by such defaults . although prescription writing is a part of the medical students ' curriculum , their prescribing skills are still poor either as a part of their examinations or as they go out as qualified health professionals . although many prescribing errors are unintentional , studies have shown that the prescribing performance of interns and medical students are poor partly because of inadequate training . furthermore , studies reveal that many medical graduates feel under - prepared to take on prescribing responsibilities after graduation even though prescription writing is taught by lectures or case - based teaching . educational interventions such as problem - based tutorials , interactive electronic tutorials , teaching sessions based on who prescribing guide , case scenario - based methods , etc . , have been tried by researchers to improve the skill . however , most of the trials failed to provide a definitive answer and a strong evidence to support the use of above interventions . patient - based teaching is one of the educational interventions to teach clinical skills using real patients . this offers lifelike preparation and has more relevance to the trainee s future , i.e. , their day - to - day performance as a doctor . this intervention may improve prescribing skills since the learning occurs within the context of real patients and is easier to recall . based on the above facts , this study was conducted to determine the role of educational intervention ( patient - based teaching ) to improve the prescribing skill of ii year medical students . this prospective comparative study was done in a tertiary care medical college after obtaining permission from the institutional ethics committee . as this is a pilot study in its aspect to test a newer intervention , we decided to select a small sample size . two groups of 25 students were selected randomly from ii mbbs to participate in this study . the control group included all the 25 students who were posted to surgery postings and the test group included whole of the 25 students who were posted in general medicine department . written informed consent was obtained from the participants and permission obtained from the heads of the concerned departments . both groups of students ( n = 50 ) participating in the study were given general introduction about prescription writing , prescribing format and the who guidelines for selecting the preferred drug after making clinical diagnosis . five common clinical conditions were chosen for teaching prescription writing to both the groups ( peptic ulcer , bronchial asthma , new case of hypertension and diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism ) . the participants of the test group were subjected to patient - based teaching which was carried out in the general medicine department of our hospital exposing the students of test group to real patients suffering from the above mentioned clinical conditions . after briefing about clinical conditions and appropriate prescriptions , students were given 10 min duration to interact with patients . students of control group were trained on prescription writing by explaining five clinical conditions using case scenarios in the department of pharmacology . after allowing the participants of both the groups to undergo self - study for 2 days , they were asked to write prescriptions in the standard format for the same five clinical conditions discussed . then , assessment of their prescribing skill was done by analyzing scores obtained [ figure 1 ] . to prevent teaching and evaluation biases , teaching for both the groups were done by the first author , evaluation by the second author and providing dummy numbers to prescriptions of the students of both the groups . scoring for the prescriptions written by all the participants was done by a modified 14-point scoring format . the mean scores obtained by both the groups for the five prescriptions were analyzed using unpaired t - test and the individual parameters in the 14-point score were compared by chi - square test . an open - ended feedback was obtained from the test group students who were exposed to the newer educational intervention [ figure 1 ] . the five prescriptions written by each student were scored and the average obtained for each student and the mean score calculated for both the study groups . the mean score for the five prescriptions obtained by the students in control group ( by 14-point score ) was 9.6 and that of the test group was 12.04 [ figure 2 ] . comparison of mean score of both groups on comparison of the mean score obtained by both the group of students by unpaired student s t - test , there was a significant difference between both the groups ( p < 0.001 ) . the performance of students in both the groups with regard to the individual parameters of the 14-point score was also assessed . a total of 125 prescriptions obtained from each group were compared for the individual components of the score by chi - square test . there was a significant difference between groups in writing the doctor s particulars , patient particulars , diagnosis , quantity of the drugs and duration of medications to be taken , follow - up particulars and doctor s signature . there was no obvious difference noted in mentioning the parameters such as patient name , doctor name , drug name , dosage , and date of prescription [ table 1 ] . comparison of individual parameters on 14-point scoring on consolidating the open - ended feedback from all students of test group , they concisely opined that patient - based teaching was more interesting and motivating , gave more focus , they felt more responsible , felt empathic toward patients , and this way of teaching made them to remember the subject easily . prescriptions are orders that are issued to communicate between the prescriber and the patient or pharmacist . case - based teaching is an established method of teaching prescription writing to ii mbbs students since it provides student motivation , activates self - directed learning and imparts deeper knowledge . however , a review by koh et al . reveals that such type of teaching methods would not be much fruitful for skills such as prescribing , patient education , and doing procedures . furthermore , in the upcoming competency - based medical education , there is emphasis on teaching clinical skills and the assessment at the performance level . hence , it is essential to introduce better educational interventions which would give a lifelike experience while learning that could improve the prescribing confidence of undergraduate students . this study based on the above facts identifies the usefulness of patient - based teaching of prescriptions to medical students . the performance of students after patient - based teaching is significantly more than those who were trained by case based teaching ( p < 0.001 ) . there are studies to mention about the marked weakness of newly graduating medical students regarding prescribing skill . a study done in nigeria among final year students found that the students possess only knowledge about drugs , but their prescribing skills do not match the knowledge insisting on a more practice - based teaching of prescription writing . the analysis of the individual parameters of the 14-point score between both groups showed no significant difference invariables such as mentioning the doctor s name , patient s name , date of prescription , the drug name , and its strength . this shows that the students were able to memorize the drug information and reproduce it in both methods of teaching . on contrary , there was a significant difference noted between the groups in fulfilling the following parameters ( patient address , age / sex , doctor s address , degree , registration number , diagnosis , directions for use and signature - p < 0.001 and quantity / duration - p < 0.05 ) . this proves the fact that the patient based teaching offers more impact on writing complete prescriptions than the traditional case - based teaching . every element in the prescribing format is absolutely important and essential for both legal and therapeutic requirements . the study proves this lacuna of the current teaching of prescriptions which is drug centered rather than practice centered to offer the complete skill of prescribing . in patient - based teaching , the students have added advantages of communicating with patients , visualizing their agony and giving follow - up advice to them . these advantages help the students to gain real - life experience which enhances their memory and performance in prescription writing . feedback obtained from students also brought out the fact that the patient - based teaching improves their learning , motivation , and makes them to remember all the essential components of the prescribing format . apart from these , this method also provides better attitude of students toward patients and make them more empathic . most of the studies on educational interventions to improve prescriptions used objective structured clinical examination ( osce ) as assessment method ( at performance / does level of miller s pyramid ) . in this study , since the control group was not exposed to patients , instead of osce , the scoring system was used for assessment ( at the knows how level ) and the students were evaluated for prescribing competence rather than prescribing performance . the limitations expected with this newer intervention in teaching prescription writing are the difficulty in organization for a larger group of students and the availability of adequate faculty . studies with longer duration can check the long term memory of students . furthermore , before and after studies of patient - based teaching with osce as scoring would very well assess the communication skill of students also which offers holistic approach to prescribing skill . patient - based approach for prescription writing enables students to develop prescribing skills in a complete and professional way along with adequate medical knowledge . the use of real patients in teaching prescription writing should be considered more widely , as it provides strong contextualization and more relevance to learning .","background : although prescription writing is a part of the medical students ' curriculum , their prescribing skills are still poor either as a part of their examinations or as they go out as qualified health professionals which may be due to inadequate training . 
 educational intervention like patient - based teaching in pharmacology offers lifelike preparation and provides more relevance , easier recall , and help in improving prescribing skills . 
 this study aims to determine the role of patient - based teaching in improving the prescribing skill of ii year medical students compared to conventional case - based teaching.materials and methods : this prospective , comparative study was carried out after giving orientation to prescription writing as per the who prescribing guidelines ( n = 50 ) . 
 the 25 students in control group were given case - based teaching and 25 students in test group were given patient - based teaching of prescription writing for the same five common clinical conditions . 
 the prescription writing skill ( knows how level ) was assessed by evaluating the prescriptions written in the prescribed format and scored by a 14-point scoring system.results:the mean scores obtained by the control ( 9.6 ) and test ( 12.04 ) groups were compared by unpaired student s t - test ( p < 0.001 ) 
 . on comparing the individual parameters in the 14-point scoring by chi - square test , significant difference was found regarding patient and doctor s particulars , diagnosis , quantity , duration of therapy , and signature between study groups . 
 student feedback revealed that patient - based teaching enhanced responsibility , focus , and memory.conclusion:patient-based approach for prescription writing enables students to develop prescribing skills in a complete and professional way .",329
"historically , among various cultures , weight gain has been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity but as the dynamics of food production and consumption have changed , the world now faces an epidemic of obesity . according to the world health organization ( who ) , worldwide prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980 with estimated 1.5 billion adults with obesity in 2008 . in the united states , more than 64% of the population is overweight ( bmi  25  kg / m ) , and more than 33% of the adult population meets criteria for obesity ( bmi  30  kg / m ) . on a similar note , more than 25 million us adults have type 2 diabetes mellitus , and this figure will likely reach 50 million by 2050 given the current demographic trends and continued progression of obesity [ 3 , 4 ] . the increasing worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity has projected concerns for increasing burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . the dangers of obesity in adults and children have received more attention than ever in the recent years as more research data becomes available regarding the long - term health outcomes . the increasing rates of diabetes in children and adolescents and the limited capacity of the current therapeutic treatments to slow the disease progression raise the concern for a full blown diabetes tsunami for the generations to come . weight loss in obese and overweight subjects can be induced via intensive lifestyle modifications , medications , and/or bariatric surgery . these methods have been shown to confer overall health benefits ; however , their effect on remission of preexisting diabetes mellitus and reduction in cardiovascular risk has been variable . recent research data has offered a much better understanding of the pathophysiology and outcomes of these management strategies in obese patients . in this paper , the authors have summarized the results of major studies on remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduction of cardiovascular events by weight loss induced by different methods . furthermore , the paper aims to clarify various prevailing myths and practice patterns about obesity management among clinicians . in preparation for this paper , several online search engines were used to gather journal articles that focused on studying the efficacy of surgical weight loss as compared to the conventional medical therapies and intensive lifestyle modifications . an initial advanced literature search was conducted by pubmed and medline using a combination of key words that included epidemiology ,   obesity ,   weight loss ,   diabetes mellitus ,  and  bariatric surgery  which yielded 831 articles . furthermore , an individual screening of the articles was conducted for prospective , randomized , and controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of surgical versus medical / lifestyle intervention for weight loss and long - term cardiovascular and diabetes outcomes . also , the cochrane collaborative database was utilized to obtain articles on the latest information on weight loss and its effects on cardiovascular risk . to write our paper , we finally selected 56 articles , based on the study design and power , which were relevant to our current discussion . studies referred were original research , both prospective and retrospective controlled studies , and three large meta - analyses . the current review aims to draw evidence based conclusions , utilizing the latest research data , which can be utilized to guide the treatment of the obese diabetic patient population . recent data has suggested that diabetes mellitus may be reversed or prevented with weight loss strategies in obesity [ 4 , 6 ] . the exact definition of diabetes remission remains an area of debate ; however , the american diabetes association ( ada ) currently defines this as the achievement of euglycemia without pharmacological treatment for at least 1 year . partial diabetes remission is defined as a transition from meeting diabetes criteria to a prediabetes glycemia level ( i.e. , fasting plasma glucose of 100126  mg / dl and hba1c of 5.76.5% ) and complete diabetes remission as the transition from diabetes criteria to full glucose normalization ( i.e. , fasting plasma glucose < 100  mg / dl and hba1c < 5.7% ) . although this is a good operational definition , according to glycemic and pharmacological criteria , it does not account the underlying beta - cell function and insulin action and thus may be inappropriate to define a cure of diabetes . the most recently published data from the look ahead trial showed that the intensive lifestyle intervention ( ili ) is superior to conventional diabetes education in inducing weight loss and partial or complete remission of diabetes mellitus . ili included weekly group and individual counseling in the first 6 months , followed by 3 sessions per month for the second 6 months and twice - monthly contact and regular refresher group series and campaigns for 3 years . the ili aimed to limit total caloric intake to 1200 to 1800  kcal / d through reductions in total and saturated fat intake and by increasing physical activity levels to a goal of 175  min / wk . participants in the conventional diabetes education were offered 3 group sessions each year focusing on diet , physical activity , and social support . at 2 , 3 , and 4 years , respectively , 9.2% , 6.4% , and 3.5% of intensive lifestyle intervention participants ( n = 2262 ) had partial diabetes remission compared with 1.7% , 1.3% , and 0.5% of participants in the diabetes support and education group ( n = 2241 ) . complete remission was ; however , rare : 1.3% and 0.7% at 1 and 4 years . participants with early stage diabetes ( shortest duration , not treated with insulin , good baseline glycemic control ) were the most to benefit from ili . furthermore , the study also showed that ili leads to significant improvements in other health indicators , such as body weight , fitness , blood pressure , glycemic control , and lipids . despite improvements in risk factor profiles , ili did not result in decrease of cardiovascular events ( nonfatal myocardial infarction , hospitalization for angina , nonfatal stroke , or death ) compared to conventional diabetes education and therapy . as the primary end point was not met , it led to premature termination of the look ahead trial . the results of the look ahead trial are somewhat similar to action in diabetes and vascular disease ( advance ) trial , action to control cardiovascular disease in diabetes ( accord ) trial , and veterans affairs diabetes trial ( vadt ) . in these trials , intensive medical / antiglycemic therapy did not show any cardiovascular benefit despite better diabetes control and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors . in the accord trial , the mortality rate was about 19% higher in the intensive glucose management group as compared to standard glucose management group [ 1113 ] . nevertheless , it should be noted that most patients in the accord , advance , and vadt trials had longstanding diabetes with preexisting overt cardiovascular disease . in contrast to these studies , intensive antiglycemic therapy in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics ( ukpds study ) without overt coronary heart disease resulted in reduction in coronary events . nonetheless , the effect on cardiovascular risk reduction became apparent after several years of treatment . one may argue that the results of the look ahead trial could be similar to the ukpds study with longer followup , but the results could have been affected by the use of statins and medical therapy including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in both the study groups . orlistat leads to about 3  kg weight loss ; however , no reduction in cardiovascular events has been shown despite the weight loss and improvement in diabetes mellitus and lipid parameters . sibutramine use has been linked to increased number of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke despite weight loss , and for this reason , sibutramine was withdrawn from the market in october 2010 . two other studies , the ukpds and steno trials , reported important findings in regards to reduction in cardiovascular events with better diabetes control . the open , parallel steno trial studied a composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , revascularization and amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes . the study concluded that a focused multifactorial intervention that includes pharmacological therapy along with behavior modification and aspirin therapy decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease and the overall levels of glycosylated hemoglobin , blood pressure , cholesterol , and triglycerides levels as well as urinary albumin excretion . interestingly , the 13-year followup to the steno trial ( steno-2 ) did not reveal any significant weight loss in either study groups despite the sustained reduction in cardiovascular events in the intensive therapy group posing a question for whether weight loss plays a key role in cardiovascular risk reduction . the study showed a 50% overall risk reduction in cardiovascular and microvascular events with the implementation of the intensive multifactorial treatment . the ukpds trial on the other hand , randomly assigned 4209 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes to either conventional therapy ( dietary restriction ) or intensive therapy ( sulfonylurea or insulin or in obese subjects metformin ) . the study 's 10-year followup concluded that despite the loss of glycemic differences between the two groups , a continued reduction in microvascular risk and an overall risk reduction for myocardial infarction and death from any cause were observed . a summary of the main findings of various research studies is enclosed in table 1 , whereas table 2 gives a summary of the baseline characteristics of the study participants for the accord , ukpds , look ahead , vadt , and advance trials . there is increasing evidence that bariatric surgery is more effective than medical or lifestyle interventions for weight loss , reduction in cardiovascular risk , and diabetes remission . the reduction in comorbidities by bariatric surgery appears to translate into a 29% mortality reduction rate [ 19 , 20 ] . a large cohort study of nearly 8000 patients who had undergone roux - en - y surgery was matched to a similar sized cohort . in this study the patients with roux - en - y had a reduction of all - cause mortality by 40% , diabetes - related mortality by 92% , coronary artery disease related mortality by 56% , and mortality from cancers by 60% . a large meta - analysis published in 2009 based on the results of 621 studies ( from 1990 to 2006 ) reported that average weight loss by a bariatric surgery was about 38.5  kg or 55.9% excess body weight loss . overall , 78.1% of diabetes patients had complete resolution and diabetes was improved or resolved in about 86.6% of the patients . weight loss and diabetes resolution were found to be the greatest for patients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion / duodenal switch , followed by gastric bypass , and the least with banding procedure . in a recent analysis of severely obese patients with diabetes , the adjusted probability of initial remission of diabetes mellitus was found to be 12-to-24-fold greater for patients who underwent bariatric surgery than for those who underwent medical care alone . bariatric subjects also experienced lower relapse rates of diabetes compared to the nonsurgical subjects and without higher risk of death . another large multisite retrospective cohort study of adults with uncontrolled or medication - controlled type 2 diabetes who underwent gastric bypass reported that 68% patients experienced an initial complete diabetes remission within 5 years after surgery , of which 35% redeveloped diabetes within 5 years . significant negative predictors of diabetes remission were poor preoperative glycemic control , insulin use , and longer diabetes duration . weight trajectories after surgery were significantly different for never remitters , relapsers , and durable remitters . recently reported the results of a prospective study which gathered data 6 years after roux - en - y gastric bypass ( rygb ) surgery and aimed to examine the association of the surgery with weight loss , diabetes mellitus , and other health risks . they found that remission of type 2 diabetes was significantly more common among patients who underwent rygb ( 62% ) than among severely obese subjects with diabetes who initially sought but did not undergo bariatric surgery ( 6% ) and those who never sought bariatric surgery ( 8% ) . the swedish obese subjects ( sos ) study is an ongoing , nonrandomized , controlled , prospective , and matched study conducted at 25 public surgical departments and 480 primary health care centers in sweden of 2010 obese participants who underwent bariatric surgery and 2037 contemporaneously matched obese controls who received usual care . published the 2-year and 10-year follow - up results of sos study in 2004 where they found that after two years , the weight had increased by 0.1 percent in the control group and had decreased by 23.4 percent in the surgery group ( p < 0.001 ) and after 10 years , the weight had increased by 1.6 percent in the control group and decreased by 16.1 percent in the surgery group ( p < 0.001 ) . energy intake was lower and the proportion of physically active subjects higher in the surgery group than in the control group throughout the observation period . two- and 10-year rates of recovery from diabetes , hypertriglyceridemia , low levels of high - density lipoprotein cholesterol , hypertension , and hyperuricemia were more favorable in the surgery group than in the control group , whereas recovery from hypercholesterolemia did not differ between the groups . the surgery group had lower 2- and 10-year incidence rates of diabetes , hypertriglyceridemia , and hyperuricemia than those of the control group ; differences between the groups in the incidence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension were ; however , undetectable . published another followup results of the sos study in 2012 where they reported that bariatric surgery was associated with reduced incidence of fatal and total cardiovascular events , myocardial infarction and stroke even after the adjustment of baseline conditions ( adjusted hazard ratio of 0.47 ; 95% ci 0.290.76 ; p = 0.002 for all cardiovascular deaths and adjusted hazard ratio of 0.67 ; 95% ci 0.540.83 ; p < 0.001 for all first time fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events ) .   another prospective , nonrandomized , and controlled one year clinical trial aimed to compare the effects of roux - en - y gastric bypass surgery and comprehensive lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes and obesity - related cardiovascular risk factors reported mean one - year weight loss of 30% and 8% respectively in the surgical and medical intervention groups . beneficial effects on glucose metabolism , blood pressure , lipids , and low - grade inflammation were observed in both groups . remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in the surgery group than the lifestyle intervention group ; 70 versus 33% , p = 0.027 , and 49 versus 23% , p = 0.016 . the surgery group experienced a significantly greater reduction in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome , albuminuria , and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy than the lifestyle group . gastrointestinal symptoms and symptomatic postprandial hypoglycemia developed more frequently after gastric bypass surgery than after lifestyle intervention , though mortality in either group was not significantly different . one very recent prospective , randomized , and nonblinded clinical trial with one - year follow - up period , performed at the cleveland clinic , evaluated the efficacy of intensive medical therapy alone versus medical therapy combined with roux - en - y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in 150 obese patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and reported hba1c reduction to 6% in 12% patients receiving medical therapy versus 42% in gastric - bypass group and 37% in sleeve - gastrectomy group . weight loss and improvement in insulin resistance was significantly higher in both the surgical groups than in medical therapy only group . the use of drugs to lower glucose , lipid , and blood - pressure levels decreased significantly after both surgical procedures but increased in patients receiving medical therapy only . conducted a single - center , nonblinded , randomized , and controlled trial comparing the efficacy of roux - en - y gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion versus medical therapy for the remission of diabetes mellitus in morbidly obese diabetic patients . at 2 years , diabetes remission occurred in no patients in the medical - therapy group versus 75% in the gastric - bypass group and 95% in the biliopancreatic - diversion group ( p < 0.001 ) . age , sex , baseline bmi , duration of diabetes , and weight changes were not significant predictors of diabetes remission or of improvement in glycemia . though the average baseline glycated hemoglobin level had decreased in all groups , patients in both the surgical groups had greater degree of glycemia improvement than those of medical therapy group , the greatest improvement to have noted in the biliopancreatic - diversion group . though previous studies have offered a strong evidence of benefit of bariatric surgery in patients with a bmi > 40 kg / m , the benefits in patients with a lower bmi obese patients , that is , mild ( bmi = 3035  kg / m ) or moderate obesity ( bmi = 3540 current indications of bariatric surgery in obese patients as defined by the national institute of health are : bmi > 40  kg / m or bmi > 35  kg / m associated with serious comorbidities like diabetes , sleep apnea , obesity - related cardiomyopathy , or severe joint disease . however , recent data also suggests benefit of bariatric surgery in mild and moderate obesity patients . a recent prospective study compared the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( lsg ) versus medical therapy on patients with type 2 dm and a bmi of < 35  kg / m and reported diabetes mellitus and hypertension remission rate of 88.8% ( 8 of 9 patients ) without undesirable excessive weight loss as compared to none of the patients ( 0 of 9 patients ) undergoing remission in the medical therapy group . another prospective , consecutive , and nonrandomized trial of 79 patients investigate the role of sleeve gastrectomy for patients with class i obesity ( bmi 3035  kg / m ) and reported promising early weight loss and quality of life improvement in patients . one of the largest , prospective randomized trials published to date studying the long - term impacts of rygb ( followup being 6 years ) on patients with diabetes and only class i obesity reported durable diabetes remission occurred in 88% of cases , with glycemic improvement in 11% . mean hba1c fell from 9.7  1.5 to 5.9  0.1% ( p < 0.001 ) , despite diabetes medication cessation in the majority . weight loss failed to correlate with several measures of improved glucose homeostasis , consistent with weight - independent antidiabetes mechanisms of rygb . hypertension and dyslipidemia also improved , yielding 5084% reductions in predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risks of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and stroke . in addition , post hoc study findings reported by sjstrm et al . demonstrated that a higher baseline bmi may not be associated with a greater benefit of bariatric surgery . other important comorbidities that deserve to be mentioned in this paper are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) and non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) as they may frequently be considered a part of the metabolic syndrome ( insulin resistance ) . some studies have reported improvement in nafld , adipokines ( used to measure fatty liver disease ) , and insulin resistance after weight loss with bariatric surgery [ 36 , 37 ] . however , randomized trials to confirm these findings are lacking and thus use of surgical approach for these conditions remains controversial . though our current discussion mainly focuses on the review and comparison of effectiveness of medical versus surgical weight loss strategies ; however , we wanted to mention here the results of another most recent randomized trial which showed that the use of mediterranean diet results in the reduction of major cardiovascular events especially in obese patient population . this study mainly compared the cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving mediterranean diet versus those receiving regular controlled diet . none of the study patients were advised either total calorie restriction or promotion of physical activity . the effects of mediterranean diet on the weight / bmi were also not the major focus of this study . to best of our knowledge , this study is the first largest prospective study which showed significant cardiovascular risk reduction in obese patients with the use of mediterranean diet and thus this opens up a consideration for recommending the use of this dietary lifestyle intervention which may potentially reduce cardiovascular risk in obese patients . look ahead trial , the largest prospective trial comparing efficacy of ili with standard diabetes education and management ( sde ) in obese diabetics , failed to show any additive benefit of ili over sde in the improvement of cardiovascular outcomes despite an observed improvement in weight loss , body fitness , and diabetes remission . complete diabetes remission with ili was rare , but partial diabetes remission even though significant in the initial years was not long lasting . partial diabetes remission with ili was most effectively achieved in patients with short duration diabetes history , who have lower hba1c levels and those who do not yet require insulin therapy , suggesting that emphasis on early diabetes screening and probably intensive / aggressive management in the early course of the disease warrants more attention . some prior studies of medication based therapy have shown that reductions in hba1c and fasting glucose , if sustained , are likely to considerably reduce the risks of microvascular complications [ 40 , 41 ] . one could argue that failure of demonstrating any benefit in the cardiovascular outcomes with ili in the look ahead trial could be because of improved cardiovascular risk factor control in both the study groups through medical treatment , improved clinical care after acute cardiovascular events , enrollment of a healthier - than - expected patient cohort and excluding patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk factors . however , based on the current evidence , intensive medical therapy alone does not appear to be very promising in improving cardiovascular outcomes or producing long - term diabetes remission . in contrast to weight loss by medications or intensive lifestyle modification , bariatric surgery has shown to be very effective in improving cardiovascular health and in producing diabetes remission in obese diabetic patients by the majority of both long - term and short - term cohort and prospective studies . although one may assume that the degree of postoperative weight loss might be the major driver for improvement in diabetes mellitus in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery , the weight loss and type 2 diabetes are often not in a direct cause - and - effect relationship . the improvement of diabetes mellitus occurs within days after gastric bypass , before there is significant weight loss [ 4244 ] . these findings suggest that bariatric surgeries may affect the diabetes course independent of the weight . suggested that changes in the gut hormonal milieu after bypass of the distal stomach , duodenum , and proximal jejunum can influence the mechanism of type 2 diabetes . other mechanisms involved may be changes in neurohumoral regulation , increased expression of glucose transporter type 4 ( glut4 ) , and normalization of whole - body insulin resistance . though bmi is still the most widely used criteria for selection of patients for bariatric surgery in clinical practice , this practice pattern may change as the recent data shows significant benefit of bariatric surgery in mild and moderately obese patients . also , one study findings suggested that high insulin levels may be a better selection criterion for bariatric surgery than high bmi , as far as cardiovascular events are concerned . as seen with intensive lifestyle treatment , patients with early stage diabetes appeared to benefit most from bariatric surgery ; so a strong argument can be made for considering earlier surgical intervention in moderately obese patients ( body mass index  30 ) with early stage diabetes . at the same time , offering bariatric surgery to every obese diabetic individual may impose serious practical concerns which include nonbenign nature of the surgical intervention ( including some associated long - term mechanical and nutritional complications ) , nonsustained beneficial long - term effects , as shown by holman et al .   and arterburn et al . , and significant increase in the nationwide healthcare burden related to the cost of intervention . i should advise my obese diabetic patients to follow intensive dietary and exercise ( lifestyle ) interventions as this would decrease their cardiovascular risk as compared to routine interventions and medical therapy this is the most common myth which prevails among clinicians , may it be general internists or cardiologists . though this statement sounds very conceptual , the prospective studies have jolted this prevailing belief as intensive lifestyle interventions have not shown to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients despite improvement in other health indicators like weight loss , body fitness and diabetes remission . though with that being said , data in these studies have their own limitations as discussed earlier and the authors feel it should not preclude clinicians from advising their patients to adopt healthier lifestyle measures including intensive lifestyle interventions for management of diabetes in obesity . poorly controlled diabetics with a long standing history of disease are most likely to benefit from intensive lifestyle therapy for their diabetes control or remission as we discussed earlier , data from prospective studies have shown that newly diagnosed diabetics or diabetics with better glycemic control are in fact more likely to achieve a partial or transient complete diabetes remission with intensive lifestyle modification and medical therapy , as compared to patients with long standing history of disease . bariatric surgery is more effective than medical management in inducing diabetes remission because it induces rapid and more weight loss the improvement of diabetes mellitus occurs within days after gastric bypass , before there is significant weight loss . changes in the gut hormonal milieu after gastric bypass , changes in neurohumoral regulation , and normalization of whole body insulin resistance have been proposed to be additional mechanisms providing therapeutic benefit . weight loss strategies in obesity should include setting of realistic goals because otherwise patients will become frustrated and lose less weight . 

 answer . although this sounds a very reasonable concept , several studies have offered contrasting data and support that more ambitious goals are associated with better weight - loss outcomes [ 47 , 48 ] . study results were more supportive of the idea that higher goals motivate patients to lose more weight than of the hypothesis that high goals undermine effort . large amount and rapid weight loss is associated with poorer long - term outcomes , as compared with slow , gradual weight loss this belief probably emerged over five decades ago in reaction to the adverse effects of nutritionally insufficient very - low - calorie diets ( < 800  kcal per day ) and has persisted to the extent that it may be common advise by many regular dieticians . in several prospective trials , patients often undergo more rapid and greater initial weight loss and this has been associated with lower body weight at the end of long - term followup . some obese persons have a greater initial weight loss than others do due to unclear reasons , thus a recommendation to lose weight more slowly might interfere with the ultimate success of weight - loss efforts . people often may feel that they spend a lot of energy ( about 100300  kcal ) while indulging in one sexual intercourse . studies have shown that an average bout of sexual activity lasting for about 6 minutes approximately expends only 21  kcal . breastfeeding has been advocated to offer a protective benefit against the development of childhood obesity , for a long time . the incidence of type 1 diabetes is reduced by 30% in infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months . a reduction of 40% in type 2 diabetes also is reported , possibly reflecting the long - term positive effect of breastfeeding on weight control and feeding self - regulation . however , more recent data from prospective randomized controlled studies do not support the theory of antiobesity effects of breast milk to the children [ 5355 ] . dietary or behavioral modifications are not going to work , so why even bother  ? identification of key environmental factors and then successful interventions can achieve clinically significant reductions in obesity . bariatric surgery offers benefits only in patients with bmi > 40 or bmi > 35 with associated severe comorbidities . 
 answer . though bmi is still the most widely used criteria for selection of patients for bariatric surgery in clinical practice , this practice pattern may change as the recent data from multiple studies shows significant benefit of bariatric surgery in mild and moderate obese patients . i should advise my obese diabetic patients to follow intensive dietary and exercise ( lifestyle ) interventions as this would decrease their cardiovascular risk as compared to routine interventions and medical therapy . this is the most common myth which prevails among clinicians , may it be general internists or cardiologists . though this statement sounds very conceptual , the prospective studies have jolted this prevailing belief as intensive lifestyle interventions have not shown to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients despite improvement in other health indicators like weight loss , body fitness and diabetes remission . though with that being said , data in these studies have their own limitations as discussed earlier and the authors feel it should not preclude clinicians from advising their patients to adopt healthier lifestyle measures including intensive lifestyle interventions for management of diabetes in obesity . poorly controlled diabetics with a long standing history of disease are most likely to benefit from intensive lifestyle therapy for their diabetes control or remission , data from prospective studies have shown that newly diagnosed diabetics or diabetics with better glycemic control are in fact more likely to achieve a partial or transient complete diabetes remission with intensive lifestyle modification and medical therapy , as compared to patients with long standing history of disease . bariatric surgery is more effective than medical management in inducing diabetes remission because it induces rapid and more weight loss .

 answer . though bmi is still the most widely used criteria for selection of patients for bariatric surgery in clinical practice , this practice pattern may change as the recent data from multiple studies shows significant benefit of bariatric surgery in mild and moderate obese patients . the association of diabetes mellitus , obesity , and cardiovascular risk factors is very complex . recent research data certainly provides a better understanding ; however , many pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with the benefits of medical and surgical interventions remain poorly understood . clinical education , research , and health policies need to increase their focus towards primary prevention of risk factors associated with diabetes mellitus and obesity especially in children and adolescents who are deemed to be at high risk . though ili did not appear to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events significantly in prospective studies , the authors feel that it should be recommended to all the patients given the absence of long - term follow - up data and significant health benefits achieved in a subset of patients . several myths prevail regarding obesity not only among general population but also among clinicians which may affect practice patterns . more education among the patients and general clinicians may produce better healthcare outcomes in obese subjects.bariatric surgery certainly appears to have an emerging and promising future role in the management of cardiac risk factors and diabetes remission in obese diabetic patients , especially in the subset of the newly diagnosed diabetics in this patient population . furthermore , bariatric surgical intervention has also shown some promising outcomes in the less severely obese patient population who have high cardiovascular risk factors . however , appropriate selection criteria need a consensus opinion involving possible reformulation of the existing guidelines . the association of diabetes mellitus , obesity , and cardiovascular risk factors is very complex . recent research data certainly provides a better understanding ; however , many pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with the benefits of medical and surgical interventions remain poorly understood . future long - term prospective studies are warranted for a better clinical decision making . clinical education , research , and health policies need to increase their focus towards primary prevention of risk factors associated with diabetes mellitus and obesity especially in children and adolescents who are deemed to be at high risk . though ili did not appear to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events significantly in prospective studies , the authors feel that it should be recommended to all the patients given the absence of long - term follow - up data and significant health benefits achieved in a subset of patients . several myths prevail regarding obesity not only among general population but also among clinicians which may affect practice patterns . more education among the patients and general clinicians may produce better healthcare outcomes in obese subjects . bariatric surgery certainly appears to have an emerging and promising future role in the management of cardiac risk factors and diabetes remission in obese diabetic patients , especially in the subset of the newly diagnosed diabetics in this patient population . furthermore , bariatric surgical intervention has also shown some promising outcomes in the less severely obese patient population who have high cardiovascular risk factors . however ,","the increasing worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity has projected concerns for increasing burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . 
 the dangers of obesity in adults and children have received more attention than ever in the recent years as more research data becomes available regarding the long - term health outcomes . 
 weight loss in obese and overweight subjects can be induced via intensive lifestyle modifications , medications , and/or bariatric surgery . 
 these methods have been shown to confer overall health benefits ; however , their effect on remission of preexisting diabetes mellitus and reduction in cardiovascular risk has been variable . 
 recent research data has offered a much better understanding of the pathophysiology and outcomes of these management strategies in obese patients . in this paper , the authors have summarized the results of major studies on remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus and reduction of cardiovascular events by weight loss induced by different methods . 
 furthermore , the paper aims to clarify various prevailing myths and practice patterns about obesity management among clinicians .",190
"osteosarcoma ( os ) is a common histological form of bone cancer , which is most prevalent in children and adolescents . it was reported that os was the eighth most common childhood cancer , accounting for about 20% of all primary bone cancers and 2.4% of all malignancies in pediatric patients . symptoms include pain at night , overt localized swelling , and bones that fracture easily . various treatments , such as wide - excision surgery of tumors , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , and neoadjuvant chemotherapy , are usually adopted in os . although significant improvements in the long - term outcome of os patients have been made , it is still not satisfactory . the best reported 10-year survival rate was 92% , and the protocol was an aggressive intra - arterial regimen that individualizes therapy based on arteriographic response . the 3-year survival rates ranged from 5075% , and 5-year survival rate ranged from 6085% . in addition , 3040% children died of it , and 2550% patients subsequently developed metastatic disease , which was the major cause of death . recently , some biomarkers for os were selected , such as cd20 , ecm , itga , and pmp22 . hyperthermia therapy is a treatment approach in which a particular area or the whole body is heated above normal temperatures to achieve therapeutic effects . hyperthermia has been used in cancer treatment since 1989 , and currently it is used either for ablation purposes as an alternative to surgery , or , less frequently , in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy . it was reported that hyperthermia can activate various systemic anti - tumor immune responses , and leads to methamphetamine - induced toxicity . the principle may be as follows : heat alters membrane characteristics , leading to modification in cell morphology , intracellular sodium and calcium levels , and membrane potential [ 1517 ] . some studies reported that hyperthermia can induce apoptosis and reduce migration of os . in this study , we aimed to screen gene expression changes of os induced by hyperthermia via integrating the chromatin immunoprecipitation with generation sequencing ( chip - seq ) and targetscan analysis , and further explored the related potential biomarkers and mechanism . the chip - seq dataset of gse60984   was downloaded from the gene expressed omnibus ( geo ) database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) . in this dataset , there were 3 samples of os cell : one was treated with both anti - hsf1 antibody and heat shocked for 10 min , another was treated with anti - hsf1 antibody and was heat shocked for 20 min , and the last was treated with neither antibody nor hyperthermia ( the control sample ) . raw fastq read sequences were demultiplexed , and cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences from dna high - throughput sequencing data . afterwards , the expressed genes were aligned to a reference genome using bowtie , an ultrafast genome aligning tool that was used for the mapping of the raw reads to enesembl ( http://www.ensembl.org/index.html ) hg19 genome with maximum of 2 mismatches in every reads and those who had only 1 match were reserved . model - based analysis of chip - seq ( macs ) was a computational algorithm that identified genome - wide locations of transcription / chromatin factor binding or histone modification from chip - seq data . the hsf1-binding sites ( also known as peaks ) were respectively obtained via macs2 in the os cells heat shocked for 10 and 20 min compared with the control samples , and recorded as peek-10 and peek-20 , respectively . based on the chipseeker package , their related genes , distance to the closest transcription start sites ( tss ) , and genome features were assigned to the peaks . moreover , some genes of peek-10 and peek-20 were separately selected out when hsf1-binding sites were located in the promoter regions , and their overlaps were found . the database for annotation , visualization and integrated discovery ( david )   ( https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ ) is a widely used web - based tool for functional and pathway enrichment analysis . in this study it was used to perform gene ontology ( go ) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway enrichment analysis of the above overlaps . moreover , the go terms and kegg pathways were selected out with the criteria of p value < 0.05 . targetscan is a widely used database that predicts biological targets of mirnas by searching for the presence of conserved 8mer , 7mer , and 6mer sites that match the seed region of each mirna . the mirna , which might regulate the overlaps , as well as the mirna - gene pairs , were screened out with targetscan . furthermore , the mirna - gene - regulated network was constructed based on the above mirna - gene pairs . however , the selected mirna - gene pairs might be overwhelming , and the mirna - gene regulated network too complicated , so that it was not conducive to analyze and the accuracy was not high . hence , module analysis of the network was conducted and the modules were visualized using cytoscape software . the chip -

wide are shown in figure 1 , showing 10.017% peek-10 and 7.921% peek-20 located in the promoter regions . in other words , 1880 genes of peek-10 and 1283 genes of peek-20 were located in the promoter regions . besides , 889 overlaps of them were found , and 40 of the overlaps are shown in table 1 . a total of 122 go terms were found to be enriched in the overlapped genes , and the top 10 most significant go terms are exhibited in figure 2 . the overlaps were enriched in 3 kegg pathways , namely p53 signaling pathway , methane metabolism and viral myocarditis . the mirna - gene regulated network of the overlaps was constructed , including 13 657 mirna - gene - regulated pairs . the network was divided into 4 modules , and they were recorded as module 1 , module 2 , module 3 , and module 4 . a total of 19 626 and 18 015 hsf1-binding sites were obtained in the os cells heat shocked for 10 and 20 min , respectively , compared with the control samples ( recorded as peek-10 and peek-20 ) . their distributions in the genome - wide are shown in figure 1 , showing 10.017% peek-10 and 7.921% peek-20 located in the promoter regions . in other words , 1880 genes of peek-10 and 1283 genes of peek-20 were located in the promoter regions . besides , 889 overlaps of them were found , and 40 of the overlaps are shown in table 1 . a total of 122 go terms were found to be enriched in the overlapped genes , and the top 10 most significant go terms are exhibited in figure 2 . the overlaps were enriched in 3 kegg pathways , namely p53 signaling pathway , methane metabolism and viral myocarditis . the mirna - gene regulated network of the overlaps was constructed , including 13 657 mirna - gene - regulated pairs . the network was divided into 4 modules , and they were recorded as module 1 , module 2 , module 3 , and module 4 . heat shock transcription factor 1 ( hsf1 ) is localized to the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer , and heat shock can induce the activation of hsf1 . the active hsf1 leads to synthesis and cytoprotection of heat shock proteins ( hsps ) . however , an increase in hsps might render hyperthermia less effective . in this study , the hsf1 binding sites in promoter regions were analyzed after 10 and 20 min of hyperthermia using the chip - seq approach . after the functional enrichment analysis , more overlapped genes were enriched in processes of regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell death ( figure 2 ) . programmed cell death , especially the expressions of some receptors and ligands in the process , play critical roles in the progression and resistance to oncolytic adenovirus of os [ 3032 ] . regulations the cell death processes of tumor cells and normal cells has become an important way to increase efficacy and reduce resistance to traditional treatments in os [ 3335 ] . therefore , processes of programmed cell death and cell death might be involved in the mechanism of hyperthermia in os , and their rational regulation might contribute to a better curative effect . the overlaps were found enriched in 3 kegg pathways , p53 signaling pathway , methane metabolism , and viral myocarditis . the p53 signaling pathway was involved in many tumors , and os is no exception . it was reported that the p53 signaling pathway participates in cell proliferation , metastasis , and angiogenesis of os [ 3840 ] . furthermore , the p53 pathway is closely associated with cell cycle and apoptosis , which are involved in the enriched go terms used in this study [ 4143 ] . matsumoto et al .   found that nitric oxide is an initiator of intercellular signal transduction after hyperthermia in mutant p53 cells of human glioblastoma . our results indicate that the p53 signaling pathway , methane metabolism , and viral myocarditis might play critical roles in gene changes of os regulated by hsf1 . however , further in - depth research is needed , especially on the relationships between os and pathways of methane metabolism and viral myocarditis . after targetscan analysis of the overlaps , the mirna - gene - regulated network was constructed , including 13 657 mirna - gene regulated pairs that might be unreliable . module 1 contained the most nodes and pairs , and sgms2 and cggbp1 were regulated by more mirnas than other nodes . therefore , sgms2 and cggbp1 are important nodes in the mirna - gene - regulated network of the overlapped degs . sgms2 encoded sphingomyelin synthase 2 ( sgms2 ) , which is a risk factor of liver steatosis and atherosclerosis . moreover , nfb signaling pathways is closely related to the proliferation and progression mechanism of many cancers , and targeting it has been used in cancer prevention and therapy [ 4850 ] . cggbp1 encoded cgg triplet repeat - binding protein 1 ( cggbp1 ) , which is a nuclear and midbody protein regulating abscission . cell cycle directly affects cell proliferation and apoptosis , which is important in the progression and prognosis of os . although few studies have verified that sgms2 and cggbp1 are associated with effects of hyperthermia on os , the present study indicates that they might be key genes of os treated with heat shock . the gse60984 data set was provided by janus et al . , who mainly researched potential genes regulated by tnf- cytokine and heat shock based on chip - seq analysis , and explored functions of nf-b signaling pathways on os in the process of hyperthermia . in this article , some different methods were used and some novel findings were obtained . for example , functional and pathways enrichment analysis were performed , and some different biological processes ( e.g. , programmed cell death and cell death ) and more pathways ( e.g. , p53 signaling pathway , methane metabolism , and viral myocarditis ) were found to be involved in the effects of hyperthermia on os . moreover , the mirna - gene network was constructed and analyzed with targetscan and cytoscape , which contained more interactions and thus might be more reliable . sgms2 and cggbp1 might be biomarkers of heat shocked os , and programmed cell death and cell death might be involved in the mechanism of hyperthermia in os . the p53 signaling pathway , methane metabolism , and viral myocarditis might play critical roles in gene changes in os regulated by hsf1 .","backgroundthe purpose of this study was to research the effects of hyperthermia on osteosarcoma ( os ) by integrating the chromatin immunoprecipitation with the generation sequencing ( chip - seq ) and targetscan analysis of heat shock transcription factor 1 ( hsf1).material / methodsthe hsf1 chip - seq dataset of gse60984 was downloaded from the gene expressed omnibus ( geo ) database . 
 the hsf1-binding sites were screened by macs2 in os cells after 10 and 20 min of hyperthermia , and they were annotated using the chipseeker package . 
 the overlapped genes were selected out when hsf1-binding sites were located in the promoter region . 
 the database for annotation , visualization , and integrated discovery ( david ) was used to perform gene ontology ( go ) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway enrichment analysis of the overlaps . 
 the mirna - gene pairs of the overlaps were screened out via targetscan , and the mirna - gene - regulated network was constructed by cytoscape software.results1880 and 1283 genes of promoter regions were obtained in the osteosarcoma cells after 10 and 20 min of hyperthermia , respectively , and 889 of them were overlapped . 
 the overlapped genes were enriched in 122 go terms and 3 kegg pathways . 
 there were 13 657 pairs involved in the mirna - gene regulated network of the overlaps.conclusionssome biomarkers were identified for os treated with hyperthermia . moreover , some go terms ( regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell death ) and pathways ( p53 signaling pathway , methane metabolism , and viral myocarditis ) might be involved .",355
"a safe and efficient hemostasis is one of the most important factors in minimally invasive surgery . hemostasis can be achieved by sutures , clips , application of hemostyptica or thermic coagulation .   for thermic coagulation , high - frequency ( hf ) coagulation in monopolar or bipolar mode , cold plasma , and ultrasonic coagulation klingele compared the ultrasonic technique with the bipolar technique in dissected vessels and examined the tissue damage . underwood et al . measured the differences in operative time , blood loss and complications when using bipolar or ultrasonic technique in colectomies and fundoplications [ 7 , 8 ] . sutton   et al . examined the lateral thermal spread using monopolar and bipolar diathermy , the harmonic scalpel and ligasure by measuring the maximum temperature . in our present study the tests were performed on perfused , isolated pig liver in a minimally invasive model with a pulsatile organ perfusion ( p.o.p . ) trainer . for analysis a complete laparoscopic equipment setup for minimally invasive surgery was used together with a p.o.p . the experimental procedure began with heating the isolated , frozen liver in a water - cooled vacuum in order to warm it up to about 30c35c before the actual start of the experiment . the pump of the trainer was activated to check the correct function ( figure 2 ) . small open vessels on the liver surface were closed with sutures . after a final check of the correct connection of blood vessels , after 30 minutes , the tissue temperature was detected by the laboratory thermometer at 5-minute intervals until it reached 37c .   to start the experiment , a 2 - 3  cm thick slice of the liver was resected to create a deep tissue bleeding . after closure of the cover , the pump was activated again ; the bleeding area was photodocumented ( figure 3 ) . the cut surface was divided horizontally in two halves . only the upper half was coagulated to see the difference to untreated tissue and calculate the tissue loss ( figure 4 ) . the coagulation was started using one of the four techniques until the bleeding could be stopped .   using ultrasonic coagulation , it was not possible to create hemostasis in preliminary experiments for hemostasis   of large bleeding areas in perfused pig liver . after 5 minutes , the cell walls were highlighted and a first approach of coagulated tissue became visible . the bleeding did not stop ; the extraction of tissue by the mechanical vibrations of the ultrasonic applicator could be observed . after 10  minutes , there was an increase of foam ; after 15  minutes , we saw extracted tissue without sufficient hemostasis ( figures 5 and 6 ) . based on these preliminary tests , the ultrasonic technique was not considered for   further experiments and pathological examination .   using the other devices , after stopping the pump and opening the cover , the tissue was fixed on a cork plate and placed in formalin solution after photodocumentation .   from the resected tissue , 10  cuts in 510  mm distance were made , each cut was examined at 10 points microscopically ( figure 7 ) . furthermore , the maximum tissue damage was determined to compare the tissue loss caused by the different techniques . the high - frequency coagulation devices were used with the settings shown in table 1 . the gas flow had little effect ( cooling ) on the coagulation performance . with 1.5  l / min gas flow , forced coag  was chosen because the required output voltage of the monopolar technique for a similar coagulation is significantly higher than in bipolar technology . the tissue structure changes on the necrotic side the color is darker in the thermally damaged area . microscopically the necrotic cells are not clearly defined and shrank because of the evaporated water . in addition , the color is very dark compared with the nondamaged tissue . the 10 measuring points are lined up linearly , so that the measurements cover a distance of 1  mm of the tissue sample . the tissue loss is measured in relation to the lower half of the untreated sample at the point of greatest loss . the measurement can be easily carried out macroscopically ( figure 4 ) .   for statistical evaluation of tissue damage and tissue loss , we measured the coagulation time of 3  different techniques ( monopolar , bipolar , and cold plasma ) on 4 experimental days . ultrasonic coagulation was excluded , because hemostasis of large bleeding areas could not be reached .   as shown in figure 9 , the shortest time there was almost no difference between monopolar ( 11  min ) and cold plasma ( 11.25  min ) . to determine the tissue loss , the height difference between the coagulated area and the untreated area was macroscopically analyzed and measured in mm ( figure 10 ) . the minimal tissue loss was 4  mm ( bipolar coagulation ) ; the maximal tissue loss of 8  mm occurred using cold plasma coagulation . on average , the tissue loss was the least in bipolar technique ( 4.5  mm ) , more in monopolar technique ( 6.0  mm ) , and most in cold plasma coagulation ( 7.5  mm ) . the depth of tissue necrosis was analyzed microscopically and measured in mm ( figure 11 ) . the lowest value was found in cold plasma coagulation ( 0.157  mm ) , the highest in monopolar coagulation ( 0.598  mm ) . the slightest average damage to the tissue was observed in cold plasma coagulation with a mean of 0.264  mm . bipolar coagulation led to an average depth of 0.346  mm , monopolar coagulation of 0.459  mm . bipolar coagulation of large bleeding areas of the perfused pig liver led to a rapid   hemostasis causing moderate tissue damage and depth loss . the worst results occurred with monopolar coagulation compared to bipolar technique ( coagulation time + 33.3% , tissue loss + 33.3% , tissue damage + 32.7% ) . ultrasonic coagulation was excluded because large bleeding areas could not be treated sufficiently and hemostasis was not reached . the aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences between the common coagulation techniques in a minimally invasive model concerning the efficiency of hemostasis and local tissue damage [ 1 , 3 ] . the experiments were done with isolated , perfused pig livers . the use of ultrasonic coagulation did not lead to a complete hemostasis even after 15-minute coagulation time . the termination resulted from the application form of energy causing foam formation and extraction of tissue components . the benefits of ultrasonic technology in minimally invasive surgery are clear in the preparation and dissection of tissue , the use close to other organs , and the closure of isolated vessels of up to 57  mm . in our model , it was not useful for coagulation of large bleeding areas . the first parameter in this study was the coagulation time until a sufficient hemostasis was reached . a good instrument should be safe and quick to reduce damage to lateral tissue and to minimize the energy flow to the patient . we know from clinical use that with longer monopolar coagulation time more and more necrotic tissue sticks to the instrument and is pulled out . the average tissue loss was 4.5  mm in bipolar technique and 6.0  mm in monopolar technique ( cold plasma coagulation 7.5  mm ) . the depth of tissue damage by coagulation was the third parameter in this study . because of the high efficiency of bipolar coagulation , less energy was needed to stop the bleeding . this resulted in an average depth of tissue necrosis of 0.346  mm in bipolar coagulation and 0.459  mm in monopolar coagulation . it showed the longest coagulation time and the highest tissue loss , while the depth of tissue damage was the lowest in this study . one possible explanation could be the gas , which is pressed into the tissue during the contactless coagulation . it leads to a deep dissection of necrotic tissue and a rapid shrinkage of the particles ( figure 13 ) . this indicates a low degree of necrosis and corresponds with the previously mentioned results ( figure 14 ) . after monopolar coagulation , we regularly see black carbonized tissue ( figure 15 ) , after cold plasma coagulation grey - brown to black tissue ( figure 16 ) . in summary , the collateral tissue damage consisted of the tissue loss and the tissue necrosis in the depth . when both factors are added , the total damage can be calculated ( table 2 ) . the results of this work came from experiments on isolated pig livers in an in vitro test environment and can not be easily transferred to human application . perfusion of the isolated liver was achieved with colored saline solution and not with blood , what restricts hemostasis and prolongs the coagulation time . this is one reason for the relatively long coagulation time that we measured in the perfused liver . further studies have to show the presumed superiority of bipolar technique . in our surgical department the experimental study showed differences between several coagulation techniques in a minimally invasive model for hemostasis in deep liver bleeding . ultrasonic coagulation , which is very useful in dissection of tissue and coagulation of isolated vessels , did not lead to a sufficient hemostasis in large bleeding areas . the bipolar technique was the form of coagulation with the highest efficiency and the least tissue damage .","hemostasis in minimally invasive surgery causes tissue damage . regardless of the method of production of thermal energy , 
 a quick and safe coagulation is essential for its clinical use . in this study 
 we examined the tissue damage in the isolated perfused pig liver using monopolar , bipolar , cold plasma , and ultrasonic coagulation . in a 
 minimally invasive in vitro setup , a 2 - 3  cm slice of the edge of the perfused pig liver was resected . 
 after hemostasis was achieved , liver tissue of the coagulated area was given to histopathological examination . 
 the depth of tissue necrosis , the height of tissue loss , and the time until sufficient hemostasis was reached were analyzed . 
 the lowest risk for extensive tissue damage could be shown for the bipolar technique , combined with the highest efficiency in hemostasis . 
 using cold plasma , coagulation time was longer with a deeper tissue damage . 
 monopolar technique showed the worst results with the highest tissue damage and a long coagulation time . 
 ultrasonic coagulation was not useful for coagulation of large bleeding areas . 
 in summary , bipolar technique led to less tissue damage and best coagulation results in our minimally invasive model . 
 these results could be important to recommend bipolar coagulation for clinical use in minimally invasive surgery .",265
"rice ( oryza sativa ) is not only the most important staple food feeding a large part of the world population , but also an important model organism for biological studies of crops as well as other related plants ( 1,2 ) . for this reason , rice was chosen as the first crop for whole genome sequencing . the availability of genome sequences of the two most common cultivated rice subspecies , indica 93 - 11 and japonica nipponbare ( 3,4 ) , along with the resequencing of cultivated and wild rice accessions ( 5 ) , enables the in - depth characterization of rice genes ( 6 ) , exploration of agronomically important traits ( 7 ) and investigation of rice diversity and domestication ( 8) . however , building standardized rice reference genomes with comprehensive and accurate annotations remains a formidable challenge . , conducted manually by dedicated experts . to perform curation , expert curators often administer raw biological data , conduct a thorough literature search , extract essential information from multiple publications , curate the information using structured and controlled vocabularies and then submit the information to a knowledge database [ e.g. , the reference sequence database ( 11 ) at the national center for biotechnology information ] to make it public . however , with the exponentially exploding volume of rice knowledge and other relevant data , expert curation is becoming more laborious and time - consuming . keeping biological knowledge in expert - curated databases comprehensive , up - to - date and accurate is increasingly lagging behind knowledge creation , or worse , not being done at all in fields where insufficient funds can be allocated to curation ( 14 ) . simply put , although expert - curated databases have traditionally proven important for scientific research , they are struggling with the flood of knowledge . explosive growth in the volume of rice data requires a large number of people getting involved in knowledge curation , viz . community curation exploits the whole power of the scientific community for knowledge curation ( 1519 ) . a case in point that harnesses community intelligence in knowledge integration is wikipedia ( http://www.wikipedia.org ) . wikipedia is an online encyclopedia , allowing any user to create / edit any content . it features collaborative knowledge curation , up - to - date content , huge coverage and low cost for maintenance ( 20 ) . despite fears that the openness of editorial capacity could lead to incorporation of significant flawed content ( 21 ) , broad participation in wikipedia not only increases knowledge coverage and keeps knowledge up - to - date , but also improves knowledge accuracy (  with enough eyeballs , all bugs are shallow ; http://oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html ) . owing to the extraordinary success of wikipedia , it has been advocated that biological databases go wiki ( 23 ) . as a consequence , more than a dozen biological wikis ( 2442 ) have been constructed to exploit the full potential of the scientific community for knowledge curation , such as ecoliwiki for the model bacteria escherichia coli ( 27 ) , gene wiki for human gene annotation ( 28 ) and pdbwiki for protein structures ( 31 ) . to date , however , there is no community - curated resource for rice . to establish a platform for community integration of rice data and to facilitate efficient management of community knowledge on rice , here we develop ricewiki ( http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn ) , a wiki - based , publicly editable and open - content platform for community curation of rice genes unlike extant relevant databases , ricewiki features harnessing community intelligence in curation of rice genes , quantifying users contributions in each curated gene and providing explicit authorship for each contributor in any given gene , with the aim to attract more participation from the scientific community in collaborative and collective curation of rice genes . ricewiki has been implemented using mediawiki ( http://www.mediawiki.org ; a free and open source wiki engine ; version 1.18.4 ) , mysql ( http://www.mysql.org ; a free and popular relational database management system ; version 5.1.58 ) and php ( http://www.php.net ; a widely used general - purpose scripting language ; version 5.2.17 ) on a red hat enterprise linux server . the wide adoption of community intelligence in knowledge curation is primarily attributable to free wiki software such as mediawiki that provides a collaborative framework for knowledge collection , management and dissemination ( that powers wikipedia ) . mediawiki allows any user to add , modify or delete any content ( with customized permission control for editing ) via a web browser without any extra add - ons and thus enables web content to be edited easily , swiftly and collaboratively by multiple different users . history ; every change made to a page can be stored ; the user responsible for every change can be identified and every history revision can be reviewed or recovered . built on mediawiki , ricewiki enables users to be involved in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the contents . thus , ricewiki can significantly ease the process of knowledge collection , curation and sharing , befitting the exploding volume of biological data . in addition , mediawiki allows any user to develop customized functionalities by packaging a bunch of codes as mediawiki extensions . authorreward ( http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/extension:authorreward ) in ricewiki , with the aim to attract more participation from the scientific community for collaborative curation of rice genes . a wiki page can be collaboratively curated by multiple users and thus may have different edit versions . for each version that is contributed by a specific person , authorreward quantifies his / her contribution by factoring edit quality as well as edit quantity ; the edit quantity amounts to the edit distance in comparison with its previous version ( i.e. the minimum number of edit operations required to transform one string into the other ) , and the edit quality corresponds to whether the edit persists in comparison with the last version , ranging from 1 , when the edit is entirely reverted ( short - lived ) , to 1 , indicating that the edit is totally preserved in the last version ( long - lived ) . because one person may perform many discontinuous edits for a wiki page , his / her contribution score in this page is the sum of quantified contributions over all contributed edits . authorreward provides ricewiki with an authorship metric ; it quantifies users contributions and yields explicit authorship for each wiki page according to their quantitative contributions ( described later in the text ) . thus ,  authorreward bears the potential to increase community participation in ricewiki and to achieve community curation of massive biological knowledge . all extensions as well as software installed in ricewiki can be found at http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn/index.php/special:version . in ricewiki , users can access any content , but only registered users can perform the edits . this restriction is due to a trade - off between simplicity for users to make contributions and reliability of the edits provided . open identity provided by registration not only improves content reliability and increases users collaborations and communications , but it is also supportive to reward community - curated efforts by giving explicit authorship . thus , although the requirement of registration poses an unpleasant obstacle to community curation , it is of crucial significance for bio - wikis that would like to give credit to all contributors in reward for community - provided content . additionally , it is beneficial to greatly avoid vandalism or spammed content in bio - wikis , albeit , of course , there are multiple solutions for vandalism detection ( 43 ) . ricewiki incorporates the two common cultivated rice subspecies ( o. sativa indica 9311 and o. sativa japonica nipponbare ) and covers > 66 000 rice genes . as implemented on mediawiki , ricewiki inherits its features : each content page is associated with a discussion page ( where users can discuss content or leave a comment ) , a history page ( where revision as well as its contributor can be recognized ) and category terms ( that increase the usability for information management ) . the central objects of ricewiki are rice genes and thus each gene corresponds to a specific wiki page . to provide easy access to gene - specific pages , they are built based on gene identifiers . although they can also be based on gene names , it is noted that only a small part of rice genes has been well studied . with the ongoing studies on the biological functions of rice genes , a gene name often comes and goes as our knowledge about that entity increases , which would bring uncertainty of designations and synonyms of rice genes . thus , gene identifiers are relatively stable to refer to specific genes , as they do not change with the accumulation of novel information . the gene information in ricewiki was initially seeded from ncbi refseq ( 11 ) , ensembl ( 44 ) , rap - db ( 12 ) and msu rice genome annotation project ( http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu ) . the content of every gene in ricewiki is structured into multiple sections , namely ,  annotated information ,  structured information ,  labs working on this gene and  references , as well as a one - sentence summary for gene description at the top of each page ( figure 1 ) . annotated information is organized as free text and is helpful to users who share their knowledge and contribute edits without training in the curation or wiki techniques , significantly simplifying edits provision and lowering technological entrance barriers for wider community participation in curation . it can also fall into several sub - sections , such as  function , evolution and  expression , making it convenient to direct users to the sub - section(s ) of interest . although these sub - sections are preset , new sub - sections can be easily added and irrelevant sub - section(s ) can be deleted . such arrangement with multiple sub - sections enables not only automatic entry of information via application programming interface but also facilitates users to intuitively edit the information by clicking an edit link available to each sub - section . on the contrary ,  structured information is organized structurally in the form of a table , including gene symbol , gene description , sequence information , expression profile , external links to other related databases and a set of images from gbrowse ( 45 ) showing the genomic context of the gene and the gene structure . albeit the structure of this table is preset , it also allows users to provide updates and additions . labs working on this gene is a list of laboratories throughout the world working on this gene , facilitating communication and collaboration in curation of this gene . figure 1.screenshots of the ricewiki page for the rice semidwarf-1 ( sd1 ) gene , available at http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn/index.php/os01g0883800 . this gene was collaboratively curated by nine researchers , yielding 89 versions as of 1 august 2013 .

( e ) references , which are automatically generated and formatted with the help of the it is organized structurally in the form of a table , including gene symbol , gene description , sequence information , gene structure , etc . authorreward extension that quantifies researchers contributions and provides explicit authorship according to their quantitative contributions . the cutoff score for awarding authorship is configurable and set to 1 ( by default ) in ricewiki . screenshots of the ricewiki page for the rice semidwarf-1 ( sd1 ) gene , available at http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn/index.php/os01g0883800 . this gene was collaboratively curated by nine researchers , yielding 89 versions as of 1 august 2013 .

( e ) references , which are automatically generated and formatted with the help of the it is organized structurally in the form of a table , including gene symbol , gene description , sequence information , gene structure , etc . authorreward extension that quantifies researchers contributions and provides explicit authorship according to their quantitative contributions . the cutoff score for awarding authorship is configurable and set to 1 ( by default ) in ricewiki . the major focus of ricewiki is to exploit the full potential of the scientific community in collaborative curation of rice genes . it should be noted , however , that one crucial essential to making knowledge aggregation successful in ricewiki and also in other bio - wikis is sufficient participation ( 19 ) , which requires a large number of people from the scientific community to curate biological knowledge collectively and collaboratively . unfortunately , the current status is that , despite the presence of well - constructed bio - wikis , most researchers seldom make direct contributions . the reason is well known : most people in areas covered by bio - wikis are in academic research fields , and the currency of academic research careers is authorship , and bio - wikis do not offer attributable authorship . it is an especially severe issue for young researchers , who are most open to new technologies such as wikis , but for whom one s publication record is the significant determinant to his / her academic professional success ( 41 ) . it is inevitably time - consuming and poorly motivating for researchers to spend time performing curation without career - advancing credit ( 46 ) as opposed to writing their next paper although , arguably , contributing to a common and open resource such as a bio - wiki may have much broader scientific impacts . there is no mechanism to reward people who perform knowledge curation in bio - wikis . it has been recognized that the major limitation deterring researchers from active participation in bio - wikis is the lack of explicit authorship and thus no credit for their contributions ( 17,19,41 ) . it should be also noted , however , that not all people care about authorship , e.g. , long - term wikipedia editors . despite this , authorship might be essential to academic - based researchers . to attract more participation from the scientific community for ricewiki and to make it a vivid platform for community curation of rice genes authorreward ( 47 ) , an extension to mediawiki , which provides a standard practice to reward community - provided contents in bio - wikis by quantifying researchers contributions and providing explicit authorship according to their quantitative contributions . for each gene - centric page in ricewiki , community curation is quantified as a contribution score for each contributor in which both edit quantity and quality are taken into account ( figure 1 ) . accordingly , authorship in ricewiki is awarded only to a contributor whose contribution score is > 1 ( by default ; this cut - off score is configurable ) . at the top of each page , we provide the authorship information , displaying contributor name(s ) , gene i d , hyperlink to this gene and last update time , which is aimed to encourage community participation and to show clearly how to cite community - curated efforts . additionally , at the bottom of each page , we present the detailed information , including a pie chart to visualize quantified contributions of multiple contributors who were involved in curating this gene , a histogram to depict the edit quantity and quality for each contributor and a table summarizing contributor name , contribution score , edit count , edit quantity , edit quality , last edit time and edit details . as one person may perform curations for multiple different pages , we define the total contribution of this person to ricewiki as the sum of multiple contribution scores in all participated pages . with explicit authorship as a reward for community curation , ricewiki has the potential to attract more people to share their expertise and to provide edits on genes of their interest . wikiomics in action ( 48 ) . considering the ever - growing volume of rice data and related literature and contrastingly the relatively small number of expert curators working on rice , it should be noted that community curation is an important complement to expert curation , and community - based bio - wikis , like ricewiki , are not aimed for replacement of traditionally expert - driven databases . ricewiki harnesses community intelligence in curating a wide range of rice - related topics and thus can save considerable time and efforts of expert curators . to encourage collaborative curations of rice genes in ricewiki , expert curators can conduct quality control for community - contributed information and provide a variety of training ( e.g. , webinars , online tutorials and open discussion ) for the community on how to perform curation in an accurate and standard manner . meanwhile , journals can be also involved in curation by building a mechanism to regard community curation as a compulsory post - publication process and by providing obligations or incentives to authors submitting relevant information to ricewiki . such a mechanism has already been put into practice in the journal plant physiology , partnering with the arabidopsis information resource to increase the curation of arabidopsis . wider adoption of this practice would be enormously beneficial to curatorial efficiency , accuracy and reliability ( as testified by the admirable annotations for arabidopsis ) . therefore , the community as well as expert curators , authors , and journals should collaborate together to make ricewiki more influential and to achieve community curation of massive rice knowledge . future directions for ricewiki include establishment of close collaborations with laboratories in the world working on rice . rice knowledge and related data developed by many laboratories and researchers should be added to ricewiki and shared with the whole scientific community . we will also promote , as best as we can partnership with journals to require community curation as a compulsory post - publication . in addition , we encourage investigators / teachers to incorporate community curation of rice genes in ricewiki as student assignments . for example , n students collaborate to curate n rice genes , where n  3 , and contribution score for each student should be > 1 . ricewiki will continue to integrate more types of data ( e.g. , mutants , repetitive elements , expression and phenotyping ) from different resources and improve the connections with existing relevant databases . we have collected 40 000 rice - related publications from pubmed ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ ) , including title , author(s ) , affiliation(s ) , abstract and hyperlinks to the full text ( if available ) , and currently are attempting to dig out the . therefore , ricewiki will also integrate tools particularly for literature mining ( 49,50 ) and incorporate literature - based curated annotation , to realize automatic information retrieval and improve the credibility of community - provided contents . in response to an update of literature collection , ricewiki will build a mechanism to send an invitation to authors with recent publications for curation of specific genes ( 51 ) . in sum it exploits the whole power of the scientific community in collaborative curation of rice genes by rewarding community - provided content through contribution quantification and explicit authorship . such a collaborative community - contributed and contribution - rewarded resource would make it possible to build a rice encyclopedia by and for the scientific community ( 52 ) that harnesses collective intelligence for collaborative knowledge curation , covers all aspects of biological knowledge and keeps evolving with novel knowledge . 100-talent program of chinese academy of sciences [ y1slxb1365 to z.z . ] ; the national basic research and development program [ 973 program ; 2010cb126604 to j.x . ] ; national programs for high technology research and development [ 863 program ; 2012aa020409 to z.z . and j.x . ] , the ministry of science and technology of the people s republic of china . funding for open access charge : national programs for high technology research and development [ 863 program ; 2012aa020409 ] , the ministry of science and technology of the people s republic of china .","rice is the most important staple food for a large part of the world s human population and also a key model organism for biological studies of crops as well as other related plants .

"frontotemporal dementia ( ftd ) is the second most common type of presenile dementia , and a clinically , genetically and pathologically heterogeneous disorder [ 1 , 2 ] . four clinical subtypes can be distinguished : the behavioural variant of ftd ( bvftd ) , semantic dementia ( sd ) , progressive non - fluent aphasia ( pnfa ) , and ftd with motor neuron disease ( ftd - mnd ) . frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( ftld ) is the common underlying pathology of all four clinical variants , and can be divided into ftld with tau - positive immunoreactive inclusions ( ftld - tau ) and ftld with ubiquitin - positive immunoreactive inclusions ( ftld - u ) . after the tdp-43 protein was found to be the major constituent of ubiquitin - positive inclusions , the latter term was changed to ftld - tdp . however , the identification of tdp-43-negative inclusions in some ftld - u cases has resulted in the designation of a new neuropathological subtype , atypical ftld - u [ 46 ] . very recently , the name of this subtype has been changed into ftld - fused in sarcoma ( ftld - fus ) by the observation of positive staining of these inclusions with antibody against fus protein . the characteristic features of ftld - fus are an early - onset ftd with severe progressive psychobehavioural changes , a negative family history and striking atrophy of the striatum at neuropathological examination [ 47 ] . its exact frequency is yet unknown , and neuroimaging features may differentiate it from other subtypes during life . the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of ftld - fus in our ftld - u cases and to describe the clinical , neuroimaging and neuropathological features of ftld - fus . furthermore , we estimated the prevalence of ftld - fus in our clinical cohort of ftd on the basis of a combination of specific clinical features . patients with ftd were ascertained in an ongoing genetic - epidemiologic study conducted in the netherlands since 1994 [ 1 , 8 , 9 ] , after referral to the out - clinic department of the erasmus medical center , or after a visit in nursing homes and psychogeriatric hospitals by the research physician . detailed clinical history was obtained from the spouses and first - degree relatives using a checklist of behavioural and cognitive changes , and motor neuron signs . the age at onset was defined as the age at which the first symptom compatible with ftd diagnosis was observed by a close relative or caretaker [ 1 , 9 ] . during the neurological examination carried out in all patients , special attention was paid to the presence of extrapyramidal and motor neuron disease signs . data on family history were provided by a spouse or first - degree relative using a structured questionnaire . family history was defined as positive if patients had at least one - first - degree relative with dementia , parkinsonism , or mnd , irrespective of their age of onset . neuropsychological evaluation consisted of tests for memory functions ( rey figure , 15-word test ) , attention and concentration , executive functions ( stroop , trailmaking a and b , wisconsin card sorting test , wais subtest substitution ) , language ( boston naming test , the dutch revised version of the semantic association test ) , and visuoconstructive and visuospatial skills ( clock drawing , block design of the wais ) , and was performed in a subset of patients at our out - clinic department . due to the variation in test batteries , a detailed comparison between subgroups was not possible . mri scans performed between 1990 and 2008 were available for evaluation in 136 out of 387 patients . available t1-weighted mr , t2-weighted mr , proton - density ( pd ) weighted mr , and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( flair ) mr images were used for evaluation . the severity of cortical and caudate atrophy on mri was evaluated and semi - quantitatively rated according to a three - point scale : ( 0 ) normal caudate nucleus ; ( 1 ) mild or moderate atrophy of the caudate nucleus , either still bulging into the lateral ventricle or with a flat contour ; ( 2 ) severe atrophy with no visible caudate nucleus . the presence of caudate atrophy was evaluated by a radiologist and neurologist blinded to clinical and pathological findings . mutation screening of all exons and exon  intron regions of mapt , grn and chmp2b genes was performed in all patients with a positive family history , and in a subset of patients with sporadic ftd ( n  =  72 ) as previously described [ 1 , 9 ] . two hundred thirty - two patients died during a follow up period of 14  years , of which 74 patients underwent brain autopsy . brain autopsy was carried out within four hours of death according to the legal and ethical code of conduct of the netherlands brain bank . macroscopic inspection of the brain included the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes , cerebellum , hippocampus , basal ganglia and substantia nigra . tissue blocks were taken from all cortical areas , hippocampus , amygdala , basal ganglia , substantia nigra , pons , medulla oblongata , cerebellum , and cervical spinal cord . they were embedded in paraffin blocks and subjected to routine staining with haematoxylin - eosin , bodian , methenamine - silver , and congo red . the severity of neuron loss was scored as absent , mild , or moderate - severe . immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies directed against : hyperphosphorylated tau ( at-8 , innogenetics , ghent , belgium ; 1:400 ) ; ubiquitin ( anti - ubiquitin , dako , glostrup , denmark ; 1:500 , following 80c antigen retrieval ) ; -amyloid protein ( anti - beta amyloid , dako , glostrup , denmark ; 1:100 , following formic acid pre - treatment ) ; -synuclein ( anti--synuclein ; zymed laboratories , san francisco , california , usa ; undiluted , following formic acid pre - treatment ) ; poli - ubiquitin - binding protein p62 ( bd biosciences pharmingen , san diego , ca , usa ; 1:200 , following pressure cooking ) ; tdp-43 ( biotech , chicago , il , usa ; 1:100 , following pressure cooking ) ; and internexin ( anti - alpha - internexin , invitrogen , camarillo , ca , usa , 1:100 , following pressure - cooking ) , fus ( sigma - aldrich anti - fus ; 1:251:200 with initial overnight incubation at room temperature , following pressure cooking ) . antigen retrieval was done either for 30  min in 0.1  m sodium citrate buffer at 80c and ph 7.7 or using pressure cooking in 0.1  m sodium citrate buffer ( ph 6 ) for 5  min . pre - treatment with 70% formic acid was done for 5  min ( -synuclein and -amyloid ) . endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubation for 30  min in pbs - hydrogen peroxide - sodiumazide solution ( 100  ml 0,1  m pbs  +  2  ml 30% h2o2  +  1  ml natriumazide ) . the histostain - plus broad - spectrum kit dab ( zymed , san francisco , california , usa ) was used and slides were counterstained with mayer s haematoxylin and mounted in entellan . neuropathological examination of brains from the 74 autopsied patients with clinical ftd revealed 70 brains with ftld ( ftld - u in 37 , ftld - tau in 32 and ftld with no inclusions ( ftld - ni ) in one ) , whereas familial creutzfeldt - jakob disease ( fcjd ) was diagnosed in two brains , and alzheimer s disease ( ad ) in the remaining two . the study was approved by the medical ethical committee at the erasmus mc - university medical center rotterdam . for each patient , a spouse or first - degree relative of the patient gave written informed consent . thirty - three out of 37 ftld - u cases ( 0.89 ; 95% ci : 0.791.00 ) showed positive staining with the tdp-43 antibody and were reclassified as ftld - tdp , whereas four cases had ubiquitin - positive , tdp-43-negative inclusions . all four ftld - u patients with tdp-43 negative inclusions showed positive staining with the fus antibody and were designated as ftld - fus . ftld - fus was present in 4 out of all 70 ftld brains ( 0.06 ; 95% ci : 0.000.11 ) , and in four out of 37 ftld - u cases ( 0.11 ; 95% ci : 0.000.21 ) . demographic and clinical data of the four patients with ftld - fus are presented in table  1 . all four patients had clinical bvftd and a negative family history , and three out of four patients had an age at onset before the age of 40 . the presenting symptoms varied among these four cases . two patients presented with obsessive  compulsive behaviour , in particular showing extremely parsimonious behaviour . case 1 and case 3 showed sexually disinhibited behaviour ( case 1 frequently visited prostitutes , while married ) . three out of four patients shoplifted several shops , especially the two patients who presented with obsessive  compulsive behaviour . hyperorality has developed in all four patients , and was the presenting symptom in three patients . visual hallucinations of deformed paintings were mentioned in the case of one patient , and persecution delusions in another . all patients developed language problems later in the course of the disease , with economy of utterances in all , perseverations ( n  =  3 ) , echolalia ( n  =  2 ) , stereotypy ( n  =  2 ) and eventually mutism in all . neurological examination was unremarkable without signs of motor neuron disease , pyramidal or extrapyramidal dysfunction , except for mild left -

fus of three percent in the total series of patients with clinical ftd , based on the clinical variables age at onset , family history , and clinical subtype . all four ftld - fus cases presented with severe behavioural changes , young age at onset , negative family history , and caudate atrophy on mri . ftld - fus cases were pathologically characterized by striking atrophy of the caudate nucleus , ubiquitin and fus - positive , p62 and tdp-43-negative nii with remarkable morphology . the present observation of three percent of ftld - fus in a large clinical cohort of ftd patients gives a frequency estimation of this subtype for the first time . of the four ftld - fus patients , three had an age at onset 40  years , negative family history , and clinical presentation of bvftd . as 11 patients within the age group 40  years of our cohort meet the combination of these features , this suggests an even higher frequency in this age group . our observed age distribution is in line with that of the other reported series of ftld with tdp-43 negative inclusions ( 28 to 63  years ) [ 46 ] . delusions and hallucinations in the present cases may be discriminative features of this type of ftld , as their occurrence is uncommon for the total ftd group . the initial diagnosis of a primary psychiatric disorder has been considered in one of the present patients , as well as in several other recently reported cases [ 4 , 5 ] . the occurrence of disinhibition and obsessive compulsive behaviour was reported in the present cases , while aggressive behaviour was reported in others . although we did not have pathological verification of four other patients , the combination of age at onset 40  years , negative family history , presence of severe behavioural changes and caudate atrophy is highly suggestive of ftld - fus . our suggested prevalence of three percent could be an underestimate , as ~30 percent of all cases described so far had an age at onset above 40  years , and not all patients in our cohort had an available mri to semi - quantitatively score the caudate atrophy [ 46 ] . the observation of caudate atrophy on mri in our ftld - fus cases during life has not been reported so far , but is in line with the presence of caudate atrophy and severe neuron loss at neuropathological examination . neuroimaging features during life were not explicitly mentioned in three pathological studies on tdp-43-negative ftld - u cases ( ftld - fus in the new nomenclature ) [ 1517 ] . although smaller caudate volumes may be seen in the end - stage of ftd [ 18 , 19 ] , severe caudate atrophy was already detectable in the early disease stage of the present ftld - fus cases . prominent caudate atrophy is characteristic for huntington s disease , but chorea or other extrapyramidal signs were absent in the present cases . the occurrence of ftld - fus in 11% of our ftld - u cases lies between the frequencies reported in other series [ 46 ] , and emphasizes the idea that alternative pathophysiological mechanisms exist in the clinicopathological spectrum of ftld and motor neuron disease . the fus protein containing 526 amino - acids has structural similarities with tdp-43 and is involved in dna repair and the regulation of transcription , rna splicing , and export to cytoplasm [ 7 , 20 , 21 ] . mutations in the fus gene located on chromosome 16 have recently been identified in familial als with ubiquitin and fus - positive , tdp-43-negative inclusions [ 20 , 21 ] . the tdp-43-negative , fus - positive cytoplasmatic inclusions have also been found in neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease ( nifid ) cases , whereas their presence has yet to be investigated in other related disorders : ftld caused by chmp2b mutations , basophilic inclusion body disease ( bibd ) , and als due to sod1 mutations [ 2326 ] . the remarkable vermiform or c - shaped morphology of the nii reported in all cases seems to be pathognomic for ftld - fus and differs from the lentiform or cat - eye shaped nii in grn mutations [ 46 , 2729 ] . moreover , nii of grn mutations shows a different immunohistochemical pattern with tdp-43 positive and fus negative staining . the relevance of exclusive p62-positive staining of the cytoplasmatic inclusions ( and not of nii ) still has to be determined . the question is whether the p62 protein is merely entrapped in these inclusions or plays a pathophysiological role in these disorders . the recent finding of accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and neurodegeneration in mice with genetic inactivation of the p62 gene supports the latter hypothesis . a major drawback of the present study is the absence of a quantitative assessment of caudate atrophy on mri . future prospective follow - up studies with voxel - based morphometry of the caudate nucleus on mri are needed to determine the progression of caudate atrophy over time in ftld - fus . in conclusion , ftld - fus age at onset 40  years , negative family history , bvftd and caudate atrophy on mri could be useful clinical predictors of ftld - fus as an underlying pathology in patients with clinical ftd . larger samples of ftld - fus cases are needed to verify and to add new predictors for this clinicopathological subtype .","frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( ftld ) is a clinically , genetically and pathologically heterogeneous disorder . within ftld with ubiquitin - positive inclusions ( ftld - u ) , a new pathological subtype named ftld - fus was recently found with fused in sarcoma ( fus ) positive , tdp-43-negative inclusions , and striking atrophy of the caudate nucleus . 
 the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of ftld - fus in our pathological ftld series , and to describe the clinical , neuroimaging and neuropathological features of ftld - fus , especially caudate atrophy . 
 demographic and clinical data collected prospectively from 387 patients with frontotemporal dementia ( ftd ) yielded 74 brain specimens . immunostaining was carried out using a panel of antibodies , including at-8 , ubiquitin , p62 , fus , and tdp-43 . 
 cortical and caudate atrophy on mri ( n  =  136 ) was rated as normal , mild - moderate or severe . of the 37 ftld - u cases , 
 33 were reclassified as ftld - tdp and four ( 0.11 , 95% : 0.000.21 ) as ftld - fus , with ubiquitin and fus - positive , p62 and tdp-43-negative neuronal intranuclear inclusions ( nii ) . 
 all four ftld - fus cases had a negative family history , behavioural variant ftd ( bvftd ) , and three had an age at onset 40  years . 
 mri revealed mild - moderate or severe caudate atrophy in all , with a mean duration from onset till mri of 63  months ( range 16119  months ) . in our total clinical ftd cohort 
 , we found 11 patients ( 0.03 ; 95% ci : 0.010.05 ) with bvftd , negative family history , and age at onset 40  years . 
 caudate atrophy was present in 10 out of 136 mris , and included all four fus - cases . 
 the newly identified ftld - fus has a frequency of 11% in ftld - u , and an estimated frequency of three percent in our clinical ftd cohort . 
 the existence of this pathological subtype can be predicted with reasonable certainty by age at onset 40  years , negative family history , bvftd and caudate atrophy on mri .",516
"physical activity refers to any movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure , and can be measured quantitatively using metabolic equivalents or step - counts ( 9 ) . as such , physical activity is an encompassing term that includes exercise , training , participating in sport , active play and active transportation . secular trends for increasing levels of sedentary behavior and low levels of physical activity result in only 7% of children aged 5 to 17 years engaging in the recommended 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity ( mvpa ) a day ( 1 ) . this recent report identifying children s low level of physical activity also noted , that : north americans value efficiency - doing more in less time - which may be at odds with promoting children s physical activity and health ( 1 ) . to promote an environment that allows children to reach the minimum physical activity recommendations , it is paramount for influencing factors to be identified . reduced use of active transportation , decreased levels of spontaneous active play ( especially outdoor play ) , and decreased school physical activity and physical education , has resulted in low levels of physical activity and high levels of sedentary time in children and youth ( specifically , ages 517 years ) ( 3 ) . one of the most prominent influences on children s physical activity levels may be their parents / guardians ( referred to as parents , hereafter ) . parents serve as role models for their children , logistical supporters ( financially and otherwise ) , encouragers , and as co - participators ( 2 ) . parents also act as guardians and can either promote or restrict children s activity . as the literature suggests , more controlling and restrictive parents relate to children with lower physical activity levels ( 7 ) . the varying domains of parental influence may have lasting effects on their children s physical activity with numerous studies reflecting the importance of parental involvement and encouragement specifically ( 2 ) . the intent of this study was to examine the relationship between physical activity levels in parents and their children as well as the various influences parents have on their children s physical activity . if highly related , encouraging not only children s physical activity but also their parents physical activity and how , when , and in what manner parents encourage their children to be physically active could have an emerging influence on increasing physical activity levels in children . using convenience sampling , parents and their children aged 7 to 10 years old from a local afterschool physical activity program were invited to participate in this study . in total fifteen child - parent pairs parents were asked to complete a 17-item self - report questionnaire regarding their child s participation in physical activity and the various ways they might influence it . this questionnaire was developed specifically for this study with questions about ( 1 ) parent s support / encouragement , ( 2 ) restrictiveness ( willingness to allow children to play actively outside ) and ( 3 ) personal participation in physical activity . i arrange to get my child to and from his / her sporting events and/or after school programs  . an example of a question regarding restrictiveness is :  i feel it is safe for my child to play outside  . for these two types of questions , a 5-point likert scale was used with responses ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree . parental participation was determined from questions like :  how often , in a typical week , do you participate in physical activity or exercise ?  . response options included  never / rarely , 12 times , 34 times , 56 times , and daily  . responses to each section of the questionnaire were scored 1 to 5 with higher values given to positive affirmation of children s physical activity ( such as higher levels of support , and/or higher levels of physical activity participation ) . upon receipt of the completed questionnaire , the child and parent were asked to wear pedometers ( piezo step rx , stepcount ) for all waking hours for seven days , excluding all water - based activities ( i.e. , bathing , swimming , etc . ) . parents were also asked to record any non - wear time for themselves and for their child as well as the time the pedometer was put on in the morning and taken off at night . for each child and parent in the study , their moderate - vigorous intensity activity and total number of steps were recorded and averaged over the number of days collected ( 3 to 7 days ) to provide an overall summary or indication of their level of physical activity . although each child - parent pair were asked to wear their pedometer for seven days , participants data were still included in the analyses provided there were at least three complete ( 10 + hours ) days of pedometer data . to determine the relationship between parent and child physical activity levels , a one - tailed pearson product correlation analyses was conducted between the parent and child s average steps per day with an -level of p  0.05 to determine significance . to address the secondary purposes of this study , data obtained via the questionnaires the parents likert - scale responses to the questionnaire were totalled for each section of the questionnaire with total scores ranging from a possible 5 to 20 points for support / encouragement and 5 to 15 for restrictiveness and self - reported participation . pearson product correlations were then used to determine the correlation coefficients between these variables and the children s average steps per day with significance set at p  0.05 . using convenience sampling , parents and their children aged 7 to 10 years old from a local afterschool physical activity program were invited to participate in this study . in total fifteen child - parent pairs parents were asked to complete a 17-item self - report questionnaire regarding their child s participation in physical activity and the various ways they might influence it . this questionnaire was developed specifically for this study with questions about ( 1 ) parent s support / encouragement , ( 2 ) restrictiveness ( willingness to allow children to play actively outside ) and ( 3 ) personal participation in physical activity . i arrange to get my child to and from his / her sporting events and/or after school programs  . an example of a question regarding restrictiveness is :  i feel it is safe for my child to play outside  . for these two types of questions , a 5-point likert scale was used with responses ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree . parental participation was determined from questions like :  how often , in a typical week , do you participate in physical activity or exercise ?  . never / rarely , 12 times , 34 times , 56 times , and daily  . responses to each section of the questionnaire were scored 1 to 5 with higher values given to positive affirmation of children s physical activity ( such as higher levels of support , and/or higher levels of physical activity participation ) . upon receipt of the completed questionnaire , the child and parent were asked to wear pedometers ( piezo step rx , stepcount ) for all waking hours for seven days , excluding all water -

tailed pearson product correlation analyses was conducted between the parent and child s average steps per day with an -level of p  0.05 to determine significance . to address the secondary purposes of this study , data obtained via the questionnaires were examined in greater detail . the parents likert - scale responses to the questionnaire were totalled for each section of the questionnaire with total scores ranging from a possible 5 to 20 points for support / encouragement and 5 to 15 for restrictiveness and self - reported participation . pearson product correlations were then used to determine the correlation coefficients between these variables and the children s average steps per day with significance set at p  0.05 . although 17 parent - child pairs consented to participate in this study , only the data from 15 parent - child pairs were included in the data analyses because one child lost the pedometer and another set was not returned . as previously mentioned for inclusion in the study , parents needed to complete the questionnaire and parents and children had to provide at least three days of sufficient pedometer data ( minimally 10 hours ) . in fulfilling these requirements , 30 participants or 15 parent - child pairs were included in the data analyses . on average , parents took 8438.13  2758.67 steps per day while their children took 13077.00  3026.93 steps . there was no significant correlation between the average number of steps for parents and their children ( r = 0.069 ; p = 0.597 ) as shown in figure 1 . a pearson product correlation analyses between children s number of steps per day and the various measures of parental influence ( see table 2 ) were then conducted . it was found that there were no relationships between ( a ) children s steps and parent s self - reported support / encouragement ( r = 0.045 , p = 0.564 ) , ( b ) , children s steps and parent s self - reported restrictiveness ( r = .0254 , p = 0.820 ) , or ( c ) children s steps and parent s self - reported participation / co - participation in physical activity ( r = 0.002 , p = 0.503 ) . the purpose of this study was primarily to determine the relationship between parents and their children s physical activity . a secondary purpose was to determine the relationship of other parental factors ( encouragement / support , restrictiveness and self - reported participation / co - participation ) with children s physical activity levels . the lack of significant relationship between children and their parents physical activity might suggest that the basis of children s activity does not lie primarily in parental factors and their role modeling . other influences such as intrinsic motivations to be physically active might play more prominent roles then once perceived . although on average , the children ( ~ 13,000 steps / day ) exceeded the minimum recommendations of 12,000 steps per day , their parents ( ~ 8,400 steps / day ) did not meet the recommended 10,000 steps per day ( 3 ) . a possible explanation for this data might be that in some instances , such as sporting practices or tournaments , parents drive their child to participate but when their child is partaking in the physical activity , parents are in most instances , spectators . for most of the day , some parents engage in high amounts of sedentary time ( as required by their jobs ) . these low levels of physical activity are confirmed with only 15% of canadians adults meeting the minimum physical activity requirements of 150 minutes of mvpa per week ( 1 ) . children on the other hand have recess , and in some instances afterschool programs that allow for higher levels of physical activity . the parent s lower levels of physical activity while their children are active may help to explain the lack of support for the hypothesis that parents and children s physical activity levels would be related . perhaps there might be a more complex interconnection between parental modeling of physical activity and children s level of physical activity than expected . with lower levels of physical activity , rates of chronic and acute health concerns increase , making it paramount for attention to be given to identify possible factors connected to children s physical activity . it is important to note the lack of variance in children s steps ( as most were between 10,000 and 15,000 steps per day ) while the adult steps showed considerable variability ranging from about 4,000 to 15,000 steps per day . in other words , this suggests these children were equally physically active despite differences that may exist among them such as sport participation and/or parental factors . there was a much larger fluctuation in the parents step counts and therefore also in their level of physical activity . a closer look at the individual data shows that only three parents , or 19% of the sample obtained more than 10,000 steps per day while nine children ( or 56% ) had over 12,000 steps per day . further , in this study , every child obtained the recommended minimum amount of 60 minutes of moderate or more intense physical activity per day ( as determined by the time of pedometer steps greater than 100 per minute ) . the parents were also on pace for acquiring the minimum recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate or more intense physical activity per week ( assuming their steps were obtained in bouts of at least ten ) . this paradox of the parents attaining the physical activity recommendations according to minutes of mvpa but not reaching the recommended number of steps / per day could possibly be explained by parents who are extremely active for two or more hours one day , and are less active through the rest of the week ( or something similar ) . it should be noted that the sample of children in the study was more physically active than the general population . with 56% of children in the study obtaining more than the recommended steps per day , it is difficult to draw reasonable conclusions reflective of the general populace where only 7% of 5 to 17 year olds achieve the minimum physical activity requirements . as such , within a normal population , parental factors may play a more prominent role in the development and/or adherence to their children s physical activity . the lack of relationship between parents self - reported support / encouragement of their children s physical activity was surprising , given previous research ( 2 , 10 ) . the results indicate that although parents self - reported considerable supportive and encouraging behaviours , it did not relate to their children s physical activity . parental support , particularly positive encouragement and interpersonal actions it has also been suggested that physical activity interventions should focus on improving parental encouragement specifically increasing positive tangible support , such as helping and teaching certain techniques ; however , the results of the present study do not support this suggestion ( 11 , 12 ) . contrarily , the results of our study suggest parental support and encouragement may not play as a significant role as once thought . many parents in our study self - reported high levels of financial support as they noted their children attending sporting programs and afterschool programs ; however , the correlation between this influence and children s level of physical activity was non - significant . a prevailing theme to understand this complexity is to note that the sample selected in this study was more active than the population , and that despite the overwhelming parental support / encouragement , it did not relate to their children s level of physical activity . another hypothesis not supported in this study was that less parental control or restrictiveness would relate to higher physical activity rates in children . this finding is also surprising because up until this point , advocates for physical activity promotion in children , particularly those for outdoor play , have said that allowing children to be more creative and explorative is paramount to permitting them to be more physically active ( 6 , 7 ) . it is possible ; however , that with the influences of technology and social media that less restrictive parents are giving their children more freedom , just to have their children  hang - out  with friends , playing gaming systems or watching television . realistically , parents do not always know what their children are doing with friends when away from their supervision , and this could be one theory that could explain the lack of a correlation . equally surprising was the lack of significant relationship between the parents self - reported participation and children s level of physical activity primarily because children often do what they see . by this notion , a higher level of parental participation in physical activity should then relate to higher levels of physical activity in children . it has been speculated that higher levels of parental co - play could relate to higher levels of children s physical activity because children might enjoy playing with their parents ( 8) . however , some children report that parents are too rule - driven when they play together , and that parental games are not as fun as children s games ( 5 ) . this lack of enjoyment of being physically active together could contribute to the lack of correlation between parents and children s physical activity levels . the sample size for this study was relatively small , with only 15 child - parent pairs providing complete data and may be a limitation , particularly as the participants were localized in a smaller demographic and came from the same afterschool physical activity program . as such the findings are limited to children 7 to 10 years of age and their parents . it is also important to identify cultural aspects of the study , which could also pose limitations ; as participant experiences may have been affected by a north american culture . self - report questionnaires are inherently limited by their nature of self - report and the potential for bias to present oneself as a good parent who does all they could / should for their children . more female ( 11 ) than male ( 4 ) parents provided data for this study , and parental age was not taken into consideration , both potential limitations . further research could ensure a balanced representation of parent participants as well as data collection from a larger age range of children and family situations ( single parent , lower income , younger / older parents , different bmis , etc . ) . future studies should consider children s motivations for being physically active as well as identifying possible influences of how different parenting styles ( e.g. , supportive , authoritative ) might affect physical activity in children . further , it may be worth exploring the children s perceptions of how their parents involvement may affect their overall activity levels . what is not clear is the impact of parental influences , particularly interrelated in relation to peer influences and how much of a role they play in children s adherence and physical activity participation . it may be that parents think they are positive role models for their children s physical activity and that they think they are supportive and encouraging when in fact they may not be , or may not have as great an influence as they think as found in this study . given that only 7% of children aged 5 to 17 years are meeting the minimal physical activity guidelines ( 3 ) , there is a high importance to identify possible factors that influence physical activity for current and long term health , something must be done . in conclusion , the lack of significant relationships found between parents and their children s physical activity in the data suggests that there is more to children s physical activity levels than parental support / encouragement , restrictiveness and participation . clarity and an objective evaluation of this relationship may lead to a better understanding , which may lead to more effective physical activity promotion in children . maybe it is time that we begin to change the way we think about physical activity , as the theories engrained in our minds are not the same as the realities being produced .","engaging in a physically active lifestyle relates positively to current health and reduces chances of chronic diseases in the future . 
 given escalating health care costs , it is paramount to reduce illnesses associated with a lack of physical activity and thus critical to identify factors that influence physical activity - especially in children , with the opportunity for a lifetime impact . 
 one of these influencing factors may be parents / guardians . 
 the intent of this study was to examine the relationship between children s physical activity levels and parental factors including parental physical activity , support / encouragement , restrictiveness , and self - reported participation . 
 data was collected from 15 child - parent pairs with children ranging in age from 7 to 10 years . 
 daily physical activity levels were determined from pedometer data using a piezo sc - step pedometer . 
 number of steps and moderate and vigorous physical activity were extracted from the pedometers and levels of support / encouragement , restrictiveness , and participation were quantified from parents self - reported responses to a questionnaire created for this study . 
 pearson product correlation analyses were carried out between : the children s and parent steps ( r = 0.069 ; p = 0.597 ) ; children s steps and parent s self - reported encouragement / support ( r = 0.045 , p = 0.563 ) ; children s steps and parents self - reported restrictiveness ( r = .0254 , p = 0.820 ) ; and children s steps and parents self - reported participation ( r = 0.002 , p = 0.503 ) . 
 the lack of significant relationships among these variables implies that more complex interactions occur between children and their parents regarding physical activity with children s participation influenced by other factors .",348
"the loss of teeth , very common in this population , is related to the reduction of bone tissue , receptors ( proprioceptors and periodontal ligaments ) , and muscle atrophy . consequently , orofacial functions are impaired in toothless individuals.1 in addition , prostheses are functionally less efficient when compared to individuals with natural dentition.1,2 the stability of the jaw occlusion of the posterior teeth or prostheses is important for the swallowing function.2 the dental condition and the use of poorly fitting prostheses may contribute to the difficulties arising from old age , and the oral diet and nutritional status of the elderly may be affected by changes related to aging3 and changes in skill and desire to feel , bite , chew4 and swallow food,3,5 significantly compromising and further aggravating the quality of life of these individuals.6 the literature has shown the influence of oral health condition on swallowing and nutrition , indirectly influencing the daily life activities of the elderly.7 furthermore , it is clear that maintenance of oral health is essential for the general health , quality of life , chewing ability8 and , mainly , the reduction of pneumonia risk in fragile elderly people,8,9 for it is already known that bacterial colonies in oropharyngeal tissues and in dental plaque are the greatest precursors for the development of aspiration respiratory infections.10 besides the influence of the loss of dentition , the functional impairments resulting from aging may be potentiated by neurological changes resulting in dysphagia in patients , an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this population.11 in the adult and elderly population , dysphagia is most commonly associated with stroke.12 more than half of patients who have suffered stroke present between six and ten types of disability , muscle weakness being the most prevalent one , followed by communication , speech , and swallowing disorders.13 specifically regarding swallowing , the stroke entails increased oropharyngeal transit time,14,15 changes in motor control of tongue,16 as well as the presence of laryngotracheal aspiration of food.16,17 once the physiological changes resulting from aging in swallowing may be aggravated by loss of teeth and the use of poorly fitting prostheses , the severity of dysphagia could be influenced by the oral health condition and use of dental prostheses in elderly patients with neurological diseases . however , according to the literature studied , no research has made the correlation between the findings of the swallowing performance with oral health in elderly patients after stroke . therefore , the aim of this study was to relate the condition of oral health to the level of oral intake and the degree of swallowing dysfunction in elderly patients with stroke in chronic phase . thirty poststroke individuals , aged 61 to 90 years , whose injury happened 6 months to 9 years previously to their participation in this prospective study . the inclusion criteria considered the following cases : affected by stroke as attested by a medical report , through clinical diagnosis and imaging , with a minimum time of 6 months ; aged over 60 years , being in regular clinical neurological monitoring , not having undergone dysphagia rehabilitation ; presenting general stable health that would enable the realization of the proposed tests . in order to achieve a greater delineation of the group , in addition to considering the group of 30 individuals ( heterogeneous group [ hg ] ) , the total dentate , the total edentulous without dental prostheses , and individuals with more than one episode of stroke were excluded and the participants were divided into two groups , according to the

who  oral health surveys : basic methods,18 including the assessment of dental status by the number of decayed , missing , and filled teeth ( dmft ) and evaluation of dental prostheses . the prostheses were evaluated for retention , functional stability , smile aesthetics , degree of bone resorption , and quality of the mucosa.19 from the evaluation , the dental arches were classified as without prosthesis or with the presence of partial or complete dental prosthesis ; later , the use or need for replacement of dental prostheses was indicated . the need for prostheses replacement was as follows : 0 , no need to change ; 1 , partial dental prosthesis was necessary in one of the dental arches ; 2 , need for partial dental prosthesis in both dental arches ; 3 , need for complete dental prosthesis in one of the dental arches ; 4 , need for dental prosthesis in both dental arches . research of oral ingestion was performed by reviewing the usual food consumption patterns referred to in the 24-hour dietary recall . from the data obtained by the research of oral ingestion , patients were classified according to the levels of the functional oral intake scale ( fois),20 on a scale from i to vii , considering the diet characteristics based on the properties and texture of the food.21 the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing ( fees ) was performed by an otorhinolaryngologist physician collaboratively with the speech therapist . subjects were asked to remain seated with their heads arranged in the direction of the body axis , without bending or

corporation , tokyo , japan ) . three consistent standardized foods were evaluated : liquid ( 10 ml of filtered water ) , thick pudding ( 10 ml of thickened dietary grape juice , reaching a final consistency similar to that of pudding ) , and solid ( half a slice of bread , 1 cm thick ) . from the data obtained by the fees , the severity rating of the swallowing disorder was determined in accordance with the scale of functional impairment of swallowing of macedo filho,22,23 which subdivides the dysphagia severity levels ( normal , mild , moderate , and severe ) . spearman s test was used to verify the correlation between the oral health condition ( dmft , number of teeth present , and the need for prostheses replacement ) and the performance in the swallowing function ( classification in the fois scale and dysphagia rating in each consistency ) . for this analysis to be performed , the fois scale and the degree of dysphagia were numerically classified from 1 to 7 and from 1 to 4 , respectively . for comparison of fois results and dysphagia classification , among the different types of prostheses used in the upper and lower dental arches ( complete dental

fois scale and the degree of dysphagia were numerically classified from 1 to 7 and from 1 to 4 , respectively . for comparison of fois results and dysphagia classification , among the different types of prostheses used in the upper and lower dental arches ( complete dental prosthesis , partial dental prosthesis , denture or none ) , the kruskal according to the evaluation of oral condition , the mean of dmft of elderly individuals affected by stroke in this study was 28.7 , while the mean of remaining teeth was 5.6 , showing that most individuals were edentulous . table 2 shows the types of prostheses used by the elderly individuals affected by stroke in each dental arch and the need for prostheses replacement . according to the results of the functional oral intake scale , most individuals ( 53% ) presented as level v on the fois , followed by level iv ( 34% ) and level vii ( 13% ) . with the severity rating of the swallowing disorder , no occurrence of severe the distribution of the elderly affected by stroke according to severity rating of the swallowing disorder is shown in table 3 , as well . according to the results of the statistical analysis , correlations between the oral health condition and the results of the fois scale in elderly individuals affected by stroke in this study were found . there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the need for replacement of prostheses and the rating scale , and also in the hg and in rhg , showing that the greater the need for replacement of the prosthesis , the worse the rating of the fois scale . there were differences in the classification of the fois scale , for the lhg , in the different types of prostheses used in the upper dental arch , whereas for the rhg the difference in the classification of fois occurred between groups of individuals with different types of prostheses used in the lower dental arch . after completion of the dunn s post - test , the difference was confirmed only in the lhg , demonstrating that individuals of this group with partial prostheses in the upper arch ( ie , that still had natural elements and whose missed teeth had been rehabilitated ) had better ratings in the fois scale compared to individuals with total prostheses . the results of the correlation between the fois scale and the oral health condition are shown in table 4 . in the statistical analysis between the degree of swallowing dysfunction and oral health condition , a significant negative correlation between the number of teeth and the swallowing performance of liquid in the lhg was found , demonstrating that the greater the number of teeth , the lower the degree of swallowing dysfunction . according to the kruskal wallis test , there was no difference in the performance of swallowing solid boluses depending on the type of prosthesis used in the lower dental arch ; in the hg , however , when applying the post - dunn s test , this difference was not confirmed ( p>0.05 ) . the comparison of the fois scale between the types of dental prostheses is shown in table 5 . the results of the correlation between the degree of dysphagia and the oral health condition are shown in table 6 , and the comparison of the degree of swallowing dysfunction between types of dental prostheses is described in table 7 . according to the literature , individuals affected by stroke often exhibit decreased level of consciousness , paralysis of the muscles involved in swallowing , sensory deficits of the pharynx and oral cavity , as well as loss of appetite.24 with these disorders related to swallowing , dysphagia becomes an important symptom in this population , and may be aggravated by teeth loss and the use of poorly fitting prosthesis , common during aging . furthermore , the hypothesis that oropharyngeal colonization is primarily responsible for the subsequent respiratory infection , owing to aspiration , is strongly supported by the literature.10 no literature studies have made the correlation between the findings of the swallowing performance and the condition of the oral health in elderly patients after stroke . the results of this study showed some correlations between the oral condition and the data of the swallowing performance even when elderly individuals affected by stroke were part of the heterogeneous group . besides the statistical analysis for the study group , in an attempt to reduce its heterogeneity , the subjects were divided according to the side of the motor impairment after stroke . former studies have suggested that dysphagia maybe associated with diffuse lesions in one or both hemispheres , anterior fossa , or brainstem , as swallowing has a bilateral cortical representation . it has been well established that the protection of the airways during swallowing requires a precise coordination with accurate movements of the structures involved and adequate propulsion of the bolus to the oropharynx and esophagus;25 thus , the motor ability for swallowing seems to be essential for this protection . in the hg and rhg , it was found that the higher the need for replacement of the prosthesis , the worse the rating in the fois scale ; ie , individuals with greater need for replacement of the prostheses had a greater perception in making more compensation and changes in their diet , which reflected the classification level of oral intake . the fois scale was developed to describe the functional level of the daily oral intake of food and liquid of a patient , considering the changes in diet and need for compensation during swallowing.20 these limitations and changes in oral intake result from patient perception and self - perception of swallowing ability that is impaired . therefore , from the results , it can be inferred that when there was a greater need for replacement of the prosthesis , the patient s perception of doing more compensation and dietary modifications is reflected in the classification of the fois scale . significant changes in oral condition can have a major effect on the functions of eating and drinking and on the nutritional status of elderly individuals and those with neurological diseases.26 thus , the selection of food is determined by the difficulty in chewing and swallowing of the individuals . missing teeth and the use of prosthesis cause changes in the chewing ability of the elderly according to the type of food , and influences the swallowing function;27 thus , soft or mashed foods are preferentially ingested by the elderly , due to the difficulty in mastication,28 showing that there is an influence of oral health condition on the selection of foods . besides the influence of the oral condition on swallowing , there was a difference between the types of prostheses and classification of the fois scale when the results of the evaluation of individuals with impaired right and left hemiplegia were analyzed separately . the difference between the types of prostheses could be confirmed by post - dunn s test in the lhg , and demonstrated that individuals with partial dentures had better ratings in the fois scale than individuals with complete prostheses . thus , we can infer that when there was partial prosthesis rehabilitation along with the presence of some dental elements , subjects needed less compensation and changes in the oral diet . in this sense , studies show that the use of prostheses in the edentulous contributes to the maintenance of the physiological process of swallowing in the elderly,29 the fixation of the prosthesis in the mandible,30 and the presence of natural elements enables greater preservation of functional swallowing . when comparing the swallowing performance according to the type of prosthesis used , there was no difference between the types of prostheses fitted in the lower dental arch in swallowing solids in the hg . studies in healthy elderly subjects demonstrate the importance of the oral condition in the performance of the oral phase of swallowing . changes in masticatory function related to the oral condition , such as difficulties biting and chewing food27 demonstrated an influence on the pharyngeal phase of swallowing , such as premature escape of food , waste retention in the vallecula and pyriform sinuses , and the presence of coughing and gagging.27 moreover , the absence of dental prosthesis can result in a longer duration of swallowing,29 and the chewing and swallowing difficulties in healthy older adults decreased after the replacement of removable total prostheses by mandibular implant - supported prostheses.30 the literature has shown positive effects in the swallowing function with the use of prostheses and the differences in swallowing performance with prostheses in the upper or inferior arches.8 a study with healthy elderly individuals showed the differences between the total duration of swallowing , the latency period before pharynx elevation , duration of preparatory and oral phase , when using or not using the dental prostheses.29 finally , in the lhg , it was observed that the smaller the number of teeth present , the worse the rating of dysphagia for liquid . although this study aimed at finding an influence of the presence and number of teeth on chewing and consequently on swallowing solids,1,27,28 it also demonstrates the influence of the oral condition on liquid swallowing for this population . according to tamura et al,2 especially for liquid food , which demands more coordination during swallowing , stability in the jaw is also required , so that there is greater stability of the hyolaryngeal complex . to start the pharyngeal phase , the rise of the hyoid bone by the suprahyoid muscles and laryngeal elevation should occur . to complement these events , the jaw must be stabilized by natural or rehabilitated teeth into the proper position , because when the elevation of the hyoid bone and larynx is insufficient , there is an increased risk of aspiration during swallowing . the findings of this study indicate that the oral health condition of elderly individuals after stroke in chronic phase showed an association with the level of oral intake and the degree of oropharyngeal dysphagia . the limitations of the study should be considered , one being the lack of access to the imaging examinations to characterize the individuals according to the type of stroke , damaged areas , and extent of injury , and heterogeneity of the time of brain involvement , in addition to the effects of medications and other comorbidities , which were not taken into account . also , owing to the small sample , strong correlations could not be observed , and a cause / effect relationship can not be determined . despite the limitations of this study , and the fact that hemiplegia does not necessarily represent a direct relationship with the injured brain hemisphere contralaterally , since cerebellum lesions may cause ipsilateral motor damages,31 the findings indicated that the level of oral intake was influenced by the condition or type of dental prostheses , regardless of the side of the body affected . on the other hand , the number of teeth were demonstrated to be related to the level of dysphagia in individuals with right hemiplegia , which shows that the oral health condition differentially affects the physiological responses of swallowing , influenced by the brain damage . considering the present sample , further research is necessary pertaining to the oral condition and the neurological involvement of individuals . in addition , these issues demonstrate the need for an interdisciplinary research team comprising dentists , physicians , speech pathologists , and other health professionals , so as to study and define the treatment and guidelines to patients and caretakers , in order to maintain the best oral health condition in the elderly presented with oropharyngeal dysphagia .","backgroundaccording to the literature , the occurrence of dysphagia is high in cases of stroke , and its severity can be enhanced by loss of teeth and the use of poorly fitting prostheses.objectiveto verify that the status of oral health influences the level of oral intake and the degree of swallowing dysfunction in elderly patients with stroke in chronic phase.methodsthirty elderly individuals affected by stroke in chronic phase participated . 
 all subjects underwent assessment of their oral condition , with classification from the functional oral intake scale ( fois ) and nasoendoscopic swallowing assessment to classify the degree of dysphagia . 
 the statistical analysis examined a heterogeneous group ( hg , n=30 ) and two groups designated by the affected body part , right ( rhg , n=8 ) and left ( lhg , n=11 ) , excluding totally dentate or edentulous individuals without rehabilitation with more than one episode of stroke.resultsthere was a negative correlation between the need for replacement prostheses and the fois scale for the hg ( p=0.02 ) and rhg ( p=0.01 ) . 
 differences in fois between types of prostheses of the upper dental arch in the lhg ( p=0.01 ) and lower dental arch in the rhg ( p=0.04 ) . a negative correlation was found between the number of teeth present and the degree of dysfunction in swallowing liquid in the lhg ( p=0.05 ) . 
 there were differences in the performance in swallowing solids between individuals without prosthesis and those with partial prosthesis in the inferior dental arch ( p=0.04 ) for the hg.conclusionthe need for replacement prostheses , type of prostheses , and the number of teeth of elderly patients poststroke in chronic phase showed an association with the level of oral intake and the degree of oropharyngeal dysphagia .",376
"brucellosis is endemic in low socio - economic countries like india and the prevalent species causing human infections are brucella melitensis and brucella abortus . contact with the infected animals , consumption of raw milk and ignorance regarding the disease , are the major risk factors . since clinical manifestations of this disease are protean in nature , laboratory help is a must in the diagnosis . in the laboratory , brucellosis although an array of serological tests is available , rose bengal plate test ( rbpt ) and serum agglutination test ( sat ) are the most widely used . the sensitivity of rbpt is considerably high , but its specificity is much lower when used to test individuals residing in an endemic area . in the same way , sat , used to confirm rbpt results , also has limitations of lack of sensitivity as well as specificity . apart from this , serological testing does not provide direct evidence for the presence of the pathogen , hence , isolation of brucella spp . from the clinical specimen many of the methods have been developed for culturing brucella spp . from blood specimen , including the conventional ruiz - castaneda ( castaneda ) method , automated systems , lysis concentration ( lc ) and clot culture . in general , blood culture for brucella is performed by conventional castaneda method where the blood specimen is directly inoculated in the liquid phase of the castaneda medium . although the results by this method are satisfactory in acute untreated cases , the incubation time required is very long . the isolation rate is markedly reduced in treated cases or sub - acute / chronic brucellosis patients . the earlier reports have shown an increase in isolation rate and decrease in recovery time by adapting lc technique . however , both conventional and lc methods require one more blood sample for culture once the serological test is found positive . as it is difficult to obtain one more blood specimen in ignorant patients , clot culture could be a better option . , an attempt has been made to compare lc , clot culture and conventional culture techniques for the isolation of brucella from blood specimen in an endemic area . blood culture by all the three techniques was performed in 169 out of 191 patients showing sat titer of 160 international units ( iu ) after obtaining written consent . depending on the duration of the disease , patients were divided into three groups as : acute ( < 8 weeks ) , sub - acute ( 8 - 52 weeks ) and chronic ( > 52 weeks ) brucellosis . patients were considered to have relapse / re - infection if symptoms reappeared within a year after the completion of antibrucellar treatment . five ml of blood was collected aseptically from patients with the clinical symptoms resembling brucellosis ( fever , malaise , joint pain , low backache , headache , and weight loss ) in a sterile , plastic screw capped bottle with 6 - 7 glass beads of 2 mm diameter . the specimen was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min ; the serum was separated aseptically and used for serology . blood sample for conventional and lc culture technique was collected from patients who had significant sat titers ( 160 iu ) . about 10 ml of blood was collected in adults and 5 ml in case of children . the specimen was equally distributed and processed for conventional blood culture and lc technique . the blood specimen was inoculated aseptically into the broth phase of castaneda 's biphasic medium consisting of brain heart infusion agar and broth with brucella selective supplement ( hi - media ) . , was employed with a minor modification . 5 ml of blood was added to 40 ml of sterile distilled water with 1.5 ml of 4% sodium citrate in adults and 2.5 ml was added to 20 ml of sterile distilled water with 0.75 ml of 4% sodium citrate in children , in a sterile screw caped centrifuge tube . the contents were gently mixed and the tubes were centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 30 min . the supernatant was discarded and the sediment was inoculated in the castaneda 's medium , instead of culture plate the blood clot preserved in the sterile screw capped plastic tube with glass beads after removal of serum was used for this method . the media were incubated at 37c with 10% co2 for a maximum of 30 days . sub - culturing was done by allowing the blood broth mixture to flow over the solid phase . the day of appearance of the first colony was recorded for comparison of growth rates . the isolates were identified based on colony morphology , gram stain , modified  zn  staining , co2 requirement , biochemical tests like oxidase and urease , h2s production for 4 days and growth in the presence of basic fuchsin ( 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 ) and thionin ( 1:25,000 , 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 ) . provisional confirmation and bio - typing of the isolate was done by performing slide agglutination test using b. abortus and b. melitensis monospecific antisera ( murex biotech ) . statistical analysis of the data was performed by graphpad instat software designed by graphpad software , inc . the blood specimen was inoculated aseptically into the broth phase of castaneda 's biphasic medium consisting of brain heart infusion agar and broth with brucella selective supplement ( hi - media ) . . 5 ml of blood was added to 40 ml of sterile distilled water with 1.5 ml of 4% sodium citrate in adults and 2.5 ml was added to 20 ml of sterile distilled water with 0.75 ml of 4% sodium citrate in children , in a sterile screw caped centrifuge tube . the contents were gently mixed and the tubes were centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 30 min . the supernatant was discarded and the sediment was inoculated in the castaneda 's medium , instead of culture plate . the blood clot preserved in the sterile screw capped plastic tube with glass beads after removal of serum was used for this method . the media were incubated at 37c with 10% co2 for a maximum of 30 days . sub - culturing was done by allowing the blood broth mixture to flow over the solid phase . the day of appearance of the first colony was recorded for comparison of growth rates . the isolates were identified based on colony morphology , gram stain , modified  zn  staining , co2 requirement , biochemical tests like oxidase and urease , h2s production for 4 days and growth in the presence of basic fuchsin ( 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 ) and thionin ( 1:25,000 , 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 ) . provisional confirmation and bio - typing of the isolate was done by performing slide agglutination test using b. abortus and b. melitensis monospecific antisera ( murex biotech ) . statistical analysis of the data was performed by graphpad instat software designed by graphpad software , inc . blood culture by all the three techniques was performed in 169 out of 191 patients . overall blood culture positivity was found to be 24.8% , 43.1% and 34.9% by conventional , lc and clot culture techniques respectively . the isolation rates in patients with acute , sub - acute , chronic brucellosis and relapse / reinfection by various culture techniques are given in table 1 . culture positivity by various culture techniques in different stages of brucellosis when compared with the conventional technique lc and clot culture techniques yielded growth in significantly more number of cases ( p < 0.0001 ) . the mean recovery time for conventional technique was 9.61 days ( standard deviations [ sd ] 1.68 ) , whereas with lc and clot culture techniques it was 4.08 ( sd  0.87 ; p < 0.0001 ) and 5.83 ( sd  1.37 ; p < 0.0001 ) respectively . in the acute stage , earliest growth by the conventional technique was seen on the 6 day where as it was on the 3 day with both lc and clot culture techniques . lc technique showed earlier growth in 96% blood cultures , before the first positive culture by conventional method was noted , whereas clot culture yielded earlier growth in 42.55% of cultures . maximum incubation time required for culture to be positive by lc , clot culture and conventional technique was 6 , 9 and 16 days respectively . after 16 day , no culture was found positive , though the cultures were incubated for 1 month . despite maximum aseptic precautions taken during collection and processing of the sample , contamination rate was high for clot culture ( 5.32% ) followed by lc ( 2.95% ) , may be due to more number of manipulations required for the procedure . in the present study , blood culture positivity was found to be 24.8% , 43.1% and 34.9% and the recovery time was 10 , 4 and 6 days by conventional , lc and clot culture techniques respectively . our findings suggest that lc and clot culture methods are more sensitive and require less time than conventional culture thereby helping in early detection of infection . among the lc and clot culture techniques , lc was better due to increased isolation rates and decreased recovery time . , the mean recovery time by lc in this study was 4.08 days , which is in agreement with espinosa et al . , but slightly more as compared to the results of 2 and 2.7 days by etemadi et al . , and mantur and mangalgi . in a study done by escamilla et al . , clot culture technique was found to be less sensitive and more labor - intensive when compared with the conventional method . conversely in our study , clot culture technique was more sensitive and also the recovery time was less when compared with the conventional method . , another advantage of this technique is that need for one more blood sample is alleviated . in a study by espinosa et al . , isolation rate was higher in sub - acute cases than in patients with acute brucellosis by lc technique . whereas far higher isolation rates in both acute and chronic stages have been reported by mantur and mangalgi . in our study , culture positivity rate was high in patients with acute followed by sub - acute brucellosis and none of the chronic cases grew brucella . as the patients in our study were not relieved of their symptoms over a long time , they switched on to many doctors before being diagnosed as brucellosis cases at our hospital , which could be an attribute for our lower isolation rates . history of minimum 3 - 4 courses of antibiotics was elicited in 116 ( 68.63% ) patients . in general , blood cultures are attempted to confirm the presumptive serological diagnosis . in india , especially in rural areas , due to the misperception that blood once lost is lost forever and blood loss enhances the disease ; it is difficult to obtain one more blood specimen for culture in seropositive individuals . in such situations and also in field conditions ( camps ) , wherein obtaining a second sample for culture is difficult , clot culture could be the optimal alternative . both lysis and clot culture require manipulations , which enhance the chances of laboratory infection and contamination , thereby necessitating strict biosafety and aseptic measures . we propose that for the isolation of brucella from blood specimen , lc method is better than conventional castaneda 's method as the isolation rate is high and the recovery time is less . clot culture is a better option when a second blood sample can not be obtained for culture . as lysis and clot culture techniques are sensitive , simple and inexpensive and yield earlier results , they can be adapted in the technically and economically backward areas where automated systems are far from reach . however , to prevent laboratory acquired infection , these methods are to be carried out in class ii biosafety cabinet with bsl-3 precautions .","background : isolation of brucella is the gold standard in the laboratory diagnosis of brucellosis . as brucella is intracellular and the number of circulating bacteria is usually low , removal / dilution of antibacterial substances , concentration of bacteria and optimal culture conditions may enhance the rate of isolation.aims and objectives : the objective of the following study was to compare the lysis concentration ( lc ) , clot culture and conventional castaneda blood culture techniques for the isolation rate and recovery time in the diagnosis of human brucellosis.materials and methods : blood cultures by lc , clot culture and conventional method were performed in 169 patients who had antibody titers 160 international units by the serum agglutination test.results:overall blood culture positivity was found to be 24.8% , 43.1% and 34.9% by conventional , lc and clot culture techniques in that order . 
 the mean recovery time by lc and clot culture techniques was significantly less than conventional method , resulting in an overall difference of nearly 6 and 4 days respectively.conclusions:for the isolation of brucella from blood , lc and clot culture techniques are better than the conventional technique .",240
"rabies diagnosis is based on fluorescent antibody testing ( fat ) in brain smears and inoculation of brain suspension either in mouse neuroblastoma cell cultures or intracerebrally in mice as confirmatory assays with high sensitivity and specificity for postmortem diagnosis [ 13 ] . these techniques are well suited for rapid and reliable routine diagnosis , if brain material is available . for other diagnostic specimens sampled intra vitam in case of clinical suspicion , for example , saliva , cerebrospinal fluid , or skin biopsies , more suited molecular techniques with excellent sensitivity have been developed and validated , mostly targeting the conserved nucleoprotein gene of the lyssavirus genome , for example , [ 410 ] . among these , there are protocols both for classical rt - pcr and for real - time rt - pcr , which adds speed , efficiency , contamination safety , and reliability to the technique combined with the potential to quantify the viral load [ 11 , 12 ] . a major advantage offered by these molecular techniques is the characterisation of viral isolates by sequencing the given amplification products followed by phylogenetic or phylogeographic analysis [ 1315 ] . the greatest challenge for these powerful novel techniques is the ever growing spectrum of known lyssavirus species / genotypes ( gt ) , probably all of which having the potential to cause animal and human rabies fatalities [ 16 , 17 ] . so far , 12 lyssavirus species and three as yet unclassified species have been identified . the development of classical simple or ( hemi)nested rt - pcr methods with particular emphasis on the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of lyssaviruses species has been published in a number of studies [ 1823 ] . also several real - time rt - pcr protocols suited for the broad detection or differentiation of several genotypes have been developed [ 9 , 2428 ] . is of particular interest for the rabies epidemiology in europe concerning the european bat lyssaviruses types 1 and 2 [ 2932 ] apart from classical rabies [ 33 , 34 ] . this assay uses genotype ( gt ) specific probes and fluorophore signals for direct differentiation of gt1 , gt5 , and gt6 in a single - tube reaction . the goal of this work was , based on a comprehensive review of the rich literature on the theme and adapting thereof , to develop , establish , and validate classical and real - time rt - pcr protocols for ( intravitam ) diagnosis of rabies and molecular - epidemiological characterisation of viral strains with the main emphasis on the growing number of known species / genotypes . all operations with potentially infectious material apart from centrifugation in closed tubes were performed in a class ii biological safety cabinet . frozen cell culture supernatants of rabies virus strains propagated previously on bhk-21 cells ( baby hamster kidney cells , atcc , manassas , usa ) were thawed , centrifuged at 2,000  g for 10  min at 4c , and filtrated using the millex - ha 450  nm filter ( millipore , cork , ireland ) . approximately 1  g of cerebellum , medulla oblongata , and hippocampus from unfixed , freshly obtained brain material was homogenized to a 20% brain suspension using a mortar and pestle , after addition of approximately 1  g of quartz sand ( merck kgaa , darmstadt , germany ) and 5  ml of modified eagle medium with earle 's salts with 2.2  g / l nahco3 ( bioswisstec ag , schaffhausen , switzerland ) supplemented with 5% penicillin 10,000  iu / ml ( bioswisstec ag , schaffhausen , switzerland ) and 20% foetal calf serum ( fcs ; paa laboratories gmbh , pasching , austria ) . the suspension was then decanted into a 5  ml tube ( 5  ml polystyrene round - bottom tube ; bd biosciences , erembodegem , belgium ) to let it sediment for 1 hour at 4c and subsequently centrifuged at 1,400  g for 10  min and filtrated as above . frozen brain suspensions from former mouse inoculation tests   were handled like frozen cell culture supernatant . 500  l of rna storage solution ( ambion , foster city , usa ) was added to 100200  l of fresh or previously frozen saliva samples or swabs , which were subsequently vortexed ( vortex genie 2 , tewis laborbedarf ag , berne , switzerland ) for 1  min and centrifuged in a biofuge pico ( heraeus holding gmbh , hanau , germany ) at 5,000  rpm for 10  min . cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) samples were diluted 1  :  2 to 1  :  4 with rna storage solution ( ambion , foster city , usa ) . skin biopsies were shaved , cut into small pieces with a sterile pair of scissors , and further processed as described for brain suspension . a panel of 31 lyssaviruses ( including 4 species ) was used to test the diagnostic performance of our pcr ( table 1 ) . stocks of viral strains were produced in neuroblastoma cells ( mna 42/13 ) as described for the rabies tissue culture infection test ( rtcit , described below ) . the maintenance medium used for the first passage was dulbecco 's mem supplemented with 0.5% neomycin 50  iu / ml ( bioswisstec ag , schaffhausen , switzerland ) , 5% tryptose phosphate ( bioconcept ltd . amimed , allschwil , switzerland ) , 1% nonessential amino acids ( bioswisstec ag , schaffhausen , switzerland ) , 3% foetal calf serum , and 1% l - glutamine 200  mm ( bioswisstec ag , schaffhausen , switzerland ) to which 1% diethylaminoethyl - dextran ( deae - dextran ; sigma - aldrich corporation , st . dulbecco 's mem with 10% foetal calf serum was used for the 3 consecutive passages . staining of the cells was performed after each passage using rabies dfa reagent ( millipore , livingston , uk ) as a conjugate . the standard fluorescent antibody test ( fat ) was performed with brain tissue samples as previously described . rabies tissue culture infection test ( rtcit ) using four consecutive passages on murine neuroblastoma cells [ 4143 ] was applied to clinical specimens like brain specimens , liquor , saliva , or skin biopsies . primers , probes , and synthetic dna were obtained from microsynth ( microsynth gmbh , balgach , switzerland ) . the location of suitable n - directed primers and probes for heminested rt - pcr and real - time rt - pcr , respectively , was chosen and evaluated based on published work [ 8 , 18 , 22 , 25 ] . using multiple sequence alignment ( clustalx 2.0.3 program [ 4446 ] ) of the n gene region of the available lyssavirus species rabv ( 33 sequences ) , lbv ( 4 sequences ) , mokv ( 5 sequences ) , duvv ( 4 sequences ) , eblv-1 ( 17 sequences ) , eblv-2 ( 14 sequences ) , ablv , aravan , khujand , irkut , and west caucasian bat ( each one ) from genbank ( national center for biotechnology information and national library of medicine , rockville pike , usa ) , variable positions of primers and probes were adjusted with wobble positions for a potentially broader match . several probes for real - time rt - pcr for broadening the spectrum of detectable species were designed in this work ( table 2 ) . as internal control for conventional rt - pcr , amplification of gapdh ( glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) was used . as internal inhibition control for real - time rt - pcr , primers and probes for the amplification of sendai virus ( atcc , manassas , usa ) , which was added to the samples before rna isolation , were used ( table 2 ) . synthetic dna with a length of 125 bases encompassing positions 48172 according to the pasteur virus genome ( x03673 ) of the following lyssavirus species were obtained from microsynth : aravan virus ( arav ) ef614259 , khujand virus ( khuv ) ef614261 , bokeloh bat lyssavirus ( bblv ) jf311903 , australian bat lyssavirus ( ablv ) af418014 , irkut virus ( irkv ) ef614260 , lagos bat virus ( lbv ) eu293110 , mokola virus ( mokv ) 293117 , shimoni bat virus ( shiv ) gu170201 , and west caucasian bat virus ( wcbv ) ef614258 . rna was isolated from 140  l of sample supernatant using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit ( qiagen , germantown , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , except the usage of rna storage solution ( ambion , foster city , usa ) for elution . heminested rt - pcr was performed as previously described   using the onestep rt - pcr kit . briefly , for the first round 3  l of extracted rna was amplified in the rt - pcr mix prepared according to manufacturer 's instructions , supplemented with 0.6  m of each primer ( jw12-f , jw6as1-r1 , and jw6as2-r1 ;

pcr enzyme mixed with 5  l of extracted rna to a total volume of 50  l . amplifications were performed in a veriti 96-well thermal cycler ( applied biosystems , foster city , usa ) using the following cycling conditions : 30  min at 50c , followed by 15  min at 95c and 40 repetitive cycles of 1  min at 94c , 1  min with a temperature gradient from 56c to 46c in steps of 2c , and 1  min at 72c . after gel electrophoresis excised pcr fragments with a length of 933  bp were eluted with the qiaquick gel extraction kit ( qiagen , germantown , usa ) and cloned into the pcr - ii - topo vector using the topo ta cloning kit ( invitrogen , foster city , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . sequencing reactions were performed by microsynth ag , balgach , switzerland . for this purpose , reaction mixtures containing 22.5  ng dna per 100  bp , 30  pmol of each primer used for the amplification ( table 2 ) , and depc treated water ( ambion , foster city , usa ) to a final volume of 15  l were prepared . sequences were edited using the seqman ii v5.01 software ( dnastar , madison , usa ) and subsequently evaluated using the clone manager 9 software ( scientific & educational software , cary , usa ) . the 543  bp nucleotide sequences of the nucleoprotein gene obtained from the heminested pcr reaction , together with additional sequences retrieved from genbank , were saved in fasta file format . the sequences were then aligned using the clustalx 2.0.3 software and the genedoc software v2.5.0 . thirty - one lyssaviruses ( 19x rabv , 7x eblv-1 , 4x eblv-2 , and 1x duvv ) were analysed in rtcit . all isolates were viable in murine neuroblastoma cells and could be visualized using rabies dfa reagent as a conjugate . for the comparison with infectious titres , rna of the classical rabies virus strain cvs-11 was extracted from cell culture supernatants ( bhk-21 cells or neuroblastoma cells mna 42/13 ) and serially diluted from 10 to 10 . the infectious titre was determined according to the spearman - karber formula [ 49 , 50 ] in fluorescent focus forming doses 50% ( ffd50 ) . in the heminested rt - pcr ( hnrt - pcr ) , the amplification product of 582  bp was visible up to a dilution of 10 corresponding to a detection limit of 0.4 ffd50 ( 10 ffd50 ; figure 1 ) . in the real - time rt - pcr ( ndwd ) the limit of detection was defined as the last dilution at which at least 2 out of 3 replicates were positive . using this definition , cvs-11 was detectable up to a dilution of 10 ( once at a dilution of 10 ) . the amplification plot showed regular intervals of the curves with ct - values from 18.1 ( dilution 10 ) to 40.0 ( dilution 10 ) . relating to infectious titre real - time rt - pcr reached a detection limit of 0.003 ffd50 ( 10 ) for cvs-11 . the efficiency of the real - time rt - pcr ( ndwd ) was determined using linear regression of the ct - values and the titres of the samples ( figure 2 ) . on the basis of the slope coefficient the limit of detection in terms of dna copy numbers was determined using 10-fold serial dilutions of a cloned 933  bp segment of n of cvs-11 containing 10 to 10 dna copies / pcr reaction . in the hnpcr , the limit of detection was 100 dna copies/3  l of starting material of the cvs-11 plasmid . in the real - time pcr ( ndwd ) , the 10-fold serial dilution of the cvs - plasmid was tested in triplicate . the limit of detection was 10 dna copies/2  l of the cvs-11 plasmid with ct - values between 38.6 and 47.5 . the efficiency was at 82.8% with a slope coefficient of 3.82 ( not shown ) . the intra - assay repeatability of the real - time pcr ( ndwd ) proved to be excellent with very low coefficients of variation up to 10 dna copies ( 0.181.37% ) with and outlier at 10 copies ( 12.05% ; table 3 ) . a total of 31 lyssaviruses ( 19 identified as classical rabv , 7 as eblv-1 , 4 as eblv-2 , and 1 as duvv ) were used to test the diagnostic performance of the pcr ( table 1 ) . all viruses used were detected with the expected band size in the hnrt - pcr technique ( table 4 ) . the specificity of the amplified product was confirmed as rabv , eblv-1 , eblv-2 , or duvv by sequencing in each case . host gapdh ( glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) was detected in all of the cell culture supernatants and mouse brain suspensions as internal control , indicating that sample material was present and rna isolation , reverse transcription , and amplification were not inhibited . all samples were also tested positive by the real - time rt - pcr assay ( table 4 ) . sendai virus as internal control for inhibition was run in parallel using the same cycling conditions . in the real - time rt - pcr ( ndwd ) with an annealing temperature of 50c , some samples were detected with more than one probe . with the exception of the sample derived from a raccoon dog from poland , the probe for the homologous genotype always yielded the lowest ct - value . in this exceptional case , the probe for the detection of genotype 6 was slightly lower than the one for genotype 1 ( 15.0 versus 16.1 ; table 4 ) . comparison of these two probes with the sequence of the rabies variant in question showed 1 and 2 mismatches with the rabvd1-p and lysgt6-p probe , respectively ( figure 3 ) . duvenhage virus , also designated as genotype 4 , was detectable with the probe adapted for genotype 6 in spite of 3 mismatches ( lysgt6-p ) . the probe lysgt6-p was able to detect synthetic dna fragments of bblv , arav , and irkv , although containing one or two mismatches , respectively . the synthetic dna fragments of khuv , ablv , lbv , mokv , shibv , and wcbv , which exhibited from four ( ablv / khuv ) up to ten ( wcbv ) mismatches to the best fitting probe for gt1 , gt6 , or gt5 , respectively , were all detected with the corresponding species - specific new probe ( table 2 ) . 10 copies of the synthetic dna were detected at ct - values of 27.933.5 for ablv , mokv , shibv , and wcbv ( not shown ) . the efficiency of detection of khuv , which showed an atypical amplification plot at the highest number of 10 copies of the synthetic dna , and that of lbv was lower with ct - values of 40.0 and 40.5 at a copy number of 10 , respectively ( not shown ) . multiplexing of combinations of these probes ( ivvlbv - p ( fam : 6-carboxyfluorescein ) , ivvkhujand - p ( yy : yakima yellow ) , and ivvsblv2-p ( cy5 : cyanine 5 ) , as well as ivvwcbv - p ( fam ) , ivvmok - p ( yy ) , and ivvablv2n - p ( cy5 ) ) as for the species 1 , 5 , and 6 was not successful . the 543  bp amplification products of the nucleoprotein gene obtained in the heminested pcr reactions were sequenced ( table 1 ) and analysed phylogenetically with additional sequences retrieved from genbank representing all known lyssaviruses . the similarity of the 543  bp nucleotide sequences of the nucleoprotein gene ( positions 74616 according to the pasteur virus genome ) among the lyssaviruses included ranged from 64.6% to 90.1% ( hamming distance ) . the resulting phylogenetic tree obtained by the neighbor - joining method implemented in the mega5 software is presented in figure 4 . clinical specimens like brain suspensions ( 1x human , 12x mouse ) , skin biopsies from the nape of the neck ( 3x human , 1x mouse ) , saliva ( 4x human ) , and cerebrospinal fluids ( 6x human ) were used for the establishment of the assays . both hnrt - pcr and real - time rt - pcr ( ndwd ) were shown to work properly on all these samples without significant inhibition using gapdh as internal control for conventional rt - pcr and sendai virus for real - time rt - pcr ( ndwd ) , which was mixed to the samples before rna isolation . skin biopsies taken from the neck and lip of a mouse ( white swiss mouse at an age of 3 weeks ) euthanized 2 weeks after intracerebral infection with sad bern virus 20 years ago were positive with the hnrt - pcr and real - time pcr ( ndwd ) . skin biopsies taken from other locations on the head were positive with the real - time pcr ( ndwd ) and weakly positive in hnrt - pcr whereas samples taken around the vibrissae were weakly positive in real - time pcr ( ndwd ) only . sequencing of amplification products excluded a contamination with the positive cvs-11 control ( not shown ) . brain suspension from an imported human rabies case in 2012 was already strongly positive after one round of the hnrt - pcr . phylogenetic analysis of the 543  bp nucleotide fragment revealed its close relationship to the classical rabies virus strains circulating in the insectivorous mexican free - tailed bat , tadarida brasiliensis , a species common in the southern united states and mexico . this allowed identification of the origin of the patient 's infection , who had travelled extensively and did not report any previous biting incident [ 51 , 52 ] . based on a large amount of published work , we were able to establish and quantitatively characterise rt - pcr protocols for the detection of lyssaviruses in clinical samples . well suited real - time protocols [ 8 , 25 ] for the detection of classical rabies virus and the genotypes 5 and 6 ( eblv-1 and eblv-2 ) were adapted and extended for the detection of at least 13 lyssavirus species . to this goal , 6 species - specific probes ( khuv , ablv , lbv , mokv , shibv , and wcbv ) were designed and verified on synthetic dna fragments encompassing the targeted sequence of the lyssaviral nucleoprotein gene . multiplexing the probes in a single - tube reaction as described for the genotypes 1 , 5 , and 6 was not possible with the newly designed probes , probably due to false priming and/or interference within the mix of reagents and synthetic target sequence . as far as evaluated with the multiplexed probes for the genotypes 1 , 5 , and 6 using 31 viral isolates , which were all detectable with high sensitivity , direct differentiation of targeted genotypes on the base of the quantitative reaction ( ct - values ) was mostly possible . furthermore , a single probe for genotype 6 ( species eblv-2 ) was able to detect up to 7 genotypes / species . we consider this type of cross hybridization as an advantage of the technique using degenerate primers and probes in terms of a broad detectability of lyssavirus rather than a lack of accuracy of discrimination . in an approach using sybr green qpcr with similarly degenerate primers spanning the same part of n as in this work , the detection of all lyssavirus species known at that time was achieved . using several genotype - specific probes in a taqman real - time protocol , we were able to add more intrinsic confidence to the specificity of the analysis . quantitative characterisation of the assay using the probe for genotypes 1 , 5 , and 6 on cvs-11 showed excellent sensitivity and repeatability with a detection limit of as low as an infectious dose of 0.003 ffd50 combined with an analytical sensitivity of 10 dna copies at efficiencies of 94.5% and 82.8% , respectively . considering the amount of degeneration in both primers and probes , the efficiencies determined must be considered satisfactory . as far as the absolute detection limit in terms of target copies is concerned , the usage of plasmid dna rather than rna must be kept in mind . since reverse transcription can not be assumed as 100% efficient and reproducible , the limit for rna might be somewhat lower . for further characterisation of samples with a positive reaction in real - time rt - pcr , excellent simple and ( hemi)nested rt - pcr protocols are available . with the protocol used for this work , all 31 viral strains used could be amplified and sequenced , confirming the diagnostic broadness of the assay . phylogenetic analysis of these partial nucleotide sequences belonging to genotypes 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 along with known sequences confirmed the suitability of this relatively conserved genomic region for molecular - epidemiological characterisation of lyssaviruses circulating worldwide [ 5658 ] . this was also confirmed in the context of a human rabies case imported to switzerland in 2012 , which could be attributed unequivocally to an exposure to a bat of the species tadarida brasiliensis in california , usa . in this work we could show and validate the suitability of an adapted and further developed real - time rt - pcr protocol for the rapid , efficient , and highly sensitive intravitam diagnosis of a wide spectrum of lyssavirus species followed by rapid molecular - epidemiological characterisation of viral isolates respective to origin of the virus and source of exposure , using heminested rt - pcr . this new tool is also particularly promising for active surveillance of european bat lyssaviruses using oral swabs in live - captured bats .","the causative agents of rabies are single - stranded , negative - sense rna viruses in the genus lyssavirus of rhabdoviridae , consisting of twelve classified and three as yet unclassified species including classical rabies virus ( rabv ) . 
 highly neurotropic rabv causes rapidly progressive encephalomyelitis with nearly invariable fatal outcome . 
 rapid and reliable diagnosis of rabies is highly relevant for public and veterinary health . due to growing variety of 
 the genus lyssavirus observed , the development of suitable molecular assays for diagnosis and differentiation is challenging . 
 this work focused on the establishment of a suitable real - time rt - pcr technique for rabies diagnosis as a complement to fluorescent antibody test and rabies tissue culture infection test as gold standard for diagnosis and confirmation . 
 the real - time rt - pcr was adapted with the goal to detect the whole spectrum of lyssavirus species , for nine of which synthesized dna fragments were used . for the detection of species , seven probes were developed . 
 serial dilutions of the rabies virus strain cvs-11 showed a 100-fold higher sensitivity of real - time pcr compared to heminested rt - pcr . using a panel of thirty - one lyssaviruses representing four species , 
 the suitability of the protocol could be shown . 
 phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained by heminested pcr allowed correct classification of all viruses used .",290
"a 55-year - old woman visited the emergency clinic of hanyang university seoul hospital with chest pain that had persisted for one month and had become aggravated two days earlier . ten years before this admission , the patient had undergone double valve replacement with aortic and mitral mechanical valves due to aortic regurgitation and mitral steno - insufficiency . echocardiography revealed normal motion and function of the mitral and aortic valve prostheses , and coronary angiography findings were also normal . however , coronary computed tomographic angiography revealed three large lobulated aneurysms with calcified walls bulging from the base of the left ventricle ( fig . the leak in the left ventricle was located in the sub - mitral valve prosthesis area . based on this finding , we diagnosed the patient with a pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricle , and surgical treatment was planned . arterial cannulation via the left femoral artery and venous cannulation via the left femoral vein and left pulmonary artery were performed . three communicating aneurysmal sacs were observed in a single plane , identical to that observed in coronary computed tomographic angiography . the neck of the first sac was located at the base of the left ventricle . under cardiopulmonary bypass and fibrillation , a defect measuring 15 mm in diameter was identified in the sub - mitral left ventricular wall with calcification but with no infection . closure of the defect was performed with a supple peri - guard pericardium patch with apex processing ( synovis , st . the walls of the aneurysmal sacs were closed , and the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without difficulty . the vital signs of the patient remained stable , and she was extubated six hours after the operation . follow - up echocardiography was performed on postoperative day eight , and no abnormal findings , including cardiac wall motion , were noted . no leakage at the closed aneurysmal neck was observed , and there was no evidence of recurrence of the pseudoaneurysm ( fig . she has remained disease - free for six years postoperatively , with regular coumadin anticoagulation therapy due to the presence of the prosthetic aortic and mitral valves . a left ventricular ( lv ) pseudoaneurysm , or false aneurysm , is defined as a contained rupture or perforation of the myocardium . the rupture of the myocardium occurs rarely in clinical practice ; it is most often associated with myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery , such as mitral valve replacement ( mvr ) , and is usually fatal [ 24 ] . in 1980 , cobb et al . roberts and morrow   suggested that inadvertent invasion into the lv free wall is possible during excision of the mitral valve if there is poor visualization of the operating field when using the tips of the scissors . other causes of complete or incomplete rupture of the lv free wall include an oversized prosthetic valve , excessive extirpation of calcium in the mitral annulus , myocardial erosion caused by the struts of the prosthetic valve , the untethering of the fibrous structures of the left ventricle during resection of mitral leaflets , an increase in lv contractility after aortic cross- clamping , enhanced lv wall stress with the support of inotropic agents , and other mechanical trauma between the free wall and the papillary muscles , such as rubber catheter wedging or metal pump suction during valve replacement . the wall of a false aneurysm comprises the fibrous obliteration of the pericardial sac , resulting from adhesion between the parietal and visceral layer of the pericardium . while a true aneurysm has nonrestrictive continuity with the lv cavity , a pseudoaneurysm has a defect in the myocardial continuity and a well - defined neck , representing a history of lv wall perforation . thus , such pseudoaneurysms are more likely to undergo rapid enlargement and rupture than true aneurysms . therefore , surgical correction , including the resection of the aneurysmal sac and patch repair or primary closure of the aneurysmal neck , is indicated and recommended for pseudoaneurysms . in the present case , we diagnosed a lv pseudoaneurysm using coronary computed tomographic angiography . myocardial infarction was excluded as a cause of the lv pseudoaneurysm because coronary angiography revealed normal findings and cardiac markers were in the normal range , although electrocardiography revealed myocardial ischemia in the inferior wall . the cause of lv pseudoaneurysm in our patient was a late - term complication of mvr . echocardiography revealed normal function of the mitral valve prosthesis ; therefore , mitral reoperation was not indicated . in such patients , if a repeat sternotomy for entering the operative field is considered , it may be difficult to approach the heart due to massive pericardial adhesions , and the possibility of injury or rupture of the pseudoaneurysm during dissection may be higher . a direct approach to the operative field via a left lateral thoracotomy can avoid these complications and preserve the previously implanted prosthetic valves . further , it has other advantages , such as making it easier to establish cardiopulmonary bypass and obviating the need to cross - clamp the aorta , in contrast to the sternotomy approach . in our operation , a fibrillator was used and the exposure of the operative field was excellent . in the operative field , we found three large lobulated pseudoaneurysms with calcified walls in a line , bulging from the base of the left ventricle . the configuration of the pseudoaneurysms suggested a previous episode of lv rupture , which had developed over time . in patients with lv pseudoaneurysms , there is a well - defined approach to surgical correction . the neck of the pseudoaneurysm is dissected , and the perforated site can be closed by patch repair or primarily . the mortality rate of this surgery is approximately 10% . , we have reported a case of lv pseudoaneurysm that occurred as a late complication after mvr . we performed a left lateral thoracotomy via the fifth intercostal space to approach the operative field directly and successfully repaired the sub - mitral lv pseudoaneurysm using a prosthetic patch . a few cases of lv pseudoaneurysms have been previously reported ; however , no case reports have previously been presented of korean patients with an lv pseudoaneurysm following mvr who were treated with an operative technique employing a left lateral thoracotomy .","we present a case of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm , which is a very rare and fatal complication of cardiac procedures such as mitral valve replacement .

"super scan  is a well described phenomenon on skeletal scintigraphy which is characterized by high skeletal to soft tissue ratio , uniform symmetrically increased bone uptake , and absent renal visualization . sye , et al . hypothesized that diseased bone shows increased uptake of radiopharmaceutical leading to reduced phosphate excretion and production of faint renal images on bone scan . we report a case of f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) positron emission tomography ( pet ) super scan which shows features akin to super scan of skeletal scintigraphy and resolution of these features following initial phase of chemotherapy . a twelve - year old male presented with multiple joint pains , periorbital and sternal swellings of one - month duration . contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the abdomen revealed poorly enhancing , hypodense bilateral renal masses ranging from 4 cm to 5 cm in size along with multiple hepatic and pancreatic space occupying lesions . a 4.3-cm exophytic mass was noted in the lower pole of right kidney [ figure 1 ] . ct - guided biopsy from this mass revealed feature of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( pnet)/ewing 's sarcoma [ figure 2 ] . contrast - enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed poorly enhancing , hypodense bilateral renal masses ranging from 4 cm to 5 cm in size along with multiple hepatic and pancreatic space occupying lesions . a 4.3-cm exophytic mass was noted in the lower pole of right kidney histology of renal biopsy specimen from the lesion ( h and e staining , 10 ) showing sheets of malignant small round blue cells .

( c ) tumor cells were also negative for other markers in the round cell panel namely cytokeratin , leukocyte - common antigen , desmin , and synaptophysin ( not shown here ) . the findings are those of primitive neuroectodermal tumor / ewing 's sarcoma of the kidney thereafter , patient underwent a  true whole body pet scan including bilateral limbs and skull region as per the standard institution protocol for pre - treatment staging of the disease . the images revealed extensive hypermetabolic areas in ct described renal ( suvmax : 6.9 ) , hepatic ( suvmax : 7.2 ) , and pancreatic lesions ( suvmax : 5.4 ) . in addition , intense and non - uniform uptake was seen in marrows of axial and appendicular skeletal system with distinct focus in palpable sternal swelling ( suvmax : 4.5 ) . a medium - sized focus was also seen in left posterior chest wall with extension into basal pleura of left lung . interestingly , low background tracer concentration was observed along with very low f-18 fdg uptake in the brain ( suvmax of 3.3 in occipital region and 2.9 in rest of the brain ) , skeletal muscles of limb , mediastinum , and bowel . due to its resemblance with super scan of skeletal scintigraphy , these scan findings can be termed to represent  pet super scan  [ figure 3 ] . true  whole body pet scan including bilateral limbs and skull region shows extensive hypermetabolic areas in computed tomography described renal ( suvmax : 6.9 ) , hepatic ( suvmax : 7.2 ) , and pancreatic lesions ( suvmax : 5.4 ) . intense and non - uniform uptake was seen in marrows of axial and appendicular skeletal system with distinct focus in palpable sternal swelling ( suvmax : 4.5 ) and in left posterior chest wall with extension into basal pleura of left lung . scan shows low background tracer concentration with very low f-18 fdg uptake in the brain ( suvmax of 3.3 in occipital region and 2.9 in rest of the brain ) , skeletal muscles of limb , mediastinum , and bowel . due to its resemblance with super scan of skeletal scintigraphy patient was subjected to six cycles of euro - ewing 99 protocol including vincristine , ifosfamide , doxorubicin , and etoposide chemotherapeutic regimen as per the institution protocol . repeat pet scans were done after three and six cycles , latter being done after 4 months of the initial scan [ figure 4a ] . the images revealed marked treatment response with disappearance of  super scan-like pattern , reduction in number , size , and metabolic activity of the lesions that were shown in the earlier scan . suvmax of the occipital region of the brain increased from the previous value of 3.3 to 9.9 . for rest of the brain , the suvmax increased from 2.9 to 8.6 [ figure 4b ] . the comparison of femoral marrow activity in the pre- and post - treatment scans showed hypermetabolic areas of stimulation in post - treatment scan , which is clearly missing from the previously diseased marrow and gcsf - induced stimulated marrow being seen in previously uninvolved marrow . we have termed this pattern as  marrow flip flop  and it appears that areas showing marrow flip flop are the ones that demonstrate treatment response [ figure 4c ] . repeat pet scans were done after three and six cycles , latter being done after 4 months of the initial scan the images show marked treatment response with disappearance of  super scan-like pattern , reduction in number , size , and metabolic activity of the lesions that were shown in the earlier scan . suvmax of the occipital region of the brain increased from the previous value of 3.3 to 9.9 . for rest of the brain , the suvmax increased from 2.9 to 8.6 the comparison of femoral marrow activity in the pre- and posttreatment scans shows hypermetabolic areas of stimulation in post - treatment scan , which is clearly missing from the previously diseased marrow and g - cs - finduced stimulated marrow being seen in previously uninvolved marrow termed as  marrow flip flop it is an extremely rare malignant tumor with fewer than 50 cases in english literature . renal pnet is still rarer in children and adolescents age group with only four cases being reported in the pediatric age group.[57 ] to the best of our knowledge , we are reporting fifth such case . it usually presents in advance stage , behaves more aggressively than pnet at other sites , and usually shows poor response to the chemotherapy . similar characteristics of diffuse and intense hypermetabolism throughout the skeleton have been described in the earlier publications.[911 ] however , the scan in this case shows a very high contrast between the metastatic and non - metastatic organs with extremely low f-18 fdg uptake in brain , muscles of limbs , mediastinum , and bowel . unique feature of this case is demonstration of reversal of aforementioned f-18 fdg avidity after initial chemotherapy in the follow - up scan . another unusual feature of this case is the excellent chemotherapeutic response shown in this patient ; pnet of kidney is known to respond poorly to chemotherapy and a functional imaging modality may serve as a useful tool to demonstrate early response in such rare cases . marrow flip flop  could be due to involved marrow being replaced by fibrosis as a treatment response and hence would not demonstrate the marrow stimulation effect of colony - stimulating factors on a pet scan done to assess therapeutic response . in conclusion , though uncommon , the reporting physician should be aware of findings of  pet super scan  as demonstrated in this patient . reversal of these abnormalities on functional imaging following therapy guides the clinician to choose the best available regimen for this otherwise chemotherapy nave disease .","we report f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg )  positron emission tomography ( pet ) super scan  akin to  super scan  of conventional skeletal scintigraphy , in a rare case of primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( pnet ) of the kidney . 
 a twelve year old male patient of metastatic pnet of the kidney was subjected to a  true 
 whole body f-18 fdg pet scan including lower limbs and skull region as per the institution protocol . 
 the images revealed extensive hypermetabolic areas corresponding to the computed tomography described renal , hepatic , and pancreatic lesions along with intense and non - uniform uptake in the marrows of axial and appendicular skeletal system . 
 interestingly , low background tracer concentration was observed along with very low f-18 fdg uptake in the brain , skeletal muscles of limb , mediastinum , and bowel . in view of these findings 
 , the scan can be interpreted as  pet super scan  due to its resemblance with the super scan of skeletal scintigraphy . a repeat f-18 fdg pet scan after chemotherapy revealed marked treatment response with disappearance of 
 super scan-like pattern , reduction in number , size , metabolic activity of the lesions , and stimulated marrow sans the previously diseased portion . 
 though uncommon , the reporting physician should be aware of  pet super scan  and its implications as described in this case .",279
"a lot of research has been done in the past , and still research is going on to explore tools and techniques for regeneration of lost tissues as a result of the disease process . the use of various grafts and recent tissue engineering techniques including stem cell research are testimony to the ever increasing need for most suitable treatment option to replace / repair lost tissues due to various pathologic processes . the use of autogenous periosteum in general medical treatment has been extensive and has shown promising results [ 13 ] ; on the contrary in dentistry , the use of periosteum as a regenerative tool has been limited and highly underrated ; therefore , the purpose of this paper is to highlight the current status of use of periosteum in dentistry as well as suggesting its future use in various treatment options related specifically to dental field . the periosteum is a highly vascular connective tissue sheath covering the external surface of all the bones except for sites of articulation and muscle attachment ( figure 1 ) . the periosteum comprises of at least two layers , an inner cellular or cambium layer , and an outer fibrous layer   . the inner layer contains numerous osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells , and the outer layer is composed of dense collagen fiber , fibroblasts , and their progenitor cells ; osteogenic progenitor cells from the periosteal cambium layer may work with osteoblasts in initiating and driving the cell differentiation process of bone repair characterized by the development of the initial fracture callus and subsequent remodeling . periosteum can be described as an osteoprogenitor cell containing bone envelope , capable of being activated to proliferate by trauma , tumors , and lymphocyte mitogens . research on the structure of periosteum has shown that it is made up of three discrete zones . zone 1 has an average thickness of 1020  um consisting predominantly of osteoblasts representing 90% of cell population , while collagen fibrils comprise 15% of the volume . the majority of cells in zone 2 are fibroblasts , with endothelial cells being most of the remainder . zone 3 has the highest volume of collagen fibrils and fibroblasts among all the three zones . the morphology of fibroblasts is variable across the three zones ( figure 2 ) . it is thicker , more vascular , active , and loosely attached as compared to adults where it is thinner , less active , and firmly adherent .   in all age groups , the cells of the periosteum retain the ability to differentiate into fibroblasts , osteoblasts , chondrocytes , adipocytes , and skeletal myocytes . the tissues produced by these cells include cementum with periodontal ligament fibers and bone . the periosteum has a rich vascular plexus and is regarded as the  umbilical cord of bone  . the vasculature system of the periosteum was first studied in detail by zucman and later by eyre - brook .bourke 's studies showed that the capillaries supplying blood to bone reside within the cortex linking the medullary and periosteal vessels ; a recent study has even shown that periosteal cells release vascular endothelial growth factor   which promote revascularization during wound healing . recently , studies have reported the existence of osteogenic progenitors , similar to mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) , in the periosteum [ 12 , 13 ] . under the appropriate culture conditions , the periosteum can be easily harvested from the patient 's own oral cavity , where the resulting donor site wound is invisible . owing to the above reasons , the periosteum offers a rich cell source for bone tissue engineering ; hence , the regenerative potential of periosteum is immense . developing bone substitutes for bone defect repair has inspired orthopedic surgeons , bone biologists , bioengineering researchers to work together in order to design and develop the promising products for clinical applications . duhame in the year 1742 can be considered the first investigator to study the osteogenic potential of periosteum and published his findings in the article  sur le development et la crueded os des animaux  . a century later , another french surgeon , ollier , discovered that the transplanted periosteum could induce de novo bone formation . one of the earliest experimental studies to demonstrate osteogenic potential of periosteum was that of urist and mclean who reported that periosteum produced bone when transplanted to the anterior chamber of the eye of the rat . skoog subsequently introduced the use of periosteal flaps for closure of maxillary cleft defects in humans ; he reported the presence of new bone in cleft defects within 36 months following surgery . since then , surgeons have reported the successful use of maxillary periosteal flaps [ 18 , 19 ] as well as periosteal grafts from the tibia or rib . melcher observed that new bone is laid down in parietal bone defects of rats and was deposited by periosteum that had not been previously elevated or disturbed in any other way , while other investigators have suggested that the contact between the periosteal flap or graft and the underlying bone is crucial to stimulation of osteogenesis [ 21 , 22 ] . more recently , the osteogenic / chondrogenic capacity of periosteum and related mechanisms have been confirmed , and the underlying biology is better understood through a number of studies [ 2340 ] . various research papers have been published explaining the osteogenic potential of human periosteal grafts [ 41 , 42 ] . the use of periosteum as a gtr has been suggested by many studies [ 4346 ] , although long - term results are still awaited to establish the regular and the most effective use of periosteal grafts as barrier membranes . the need for a graft , which has its own blood supply , which can be harvested adjacent to the recession defect in sufficient amounts without requiring any second surgical site and has a potential of promoting the regeneration of lost periodontal tissue is a long - felt need . the adult human periosteum is highly vascular and is known to contain fibroblasts and their progenitor cells , osteoblasts and their progenitor cells , and stem cells . in all the age groups , the cells of the periosteum retain the ability to differentiate into fibroblasts , osteoblasts , chondrocytes , adipocytes , and skeletal myocytes . the tissues produced by these cells include cementum with periodontal ligament fibers and bone ; in addition the presence of periosteum adjacent to the gingival recession defects in sufficient amounts make it a suitable graft . recent papers published have shown promising results with the use of periosteum in the treatment of gingival recession defects ( figure 3 ) [ 47 , 48 ] ; moreover , with the advancement in tissue engineering techniques the periosteal derived stem cells have been grown effectively to reconstruct lost tissues . periosteum - derived progenitor cells may serve as an optimal cell source for tissue engineering based on their accessibility , ability to proliferate rapidly , and capability to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages . the periosteum is a specialized connective tissue that forms a fibrovascular membrane covering all bone surfaces except for that of articular cartilage , muscle , and tendon insertions and sesamoid bones . cells residing within the periosteum may be excised from any number of surgically accessible bone surfaces ; in addition , when properly stimulated , the periosteum has the potential to serve as a bioreactor supporting a dramatic increase in the progenitor cell population over the course of a few days . further , once the cells are removed from the periosteum , they have the potential to proliferate at much higher rates than bone marrow , cortical bone , or trabecular bone - derived progenitor cells . in addition to their robust proliferation aptitude , it is well established that periosteum - derived progenitor cells have the potential to differentiate into both bone and cartilage . further , their potential for regenerating both bone and cartilage constructs is superior to that of adipose - derived progenitor cells and comparable with that of bone marrow - derived mesenchymal stem cells . a recent study by de bari et al . indicates that periosteal progenitor cells are able to differentiate not only into bone and cartilage cells but also into adipocyte and skeletal myocyte cells . there is a growing requirement for dentists to regenerate alveolar bone as a regenerative therapy for periodontitis and in implant dentistry . concerning the donor site , it is easier for general dentists to harvest periosteum than marrow stromal cells , because they can access the mandibular periosteum during routine oral surgery ; also the regenerative potential of periosteum has been effectively used in  osteodistraction  which has the benefit of simultaneously increasing the bone length and the volume of surrounding tissues . although distraction technology has been used mainly in the field of orthopedics , early results in humans  indicated that the process can be applied to correct deformities of the jaw . these techniques are now utilized extensively by maxillofacial surgeons for the correction of micrognathia , midface , and fronto - orbital hypoplasia in patients with craniofacial deformities . the use of periosteum can revolutionize the success of various dental treatments which require either bone or soft tissue regeneration ; particularly the future use of periosteum must be explored in periodontal and implant surgical procedures . although the regenerative potential of periosteum has been proved by numerous studies , till date the use of periosteum - derived grafts has still not become a standard tool in the armamentarium of dental surgeons , and it may still need some time , and further research before the full regenerative potential of periosteum is utilized .","the ultimate goal of any dental treatment is the regeneration of lost tissues and alveolar bone . under the appropriate culture conditions , periosteal cells secrete extracellular matrix and 
 form a membranous structure . 
 the periosteum can be easily harvested from the patient 's own oral cavity , where the resulting donor site wound is invisible . 
 owing to the above reasons , the periosteum offers a rich cell source for bone tissue engineering ; hence , the regenerative potential of periosteum is immense . 
 although the use of periosteum as a regenerative tool has been extensive in general medical field , the regenerative potential of periosteum is highly underestimated in dentistry ; therefore , the present paper reviews the current literature related to the regenerative potential of periosteum and gives an insight to the future use of periosteum in dentistry .",167
"spinal epidural abscess ( sea ) is a rare severe infection and accounts for 2.53.0 cases per 10,000 admissions in general hospitals . several sea risk factors , such as injection - drug use , diabetes mellitus , and several illnesses have been identified , however , no report has described sea associated with abortion . we report a case of post - abortion sea caused by the bacteroides fragilis group , which was managed successfully with antibiotics and surgical drainage . a 30-year - old woman was transferred to our hospital for fever and posterior cervical pain . two weeks before admission , dilation and curettage ( d and c ) under intravenous anesthesia was performed for incomplete abortion . after d and c , her obstetrician prescribed ampicillin ( 750 mg / day ) , however , she took them only one day . three days later , she developed posterior cervical pain , which worsened and caused difficulty in flexing and extending the neck . ten days after the operation , she was admitted to the emergency department of another hospital . physical examination revealed body temperature of 39.3c ;

therefore , urgent orthopedic surgery was performed . after the anterior discectomy of c5 and c6 , pus was drained . since pus culture revealed b. fragilis group , oral metronidazole ( 1 g / day ) the weakness in her limb muscles were improved ( mrc grade 4 ) , and the numbness gradually resolved after the operation . in most causes of sea , at least one predisposing factor such as intravenous drug use , diabetes mellitus , invasive spinal procedures , penetrating spinal trauma , and immunosuppressive therapy is present ; however , d and c for abortion as one of the risk factors for sea has not reported previously . bacteremia occurs in approximately 5% of the patients who undergo d and c , and progresses to intrauterinal abscess in most cases . however , some forms of extrauterinal abscess after d and c , such as anaerobic breast abscess , septic arthritis and thigh abscess caused by -haemolytic streptococci , psoas abscess caused by staphylococcus aureus and bacterial sacroliliitis and gluteal abscess caused by streptococcus agalactiae have been rarely reported . these manifestations were not associated with any underlying diseases , and most of them eventually required surgical drainage . although the role of antimicrobial prophylaxis in postprocedural pelvic inflammatory disease prevention has been extensively discussed , there is no evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis . a large variety of causative agents for sea have been indentified ; however , two - thirds of the causes of pyogenic bacteremia were caused by staphylococcus aureus , and only 2% of the cases were caused by anaerobic bacteria . the b. fragilis group , which includes organisms such as b. fragilis , b. ovatus , b. thetaiotaomicron , b. uniformis , and b. vulgatus , contains anerobic bacteria . these bacteria can produce a wide variety of infections with a tendency to form abscesses . female genital tract infections caused by these bacteria include bacterial vaginosis , endometritis , and postsurgical obstetric and gynecologic infections . on the other hand , except for extragenital procedures involving d and c , endodonic procedure and vertebroplasy might be one of the risk factors of anerobic spondylodiscitis , which were resulted from hematogenous spreading from a distant primary site of infection . in our case , d and c for incomplete abortion might have caused transient bacteremia resulted in spondylodiscitis and hematogenous sea . micro - organism in vagina might reach cervical discs through hematogenous spreading from pelvic venous plexus ( batson 's plexus ) and cause spondylodiscitis and sea in early days . the patient did not have any risk factors other than the d and c procedure . early imaging could play a crucial role in the treatment of sea , and a careful history taking and physical examination could allow detection of the infectious source . although the use of prophylactic antibiotics in intrauterinal procedures and in cases of incomplete abortion is controversial at present , further clinical trials to assess the necessity of antibiotic prophylaxis after d and c for abortion is necessary should be considered .","spinal epidural abscess ( sea ) is a rare infection complicated in patients who have some risk factors such as injection - drug use , diabetes mellitus , and several illnesses .

"an incisional biopsy from mandibular region of a 45-year - old female patient was submitted to our department of oral pathology and microbiology with the history of pain and swelling in the right lower back teeth region for past 2 months . the clinical details given to us were , swelling in the right lower cheek region extraorally . intraorally the swelling was extending from right canine to retromolar area and 45 and 46 were mobile . the hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathological stain showed numerous follicular structures within the connective tissue . the follicles were lined by tall columnar ameloblast like cells with reverse polarity and surrounding stellate reticulum like cells . both peripheral tall columnar cells and central stellate reticulum like cells showed dense granularity . hematoxylin and eosin stained section showing ameloblastic follicles with granular cells ( h and e , 10 ) following the histopathological diagnosis hemimandibulectomy was done . the hemimandibulectomy specimen showed thinned out buccal cortical plate and perforation of the lingual article plate at multiple locations . anterior and posterior surgical margins were sectioned , and histopathological examination was done after decalcification . all the sections from the excised specimen showed granular cell ameloblastoma while the anterior and posterior surgical margin did not show any residual tumor . patient is currently on regular follow - up for the past 22 months and no sign of recurrence . ameloblastoma sometimes exhibits granular transformation of cytoplasm occurring in central stellate reticulum like cells , and this change often extends to peripheral columnar or cuboidal cells . hematoxylin and eosin staining and periodic acid schiff staining showed granular neoplastic cells residing within the tumor follicles . light microscopic study of granular cell ameloblastomas shows numerous neoplastic epithelial islands in a scant , mature fibrous stroma . the most striking features of this tumor were that the center of the island had large eosinophilic granular cells , surrounded by tall columnar cells resembling the inner enamel epithelium of the enamel organ . their cytoplasmic granules ranged from fine to coarse and in some cells pink , homogenous rounded masses which resembled inclusion bodies larger than coarse granules . the peripheral cells lining the islands were tall columnar or cuboidal with nuclei displaced opposite to the base of the cell and many peripheral cells were granular . the granular cells are a transitional or matured phase in the life cycle of ameloblasts , starting with normal stellate reticulum like cells leading to the production of granules and finally resulting in degeneration and the formation of cystic areas . ultrastructurally , in the granular cell ameloblastoma the peripheral cells of the tumor islands were separated from surrounding stroma by continuous basement membrane . the most striking cytoplasmic feature is the presence of numerous granules ( pleomorphic osmiophilic granules ) . the granules are round or oval , composed of homogenous amorphous osmiophilic material of different density . the granules were known to be lysosomes , which might play a role of autophagy and of remodeling the cytoplasm , as opposed to the aging or degenerating function . the cytoplasmic granularity in granular cell ameloblastomas might be caused by increased apoptotic cell death of neoplastic cells and associated phagocytosis by neighboring neoplastic cells . lysosomal aggregation within cytoplasm is caused by dysfunction of either a lysosomal enzyme or lysosome associated protein involved in activation or targeting of the enzyme or lysosomal biogenesis . the granular cell ameloblastoma is a locally aggressive tumor with a high frequency of recurrence and potential to metastasize . it shows a slightly higher rate of recurrence of about 33.3% when compared with other common variants . however , very high recurrence rates were reported by hartman et al . ( 73% ) . the presence of tumor cells within the bone beyond the clinical and radiological margins are thought to be responsible for the recurrence when the tumors are treated with enucleation or curettage . the malignant transformation is rare , but the cases with metastasizing granular cell ameloblastoma lymph nodes , lungs and cervical vertebrae have been reported . however , further studies with long - term follow - up are necessary for the better understanding of the tumor 's diagnosis , prognosis and treatment .","granular cell ameloblastoma is a slow growing odontogenic ectodermal tumor .

"autophagy , literally meaning self ( auto ) eating ( phagy ) , is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated catabolic process that leads to the degradation of cellular components using lysosomal / vacuolar degradation machinery of the same cell . depending on the mechanism of transport to lysososome / vacuole , at least three forms of autophagy have been described :  macroautophagy  is characterized by the engulfment of long - lived proteins and organelles in de novo formed double-/multimembrane vesicles called autophagosomes or autophagic vesicles . these vesicles subsequently deliver their cargo to the lysosome or vacuole for degradation . in another form of autophagy , called lysosome / vacuole directly engulfs cytosolic components through an invagination of its membrane [ 1 , 2 ] . a third common form of autophagy cma is a very selective process during which proteins with a kferq consensus peptide sequence are recognized by a chaperone / cochaperone complex and delivered to the lytic compartment in an unfolded state [ 3 , 4 ] . macroautophagy (  autophagy  hereafter ) occurs at basal levels in growing cells , allowing them to recycle long - lived proteins and organelles . the cargo is degraded into its building blocks ( i.e. , proteins to amino acids ) , helping the cell to economize its resources , eliminate old / damaged organelles , and survive nutrient and other types of stress . for example , in plants under conditions causing cellular and organismal stress such as starvation , drought , and other abiotic stress , autophagy is upregulated [ 58 ] . autophagy is also involved in physiological phenomena including plant development , senescence , and immune response [ 911 ] . in some cases , autophagy can function as a nonapoptotic and alternative programmed cell death mechanism , and its role in plant cell death was explored [ 1215 ] . as a consequence of its involvement in several important physiological and pathological phenomena , autophagy became one of the fastest expanding fields of molecular biology in recent years . in this review , we will briefly summarize the mechanisms of autophagy in general and particularly plant autophagy , list commonly used techniques to detect and quantify autophagy , and finally discuss their utility in plant autophagy detection . the readers may find an in - depth discussion of the mechanistic aspects of autophagy in recently published reviews [ 5 , 9 , 16 ] . so far , nearly 30 autophagy - related genes ( depicted by the acronym atg ) were identified using yeast mutants . data obtained from these studies underline the fact that the basic machinery of autophagy is preserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes . autophagy proceeds through five distinct phases : namely , induction , nucleation , vesicle expansion and completion , autophagosome / lysosome fusion , and cargo degradation [ 9 , 18 ] ( figure 1(a ) ) . this is the phase where upstream signaling mechanisms leading to autophagy activation are turned on . many of these pathways are integrated by the  target of rapamycin ( tor )  protein [ 1921 ] . tor is a serine / threonine kinase regulated in response to variation in amino acids , atp , and growth factors . tor pathway and its effect on autophagy were preserved in plants . yet , structural differences exist between tor proteins in plants and other eukaryotes , therefore , rapamycin , a widely used specific inhibitor of tor , can not be used to study autophagy in plants [ 23 , 24 ] . the first involves activation of transcription factors called gln13 ( nitrogen regulatory protein ) and gcn4 ( general control nondepressible ) , leading to transcriptional upregulation of some of the atg genes ( e.g. , atg1 and atg13 ) [ 25 , 26 ] . second mechanism is related to the modification by tor of an autophagy protein complex containing atg1 and atg13 . active tor induces hyperphosphorylation of atg13 inhibiting its association with atg1 ( atatg1 in a. thaliana and ulk1 ( unc-51-like kinase1 ) in mammals ) , a serine / threonine kinase required for autophagy . tor inactivation leads to rapid dephosphorylation of atg13 and an increase in the affinity of this protein for atg1 . recent evidences indicate that atg1 - 13 complex regulates recycling of atg proteins such as atg9 and atg23 functioning at the autophagy organization site called pas ( for the preautophagosomal structure ) . while the origin of the lipid donor membranes in autophagy is still obscure , endoplasmic reticulum , golgi , and a so far undetermined organelle called  the phagophore  were suggested as lipid providers to autophagosomes . whatever is the origin , autophagosomal membranes , pas is a prominent structure next to the vacuole , but in higher eukaryotes , several sites are involved . nucleation of autophagosomes is initiated by a protein complex including vps34 , a class iii phosphatidylinositol 3-oh kinase ( pi3k ) , and atg6/vps30 ( beclin1 in mammals ) . together with other regulatory proteins such as uvrag ( uv radiation resistance associated gene ) , bif-1 , and ambra , atg6-containing complex plays a role in the regulation of vps34 activity . pi3p produced by vps34 serves as a landing pad on pas for proteins involved in autophagosome formation such as atg18 and atg2 [ 16 , 32 , 33 ] . two ubiquitination - like conjugation systems play a role in autophagosome biogenesis . in the first reaction , atg12 is conjugated to atg5 in a covalent manner . the conjugation reaction starts with the activation of atg12 by an ubiquitin - activating enzyme ( e1)-like protein atg7 . atg12 is then transferred to atg10 , an ubiquitin - conjugating - like enzyme ( e2)-like protein [ 35 , 36 ] . finally , atg12 is covalently conjugated to atg5 . the conjugation allows the formation and stabilization of a larger complex containing atg12 , atg5 , and atg16 . this protein complex is necessary for the second ubiquitination - like reaction to occur and to allow autophagosome membrane elongation . complex localizes to the outer membrane of the forming autophagosome , and , dissociates from it as soon as the vesicle is completed , underlining the fact that its role is regulatory rather than structural . the second ubiquitination - like reaction involves atg8 protein ( microtubule - associated protein light chain-3 or shortly lc3 in mammals ) . while atg7 is common to both conjugation reactions , e2-like protein atg3 is specific for atg8 conjugation to a lipid molecule ( phosphatidylethanolamine , pe ) . prior to conjugation , atg8 has to be cleaved at its carboxy - terminus by atg4 , allowing the access of the lipid molecule to a glycine residue on atg8 . lipidation reaction is reversible since atg4 can also cleave the conjugated lipid , enabling recycling of atg8 . recent data provide evidence that together with atg3 , atg12/5 complex is directly responsible for   atg8-pe conjugation . the yeast atg8 has several orthologues and isoforms in plants [ 4143 ] . in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana , at least 9 atg8 proteins were described . a vps complex and rab gtpases proteins are involved in the organization of the fusion site . then , snares proteins ( snap as soluble nsf attachment protein receptor )   form a complex which serves as a bridge between the two organelles [ 46 , 47 ] . in the lumen of lysosome / vacuole , lipases such as atg15 first degrade the remaining autophagic membrane and the cargo is then catabolized by lysosomal lytic enzymes . following the degradation of the vesicle , specialized lysosome membrane proteins play a role in this process including lysosomal - associated membrane proteins lamp-1 and lamp-2 . both microautophagy and macroautophagy are functional in plants . mechanisms of these pathways are similar to those described in other model organisms .   in plant cargo - containing vesicle pinches off to be released inside the vacuole and degraded within the lumen . microautophagy was involved in accumulation of storage proteins , lipids , and degradation of starch granules in developing plants [ 49 , 50 ] . as in other organisms , the macroautophagy ( hereafter  autophagy  ) in plants is a process that starts with the formation of cup - shaped membranes in the cytoplasm . they may fuse with the tonoplast and be directly delivered to the lumen of the vacuole as seen in arabidopsis . alternatively , autophagosomes may first transform into lysosome - like acidic and lytic structures and , fusion with the central vacuole may occur as a secondary event ( figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) ) [ 51 , 52 ] . in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana , some exist as a single copy ( i.e. , atg3 and atg5 ) and others as multiple copies ( i.e. , atg1 and atg8 ) . functional domains of these arabidopsis proteins were well conserved during evolution , indicating preservation of basic autophagy mechanisms in plants . indeed , complementation tests in atg mutant yeast strains using some of the plant atg proteins confirmed the preservation of their function . moreover , gene targeting studies in whole plants demonstrated that plant genes of all tested autophagy proteins ( i.e. , for atg7 , atg9 and atg5-atg12 ) were necessary for autophagosome formation following various types of stress [ 44 , 53 , 55 ] . furthermore , some atg genes were upregulated under stress conditions stimulating autophagy [ 7 , 5661 ] . a list of atg genes identified in arabidopsis and the phenotypes caused by their modification are depicted in table 1 . incubation of root tips with vacuolar enzyme inhibitors led to the accumulation of autophagic vesicles as autolysosome - like structures and in the vacuole . when cysteine protease inhibitor , e64d , was used to inhibit autophagy , autophagic vesicles accumulated inside vacuoles in arabidopsis cells . similarly , growth of tobacco cells in the presence of e64d led to the accumulation of autolysosome - like structures outside the vacuole . autophagy - specific inhibitor 3-ma blocked the accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes , demonstrating that autophagy is responsible for vesicle accumulation [ 52 , 62 ] . expression of a gfp fusion construct of atg8f ( an autophagy marker in arabidopsis ) resulted in the accumulation of this marker protein in the vacuole lumen . atg8f accumulation was also detected in the presence of concanamycin a ( a vacuolar h(+)-atpase inhibitor blocking vacuolar degradation ) . the role of constitutive autophagy in the degradation of damaged or oxidized molecules was confirmed using mutants of atatg18a . these mutants produced greater amounts of oxidized proteins and lipids in comparison to wild - type plants . increased amount of oxidized protein and lipid generation in atg18a - silenced plants underlined importance of autophagy for the degradation of oxidized molecules in plant cells [ 8 , 63 ] . therefore , as in other organisms , plant basal autophagy seems to function to eliminate damaged organelles ( e.g. , chloroplast , a source of reactive oxygen species in plants ) and to clear damaged / abnormal proteins that accumulate in the cytoplasm . the role of autophagy for plant development was studied using several autophagy gene mutants . under nutrient - rich conditions , autophagy - defective plants achieve normal embryonic development , germination , shoot and root growth , flower development , and seed generation [ 44 , 53 , 54 ] . when these plants are grown under carbon- or nitrogen - deficient conditions , accelerated bolting , increased chlorosis , dark - induced senescence , and a decrease in seed yield were observed . therefore , autophagy seems to be a major mechanism of nutrient mobilization under starvation conditions in plants . autophagy plays a role during vacuole biogenesis as well . in a recent study , yano et al .   proposed that formation of vacuoles from tobacco by-2 protoplasts involved an autophagy - like process . however , this process could not be inhibited by classical autophagy inhibitors such as 3-ma and wortmannin , suggesting that autophagy during vacuole formation differs from constitutive autophagy taking place under normal conditions or autophagy induced by stress . when organisms including plants are exposed to adverse environmental conditions , they develop responses to cope with stress and to survive . stress conditions inducing autophagy include sucrose , nitrogen , and carbon starvation , as well as oxidative stress and pathogen infection [ 8 , 62 , 66 , 67 ] . for example , sucrose starvation has been reported to induce autophagy in rice , sycamore , and tobacco - cultured cells , and carbon starvation induced autophagy in maize plants . furthermore , autophagy participates in the formation of protein storage vacuoles in seeds and cereal grains [ 71 , 72 ] , prolamin internalization to vacuole in wheat , biogenesis of vegetative vacuoles in mature meristematic cells [ 74 , 75 ] , and degradation of proteins in protein storage vacuoles in mung bean [ 49 , 76 ] . since plants have a rigid cell wall and they lack typical caspase proteases , apoptosis is not the mechanism utilized by plants to degrade cellular components before cell death . during programmed cell death ( pcd ) in plants , vacuole and cell size increase , organelles are taken up by vacuole and subsequently degraded , and finally vacuole lyses resulting in cell death . these events overlap with the major characteristics of autophagy in plants [ 15 , 77 ] . in the light of these observations , the role of autophagy in plant programmed cell death needs to be further investigated . to avoid spread of infection , plants developed an innate immune response , called the hypersensitive response programmed cell death ( hr - pcd ) . the innate immunity is achieved through limitation of the infection with the death of cells surrounding the infected area . studies using autophagy gene mutant plants showed that an autophagy defect is associated with a failure to contain cell death at the infection site , leading to its spread into uninfected tissue [ 7981 ] . therefore , paradoxically , autophagy also plays a role in limiting cell death initiated during plant innate immune responses . indeed , as seen in plants , autophagy is involved both in cell survival and cell death in various other organisms . various techniques and tools were used to monitor and evaluate autophagy . while transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) analysis remains  the golden standard ,  with the recent advances in the field , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) is one of the earliest tools used to characterize autophagy , and it is still one of the most reliable methods to monitor autophagy in cells and tissues . yet , interpretation of the tem data requires special expertise and there are several criteria to describe autophagosomes and autolysosomes with precision . the hallmark of autophagosomes is their double or multimembrane structures containing electron dense material with a density similar to that of the cytoplasm . presence in autophagosomes of organelles such as mitochondria , chloroplasts , and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) strengthens the conclusion ( figure 2(b ) ) . autolysosomes contain darker , degenerated , or degraded material and some of them are reminiscent of lysosomes / vacuole . degenerated mitochondria , folds of er , or nuclear membrane may be mistaken for autophagosomes [ 8385 ] . sometimes the typical double membrane structure of autophagosomes may be disrupted ( e.g. , following infection with some pathogens ) . combination of electron microscopy with immunogold - labelling of autophagosome - specific markers such as atg8/lc3 may allow a more objective and reliable interpretation depending on the experimental needs . transmission electron microscopy was successfully used to detect autophagy in plants [ 61 , 79 ] . proteins that are involved in the autophagy process or that are degraded specifically through autophagy have been used to monitor autophagic activity . plants knock - out and transgenic for these markers are useful tools to study autophagy - related phenotypes under different experimental conditions ( see table 1 ) . molecular techniques , such as atg8/lc3 dot formation , were successfully used for high - throughput screens of autophagy in various systems . atg8/lc3 is covalently conjugated to a lipid molecule as a result of an ubiquitination - like reaction and , its lipidation is required for autophagic membrane elongation ( see section 2.3 ) . in plants , several isoforms of atg8/lc3 seem to be functional during autophagy mechanisms . during autophagy , atg8/lc3 lipidation and recruitment to autophagic membranes changes its localization from diffuse cytosolic to punctuate ( figure 2 ) [ 51 , 54 , 89 , 90 ] . moreover , in sds - page protein gels , the molecular weight of atg8/lc3 changes from 18kda ( free cytosolic form , free atg8 , or lc3-i ) to 16kda ( lipidated form , atg8-pe ( or lc3-ii ) ) [ 41 , 54 , 57 ] . soon after the discovery of its autophagy - related lipidation , atg8/lc3 had become one of the main tools to monitor autophagy . the localization change of an atg8/lc3-fluorescent protein fusion construct ( such as gfp - atg8/lc3 ) is commonly used to detect autophagy in cells ( figure 2(a ) ) and in whole organisms including transgenic arabidopsis and tobacco plants [ 38 , 51 , 54 , 55 , 57 ] . when working with isolated cells , quantification of gfp - atg8/lc3 signal using facscan / flow cytometer may be used as an autophagy evaluation tool . in this system , this method is a good quantitative tool to monitor activity in living cells by facscan / flow cytometer [ 9294 ] , especially using cells derived from atg8 transgenic plants . free atg8 ( or lc3-i ) to atg8-pe ( or lc3-ii ) ratio differ among tissues , depending on stimuli and antibodies that are used , therefore , reliable controls must be added . to avoid misinterpretations due to kinetics of autophagy , it is highly advised to check atg8/lc3 lipidation at several time points after signal application rather than using only one point in time . the use of vacuolar / lysosomal degradation inhibitors will help to confirm that accumulation of the lipidated form is indeed due to the canonical autophagy pathway . it has been reported that high level gfp - atg8/lc3 expression may also lead to dot formation even in nonautophagic cells   and in autophagy mutants . furthermore , atg8/lc3 was found to associate with protein aggregates marked with p62/sqstm1 ( see section 4.2.7 ) in an autophagy - independent manner . importantly , atg8/lc3 lipidation reflects an early stage in autophagosome formation and it can not be interpreted as autophagic activity per se [ 99 , 100 ] . hence , this method should not be used as the only technique to monitor autophagy and it has to be complemented with other autophagy detection techniques including tem analysis . , atg6 regulates vps34 class iii phosphoinositide-3 kinase ( pi3k ) complex producing pi3p that is involved in autophagic vesicle nucleation . similar to atg8/lc3 , intracellular localization change of a fluorescent protein fusion of atg6 ( and leading to its colocalization with pi3p ) was observed upon autophagy induction [ 101 , 102 ] . pi3p may be labelled in cells using a pi3p - binding peptide , fyve fused to gfp . quantification of the accumulation of gfp - fyve - labelled dots may also be used as a tool to quantify autophagy activation upon starvation in mammalian cells ( yamaner y. and gozuacik d. unpublished data ) . adaptations to the plant system may be possible since orthologues of atg6 and vps34 are present in plants including arabidopsis . atg5 as well as atg16 was used as a selective marker to recognize autophagosome organization centers ( pas ) . since atg5 dissociates after vesicle completion the signal could be detected as fluorescent dots under microscope [ 38 , 97 ] . like atg5 , atg16l transiently associates with the surface of autophagosomes during their formation and forms punctate structures . therefore , as atg8/lc3 , atg5 and atg16l , coupled with a fluorophore or detected by immunofluorescence using specific antibodies , can be used to monitor autophagosome formation . as homologues of atg5 and atg16 exist in plants ( e.g. , arabidopsis , z. mays ) this technique might be useful in plants studies as well . a mammalian orthologue of the yeast atg18 , wipi-1 , was proposed as a marker for autophagy as well . wipi-1 is a wd ( tryptophan and aspartic acid ) repeat protein   and as such , it may interact with pi3p and accumulate in dot - like structures ( upon autophagy induction by amino acid starvation other stimuli ) . wipi-1 dots were shown to colocalize with atg8/lc3 [ 107 , 109 ] in human cells lines . whether plant atg18 protein might be used as an autophagy marker has to be tested as homologues are found in plants such as arabidopsis . recently , monitoring atg8/lc3 cleavage by atg4 was proposed as a technique to detect autophagy . the assay is based on the cleavage by atg4 of a luciferase protein fused to atg8/lc3 which , itself , is fixed on actin cytoskeleton . in this system , actin - associated luciferase has a secretion signal and , upon cleavage of atg8/lc3 by atg4 , it is released from the cell . homologues of atg4 are present in plants including arabidopsis and rice ; therefore , this technique could be adapted to monitor atg4 protease activity in plants . its activity correlated with autophagy induction [ 22 , 27 , 111113 ] . in s. cerevisiae , atg1 autophosphorylation is dramatically reduced upon starvation leading to autophagy .   in mammals , the function of atg1 orthologues ulk1 and ulk2 seems to be controlled by autophosphorylation as well [ 113 , 114 ] . hence , atg1 kinase activity and phosphorylation status could be used as a new test of the autophagic activity in cells , tissues , and extracts . in arabidopsis thaliana genome , orthologues of the yeast genes coding for atg1 kinase and atg13 have been identified [ 53 , 115 ] . therefore , measuring atg1 activity could serve as a tool to monitor autophagy in plants . sequestosome 1 ( sqstm1 ) , also named ubiquitin - binding protein p62 ( shortly p62 ) , is a stress - induced adaptor / marker protein that is a common component of protein aggregates . p62/atg8 interaction triggered degradation of protein aggregates by autophagy during which p62 itself was also degraded [ 118 , 119 ] . this observation led to the use of p62 degradation as a molecular tool to detect autophagic activity [ 119121 ] . as lc3 lipidation appears prior to p62 degradation , existence of a lag phase should be considered during the design of the experiments . of note , it is still not known whether p62 is a general marker for autophagy and caution should be taken when using this technique with new autophagy - inducing stimuli . weakly basic amines selectively accumulate in cellular compartments with low internal ph and can be used to visualize acidic compartments such as lysosomes / vacuoles . labelling of acidic compartments by lysotracker is likely due to its protonation and retention in the membranes of these organelles . lytic compartment labelling methods such as lysotracker staining must be used in combination with more specific markers of autophagy in order to discriminate autophagic activity from other events increasing lysosome / vacuole activity . lysotracker staining method has been used to monitor autophagy in various organisms including arabidopsis , tobacco , and barley [ 79 , 80 , 122 ] . ao accumulates in acidic compartments , such as lysosomes and vacuole , and becomes protonated and sequestered in their lumen . in acridine orange - stained cells , cytoplasm and nucleolus therefore , quantification of the red fluorescence reflects the degree of acidity and the volume of the cellular acidic compartments . comparison of the ratio of green / red fluorescence in cells , using fluorescent microscopy or flow cytometry , enables quantification of the extent of autophagic degradation [ 123 , 124 ] . so far , to our knowledge , no study used ao as a plant autophagy marker . the autofluorescent substance monodansylcadaverine is commonly used to detect autophagy in plants and in other organisms [ 67 , 125127 ] . mdc is a weak base that is capable   of crossing biological membranes and concentrating in acidic compartments . although mdc was originally proposed to label autophagosomes and autolysosomes , recent studies on mammalian autophagy brought out that it is not an autophagy - specific marker . these publications revealed that mdc - positive structures colocalized only partially with autophagosome markers in cells . furthermore , in autophagy - defective atg5 knockout cells , mdc - positive dots were still observed . the figures labelled by mdc seem to be endosomes , lysosomes , and lamellar bodies . therefore , mdc associates with acidic and lipid - rich compartments and it does not discriminate between autophagosomes / autolysosomes and the aforementioned vesicular organelles . since autophagy is involved in the degradation of long - lived proteins , determination of their turnover appears to be an efficient method to monitor autophagy levels in cells . in the commonly used technique , following metabolic labelling , degradation of all long - lived proteins a radioactively labelled amino acid such as valine or leucine can be used to label newly synthesized proteins . then cells are incubated with cold amino acids to allow short - lived proteins to be degraded . finally , release of labelled amino acids resulting from the degradation of long - lived proteins is monitored . one major weakness of this technique is that autophagy is not the only mechanism of long - lived proteins degradation . autophagic and nonautophagic degradation of long - lived proteins should be distinguished by the use of autophagy inhibitors such as 3-mehyladenine ( 3-ma ) . an alternative nonradioactive method uses chromatography to monitor the amount of released unlabeled amino acids . usage of metabolic labelling in plants was hindered by high compartmentalization of protein substrates and by the fact that metabolite pools in plant cells are generally highly dynamic . recently developed techniques allowing metabolic labeling of whole plants and plant cell cultures may overcome these difficulties and allow quantification of autophagy by long - lived protein degradation in plants [ 135137 ] . radio - labelled sucrose or raffinose , delivered to cytosol through electropermeabilization , is sequestered in autophagic vesicles together with engulfed cytosolic fragments . accumulation of radioactivity in autophagic membrane fractions was used to measure autophagic activity [ 138 , 139 ] . furthermore , injection of the labelled molecule can disturb cellular homeostasis , therefore , precautions and extracontrols including determination of the metabolic equilibrium of the cell prior to the measurement are required . sugar sequestration technique might be useful in plant cell cultures studies and it needs to be tested . an assay to monitor autophagy in plants carbon starvation - activated degradation of membrane lipids led to the accumulation of phosphorylcholine in the cytoplasm . phosphorylcholine accumulation correlated well with autophagy - induction and its quantification by 31p - nmr spectroscopy was proposed as a novel way of autophagy detection in plant cells . one of the yeast techniques developed to monitor autophagy makes use of an n - terminal truncated mutant of the yeast alkaline phosphatase pho8 . in contrast to the er - localized wild - type enzyme , the mutant form of pho8 lacking the n - terminal signal sequence ( pho860 ) , is delivered to the vacuole by way of autophagy . following entry to the vacuole , pho860 is cleaved at its c - terminus to produce the active alkaline phosphatase . measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and/or protein immunoblotting to check the shift between precursor and mature enzyme allows the detection of autophagic activity in yeast cells . nonselective degradation of marker proteins ( especially those with an enzymatic activity ) might also be used in plants as autophagy detection methods . although autophagy is generally considered as a nonselective phenomenon , some proteins appear to be selectively degraded by autophagy . a gfp or dsred construct , targeted to the chloroplast , and a gfp fusion of rubisco were transported to the vacuole through autophagy [ 90 , 142 ] . rubisco is allocated most of the plant nitrogen and functions in carbon - fixation in chloroplasts . it is released from the chloroplasts in structures called rubisco - containing bodies ( rcbs ) in order to provide nitrogen from the leaves to others organs . rcb seem to overlap with autophagic vesicles , indicating that rubisco is engulfed in autophagosomes and eventually delivered to the vacuole . the process was dependent on atg genes underlining the autophagic character of the transport . therefore , targeted gfp - dsred constructs or gfp - rubisco may be used as tools to study selective autophagy in plants . another study proposed measurement of neomycin phosphotransferase ii accumulation by flow cytometry as an autophagy detection method [ 144 , 145 ] . whether the plant orthologue betaine homocysteine methyltransferase shares the same faith and whether neomycin phosphotransferase follows the same path in plants has to be determined . since autophagy is a general process for the quality control of organelles , mitochondria are common targets of autophagic degradation . the term mitophagy was coined to describe the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy . in yeast , a technique of mitophagy detection was recently developed . this method is based on the use of a gfp - tagged mitochondrial protein and monitorization of the vacuolar release of green fluorescent protein after the degradation of chimera . similarly , during autophagy activated by sucrose starvation in plants , a gradual decrease in the number of mitochondria per cell was observed , indicating that techniques based on mitochondrial degradation may be developed to study autophagy in plants . due to its role in fundamental biological phenomena in various organisms including humans and plants , interest in autophagy field is growing exponentially . accumulation of the knowledge on autophagy molecular mechanisms stimulated the discovery of more efficient and reliable molecular tools to study autophagy . despite the fact that some of these methods and tools seem to be more suitable for use in specific model organisms plant autophagy studies already benefit from the adaptation of various general autophagy detection techniques used in other model organisms , such as atg8/lc3 localization tests . main disadvantages or difficulties of available tools to study autophagy . a better understanding of the biological phenomena involving autophagy in plants and its molecular mechanisms and targets will lead to the development of novel and more precise techniques that will allow the measurement of autophagy in plants with increasing precision and will further accelerate studies in this field .","autophagy ( or self eating ) , a cellular recycling mechanism , became the center of interest and subject of intensive research in recent years . 
 development of new molecular techniques allowed the study of this biological phenomenon in various model organisms ranging from yeast to plants and mammals . 
 accumulating data provide evidence that autophagy is involved in a spectrum of biological mechanisms including plant growth , development , response to stress , and defense against pathogens . in this review , 
 we briefly summarize general and plant - related autophagy studies , and explain techniques commonly used to study autophagy . 
 we also try to extrapolate how autophagy techniques used in other organisms may be adapted to plant studies .",137
"embryos generated through assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) are deemed surplus when , for some reason , they are not used for reproductive purposes ( svendsen and koch 2008 ; haimes and taylor 2011 ) ; instead , they are then disposed of or , where this is allowed by a country s art regulation , may be donated for a variety of research purposes . thus , the generation and subsequent fate of embryos that are designated surplus are determined as much by legislation as by embryo biology or technological constraints . for example , legislatures differ in whether cryopreservation of embryos is permitted , meaning that in some countries any ivf embryos not immediately transferred for pregnancy are surplus , while in others they may be frozen for later transfer . in some countries , the law considers surplus embryos as the primary source of material for human embryonic stem cell ( hesc ) research , while in others this use of embryos is expressly forbidden . although hesc research has been subjected to exhaustive ethical scrutiny , the lack of consensus on the ontological or ethical status of surplus embryos means that the uses to which they may then be put remain contested ( deckers 2007 ; guenin 2008 ; moller 2009 ) . even if using human embryos for stem cell research is deemed permissible , ethical issues continue to emerge as new social practices and roles develop around the act of embryo donation . the relative novelty of these practices and roles , complicated by the pace of change in technical possibility and regulation , mean that there is still uncertainty about how to conceptualise embryo donation , not just in terms of systematic ethics but as a sociomoral practice in everyday social life and morality ( banks , scully , and shakespeare 2006 ) . from a sociological perspective , and also to understand more generally how everyday morality deals with unprecedented ethical dilemmas , it is important to examine which conceptualisations emerge as salient and how they are stabilised and used . for example , one way of thinking about the donation of embryos to research is as a bodily gift relationship , one of the many established by modern biomedicine such as the donation of eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes , organs or tissues for transplantation , blood for transfusion , and other biological tissues for research . drawing analogies to existing practices in this way has proved helpful in other instances of bioethical novelty ( hofmann , solbakk , and holm 2006 ) . however , analogies can equally well be misleading , if there are morally relevant but unacknowledged differences between situations . the contexts in which different organs and tissues are donated vary significantly , and these differences influence the sociomoral understanding of donation in each case and make them noncomparable in ethical terms . reproductive tissue , for example , is generally distinguished from other types of donated tissue because eggs , sperm , and embryos have the potential to give rise to new individuals , not just to prolong the lives of existing individuals , or to be used for research . because embryos are generally considered to have a different moral status from other tissues , the use of surplus embryos in research raises moral unease about the instrumentalization of human life that is not raised in quite the same way by the donation of either ova or sperm . it is therefore unclear whether an embryo can meaningfully be treated as a  gift  (  donation  ) without blurring the morally relevant differences between embryos and other tissues . similarly ,  hesc research ,  to which the embryo may be given , is a domain of biomedical practices and not an entity . as such , hesc research is not a subject with which a gift relationship can be established ( unlike , for instance , an organ recipient ) . understanding the social and ethical meanings that are emerging for the practices associated with embryo donation calls for a detailed empirical examination of people s reasoning behind donation decisions . however , most empirical studies of embryo donation have not focused on people s donation rationales in depth ( with some exceptions ; for example , haimes et al . 2008 ; de lacey 2003 ) . the scarcity of data on donor rationales means there is a corresponding lack of information on contextual and other factors that influence donor decisions and how these can be related to the evaluations of theoretical ethics . the authors of this paper have been involved in a series of linked qualitative studies of practices of embryo donation , first in the united kingdom ( researcher haimes and colleagues ) , then switzerland ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz ) , and in a smaller pilot project in china ( mitzkat , rehmann - sutter , and haimes ) . all three studies shared an interest in understanding reasons for the donation or non - donation of embryos . while the studies in switzerland and china drew upon the original u.k . design , each study was conducted independently , and the details of each project , including interview design , differed in light of the varying regulatory , clinical , and cultural contexts . however , by looking across the three data sets , we hope to gain cross - cultural insights into donation and non - donation rationales and the moral understandings on which they are based . the three studies all used open - ended , semi - structured , one - off interviews between the researcher and people who had been in the position of deciding whether to donate their surplus embryos to research . interviews were designed to explore in depth not just the interviewees decision about donation but also the background to that decision , such as their ivf story , their family and other relationships , their relationship with the clinic and its staff , and so on . the interviews were transcribed , coded , and initially analysed to identify the reasons for donation decisions given by participants in each study , using an interpretative approach that all of us have previously found useful for identifying key themes around decision - making and implicit or explicit ethical judgements ( charmaz 2006 ; smith , flowers , and larkin 2009 ) . study ran for more than three years ; after some familiarisation and observation in the collaborating clinic , 44 in - depth interviews were conducted with couples who had been asked to donate their surplus fresh embryos , generated through ongoing ivf treatment , to hesc research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ) . in the united kingdom , it has been possible for some years to donate unused embryos to stem cell and other kinds of research and also to other couples . the swiss study was carried out shortly after a change in the law that permitted fresh or cryopreserved surplus ivf embryos , under strictly defined conditions , to be donated to stem cell research only . in this study , 17 individuals who had variously chosen to donate or not to donate were interviewed ; thus , the decision concerned the fate of cryopreserved embryos some time after the ivf treatment that had produced them ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . the chinese work involved a much smaller three - month pilot study carried out in a large art hospital . it was designed as a pilot to provide a comparison with the u.k . and swiss material and is , therefore , included here despite the low number of participants , but with no attempt to draw general conclusions from it . legislation in china does not allow the donation of embryos to other couples , but consent can be given for a surplus embryo to be used in stem cell research or for it to be discarded . the study included participant observation of the information and consent procedures and qualitative interviews with five ivf patients , three choosing to donate to stem cell research and two refusing ( mitzkat , haimes , and rehmann - sutter 2010 ) . for the purposes of this paper , the authors involved in the studies jointly compared the rationales for donation decisions given by their participants . we also independently reexamined interview transcripts for material relevant to the discussion of gratitude . in the rest of this paper , we first identify and compare the main reasons given by participants in these three studies for their decisions to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to research . we then look in more detail at the implications of our findings for one area of potential ethical concern : the possible role of gratitude in making embryo disposition decisions . in this way , we not only collect empirical data to help understand the emerging moral meaning of a new practice , but also give an example to show how empirical data can be used to question and then refine the conceptual basis of bioethical theory . participants who chose to donate their surplus embryos to research had a background premise that donation is fundamentally permissible because embryos do not have the sort of ontological or moral status that would forbid it . the swiss study discovered people stating this explicitly :  [ embryos ] are not , they are not yet people ; they are nt beings with souls as far as i m concerned ,  as one swiss participant said.1 but this did not mean that the surplus embryos were considered as morally equivalent to any other tissue , and participants in both the swiss and u.k . interviewees stopped themselves midway through sentences referring to the  left over embryos ,  which they clearly felt , on reflection , was an inappropriate phrase . so the embryos did not have the sort of moral status that would have made it wrong to donate them , but neither were they completely disposable . to some of our participants , embryos had a value ; they were a precious resource ( haimes et al . 2008 ) that made simply throwing them out an unjustifiable waste . as another u.k . [ i]t just really seemed a waste , really , not to have them used . it was not always clear , however , quite how interviewees were using this notion of  precious  : whether with reference to economic  bio - value  ( waldby 2000 ; waldby and mitchell 2006 ) or because they had been obtained at intense personal and emotional cost , or because they had high moral value , or possibly a combination of all these aspects . particularly in the swiss study , which involved cryopreserved embryos stored for some time , participants referred to embryos moral status in a nuanced way that was highly sensitive to the developmental stage of the embryo , its physical location ( whether inside or outside the body ) , and its state ( whether cryopreserved or not ) ( see scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . studies seemed less interested in explicitly defining  the  moral status of an abstract embryo than working out what their own particular embryos meant for them at defined points in their own story , and what this meaning then indicated it was morally permissible for them to do with that embryo . across all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research . such research was seen as a valuable endeavour by those like the swiss participant who said ,  i feel that , fundamentally , research has to go on , and i support that . donation of their spare embryos to research was therefore seen as a morally good act , based on a kind of ethical arithmetic in which simple disposal produced zero good from the surplus embryo , while donation had the potential to do good by supporting research . as one u.k . interviewee said ,  it was quite simply that  we ve been helped by the system , we should help the system back.  not because of some sort of martyrdom or heroics or anything like that , just quite simply that without such efforts things do nt progress .  in the u.k . study there was an added imperative to donate surplus embryos to research as there had been a lot of press coverage about the hoped - for curative outcomes of stem cell science : i think the research is very important , like it was in the news a while ago to say that [ the senior clinician ] was successful in stem cell research and that s what you need in order to provide medical assistance in the future , so i m all for it . this observation raises a separate ethical concern about the patients understanding of the information they were given about the research goals . here in the swiss study , the notification from the clinic storing the frozen embryos stated clearly that donation was to stem cell research , yet the majority of donors we interviewed who referred to research did so in terms that were directly relevant to infertility . a lot of preparatory work , research work , went on before medicine was advanced enough that it was possible for us to have children . [ t]his is now maybe a tiny tiny contribution , that we can give back , if we now donate a , er , fertilised egg , perhaps for further research . note that in the chinese pilot study none of the participants spoke in precise terms about the research involved ; however , they described it broadly as one chinese interviewee said she did not really know what the research was about , but trusted the doctors and hoped it would help other infertile women . in switzerland , the donors were former ivf patients donating cryopreserved embryos ; in china , they were current ivf patients donating either fresh or cryopreserved embryos . in neither of these studies were participants asked outright if they thought their donated embryo was being used in infertility research . however , the fact that they used phrases such as  helping others as we have been helped  ( italics added ) indicates a potential misunderstanding . it raises the possibility that if they had been fully aware that the research undertaken with their embryos did not concern infertility , participants might have chosen against donation . the u.k . participants had much clearer ideas about the research to which they were being asked to donate ; they knew that it was not for research on fertility issues . these participants , as in the chinese study , were current patients donating fresh embryos . the differences in comprehension are therefore unlikely to be due to the request context ( former vs. current patients or fresh vs. frozen embryos ) in itself . however , in the u.k . study participants were asked to decide whether or not to donate to a number of specific projects , for each of which the goal and methodology was explained in detail , orally and in writing . it is possible that this level of engagement with the detail of the research underlies the difference . it will be important to clarify this , and to identify best practices for maximising patient comprehension of the research goals , because if ( as our material indicates ) the type of research to which people donate is a relevant factor in their moral evaluation , then the question of whether they fully understand its nature is ethically crucial . as we have seen , some of our participants reasoned that if their embryo was not going to be used for pregnancy , then donating it to a good endeavour ( research ) would be more meaningful than simply discarding it . for example , one interviewee said :  if we ve created life that we , or i , do nt want any more , then maybe it s least sinful , or however you want to put it , if something meaningful happens to it . i feel a little bit guilty sometimes , not very much , but a little bit like  if we can at least give these embryos for a good reason , then it was nt completely in vain .  using similar wording , another said ,  if i ve already gone a bit astray , and in a sense we ve produced life , erm , then at the very least something meaningful should come out of it . our interpretation of their statements is that they felt they had ( inadvertently ) done something wrong in  creating life  but then not using that life as intended in pregnancy , and that donation to a good endeavour would in some way make up for this wrong . ( we want to be quite clear here that we are not arguing that failure to use an ivf embryo in pregnancy actually is a moral wrong , only that some of our participants said that in their case they felt so . ) they did not indicate that they felt their use of ivf in itself had been wrong , but articulated the sense that in ending up with surplus embryos they had done something less than ideal . for these swiss participants , then , their donation decision appears to have been driven in part by what we could call a reparative urge . no indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below . across all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research . such research was seen as a valuable endeavour by those like the swiss participant who said ,  i feel that , fundamentally , research has to go on , and i support that . donation of their spare embryos to research was therefore seen as a morally good act , based on a kind of ethical arithmetic in which simple disposal produced zero good from the surplus embryo , while donation had the potential to do good by supporting research . as one u.k . we ve been helped by the system , we should help the system back.  not because of some sort of martyrdom or heroics or anything like that , just quite simply that without such efforts things do nt progress .  in the u.k . study there was an added imperative to donate surplus embryos to research as there had been a lot of press coverage about the hoped - for curative outcomes of stem cell science : i think the research is very important , like it was in the news a while ago to say that [ the senior clinician ] was successful in stem cell research and that s what you need in order to provide medical assistance in the future , so i m all for it . this observation raises a separate ethical concern about the patients understanding of the information they were given about the research goals . here in the swiss study , the notification from the clinic storing the frozen embryos stated clearly that donation was to stem cell research , yet the majority of donors we interviewed who referred to research did so in terms that were directly relevant to infertility . for instance , one participant said , a lot of preparatory work , research work , went on before medicine was advanced enough that it was possible for us to have children . [ t]his is now maybe a tiny tiny contribution , that we can give back , if we now donate a , er , fertilised egg , perhaps for further research . note that in the chinese pilot study none of the participants spoke in precise terms about the research involved ; however , they described it broadly as  scientific research  for the ivf treatment . one chinese interviewee said she did not really know what the research was about , but trusted the doctors and hoped it would help other infertile women . in switzerland , the donors were former ivf patients donating cryopreserved embryos ; in china , they were current ivf patients donating either fresh or cryopreserved embryos . in neither of these studies were participants asked outright if they thought their donated embryo was being used in infertility research . however , the fact that they used phrases such as  helping others as we have been helped  ( italics added ) indicates a potential misunderstanding . it raises the possibility that if they had been fully aware that the research undertaken with their embryos did not concern infertility , participants might have chosen against donation . participants had much clearer ideas about the research to which they were being asked to donate ; they knew that it was not for research on fertility issues . these participants , as in the chinese study , were current patients donating fresh embryos . the differences in comprehension are therefore unlikely to be due to the request context ( former vs. current patients or fresh vs. frozen embryos ) in itself . however , in the u.k . study participants were asked to decide whether or not to donate to a number of specific projects , for each of which the goal and methodology was explained in detail , orally and in writing . it is possible that this level of engagement with the detail of the research underlies the difference . it will be important to clarify this , and to identify best practices for maximising patient comprehension of the research goals , because if ( as our material indicates ) the type of research to which people donate is a relevant factor in their moral evaluation , then the question of whether they fully understand its nature is ethically crucial . as we have seen , some of our participants reasoned that if their embryo was not going to be used for pregnancy , then donating it to a good endeavour ( research ) would be more meaningful than simply discarding it . for example , one interviewee said :  if we ve created life that we , or i , do nt want any more , then maybe it s least sinful , or however you want to put it , if something meaningful happens to it . i feel a little bit guilty sometimes , not very much , but a little bit like  if we can at least give these embryos for a good reason , then it was nt completely in vain .  using similar wording , another said , if i ve already gone a bit astray , and in a sense we ve produced life , erm , then at the very least something meaningful should come out of it . our interpretation of their statements is that they felt they had ( inadvertently ) done something wrong in  creating life  but then not using that life as intended in pregnancy , and that donation to a good endeavour would in some way make up for this wrong . ( we want to be quite clear here that we are not arguing that failure to use an ivf embryo in pregnancy actually is a moral wrong , only that some of our participants said that in their case they felt so . ) they did not indicate that they felt their use of ivf in itself had been wrong , but articulated the sense that in ending up with surplus embryos they had done something less than ideal . for these swiss participants , then , their donation decision appears to have been driven in part by what we could call a reparative urge . no indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below . approximately half of the swiss participants who were interviewed turned out to have decided against donation and instead have their surplus cryopreserved embryo(s ) destroyed . none of these explicitly used the moral status of the embryo as the fundamental basis for rejecting donation to research . the scientists  would do with their embryo , which was articulated either as disapproval of specific types of research ( e.g. ,  not if it s for cloning  ) or as a more general unwillingness to relinquish responsibility of the embryo to unknown others . in both sets of reasoning , therefore , participants were expressing unease about the loss of control over what would happen to their embryo . the two chinese interviewees who had opted against donation also did so because of reservations about lack of knowledge of exactly what the embryos would be used for , explicitly mentioning the fear that they would be donated to ( i.e. , used to generate pregnancy in ) other women . in addition , two of the swiss participants gave financial reasons , that is , they expressed anger that they would not be compensated for giving up their embryo and that through donation researchers were  getting something for nothing . study , speculation about why some people might refuse to donate raised concerns about what might be done with the embryos and whether a baby would be developed through experimentation ; others wondered if  refusers  were worried that another infertile couple would receive their embryos and have a baby when they , the embryo providers , failed to do so . sample contained only two actual refusers , who objected on the grounds of possible use in animal research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ; hug 2008 ) . these observations provide material for an empirically grounded bioethics of the ivf  stem cell interface ( franklin 2006 ) . in the rest of this paper , we consider a single aspect in detail : the potential  problem  of gratitude influencing informed consent . empirically , the main reasons given by our participants for donation were : ( 1 ) to avoid the waste of a precious resource , ( 2 ) to give something back to research , and ( 3 ) to compensate for a perceived moral wrong . in none of the three countries did our participants indicate that their decision arose out of any sense of gratitude to the physician who had given them ivf treatment . this is an important observation , because the possible impact of gratitude on informed consent in embryo donation has previously been raised by bioethical commentators . it has been suggested that if there is any institutional or procedural link between ivf treatment and hesc research , the potential donors gratitude toward the clinicians who have helped them to conceive may steer them toward opting for donation ( haimes and luce 2006 ; parry 2006 ; mcleod and baylis 2007 ; also discussed in roberts and throsby 2008 ) . the bioethical concern is that parents who receive the  gift of a baby  will feel a sense of gratitude ; feeling grateful might then cause parents to feel that they should respond with a gift in return ; and if a request for donation of surplus embryos is made in that context , potential donors might inadvertently be encouraged to see donation as an appropriate form of return gift . in this way the moral emotion of gratitude could compromise the potential donor s freedom to weigh the pros and cons of the request , which in turn means compromising the capacity to give fully voluntary consent . even where the clinicians and researchers themselves are scrupulous about not using persuasion , gratitude might be persuading potential donors to do something they would not otherwise choose to do . to avoid this possibility , countries that allow embryo donation for research may attempt a strict separation of ivf treatment and the stem cell research domain . ( not all legislatures do this , however : china is one country that does not . ) in the united kingdom , for example , it is accepted good practice that requests for donation of spare embryos should not be made by the physician(s ) who delivered the original ivf treatment . in switzerland , a predominant interpretation of the current law on embryo donation is that a couple undergoing ivf treatment should not be told even of the theoretical possibility that a surplus embryo might be generated unless it actually is ( porz et al . regulators hope to rule out any conflict of interest on the part of the treating physician as well as the possibility of gratitude on the part of the patient . there are several theoretical questions that can be asked about a claim that the  risk  of gratitude affects potential donors decisions . for example , moral psychologists might want to examine the emotional exceptionalism in which gratitude is seen as potentially compromising , while other emotions , or even the absence of emotion , is not . there is also an obvious empirical question which does not seem to have been closely examined : whether potential embryo donors actually do experience a sense of personal gratitude to the physician  or one strong enough to sway their donation decision . however , they do indicate that participants rationales for donation indicate a desire to  give back  in a more complex way . first , our empirical results show the importance of distinguishing between the three moral emotions of gratitude , indebtedness , and solidarity . what we normally mean by gratitude is an emotion primarily associated with gifts or with help that is undeserved . gratitude has been defined as  a feeling of thankful appreciation for favours received  ( guralnik 1971 , 327 ) and is experienced as a positive emotion . ( 2006 ) provide a basis from experimental psychology for distinguishing between indebtedness and gratitude . one important distinction is that  indebtedness is an emotion of exchange , whereas gratitude is not  ( watkins et al . even if a debt of gratitude is felt ,  it does not appear to be analogous to an economic debt indebtedness , however , is , literally , a debt : a  state of obligation to repay another  ( mauss 2001 , 2 ) . a further feature associated with indebtedness but not with gratitude is the inherent imbalance of power , so that a hierarchy is created in which those who are indebted are rendered more vulnerable . the empirical social psychological work of watkins et al . indicates that , in experimental settings at least , a person s feelings of gratitude diminish as the expectation of return ( indebtedness ) increases . the more reciprocity is expected or demanded , importantly for considering the effects of these social emotions on donation decisions , watkins et al . found that the greater the expectation that something will be given back in return , the less motivated the participants were actually to comply with the norm of reciprocity ( watkins et al . these results suggest that if patients were to sense any expectation of return by an individual physician or researcher , it would if anything lessen any gratitude they might have felt . in the ivf context , what people have received ( the thing for which they might feel grateful ) is their baby or pregnancy , or at the very least , treatment . donors who achieve this have not received a gift , but a medical service , which will have been paid for in one way or another . in switzerland , where ivf is not covered by the mandatory health insurance , this will often be direct payment from the patients to the clinic , as it will also often be in china . in the united kingdom , patients who do not already have children commonly receive two  free  cycles of nhs treatment ( paid for through taxes on the population ) , and then they pay for future cycles directly through fees to the clinics . whatever the system of payment , however , the point is that the ivf physician or clinic has already been paid , directly or indirectly , for the treatment which produced the outcome . so in the case of embryo donation , it could be argued that neither gratitude nor indebtedness should be anticipated . gratitude would not be expected , because what patients have received was not a favour or unexpected gift ; and indebtedness would not be expected , because there is no debt if payment has already been made . in our three studies , although we found appreciation and high esteem were expressed for the work of the treating hospital or team , we found no evidence of gratitude being expressed toward an individual physician . this is despite the fact that in both the united kingdom and china mention was made of the well - known head physicians who led each clinic ; the mentions were in appreciation of their reputations , not as a debt of gratitude . participants wanted to do something with the surplus embryo that would be of benefit to research and medical treatment for infertility , but this was not directly associated with the physician who provided it originally . indeed , some of our interviewees were critical of aspects of their own ivf treatment , while still wanting to support the infertility research enterprise overall . in this context , it should be remembered that about half the swiss participants interviewed in fact chose not to donate , primarily out of anxiety about losing control over the fate of their embryos , but also in some cases because it meant researchers were  getting something for nothing . study , a few patients were suspicious that research was being prioritised over treatment and that embryos might have been kept back for the research rather than frozen . although only a small number of participants expressed this view , it has particular relevance here as it indicates clearly the absence of either gratitude or indebtedness : indeed , it suggests that these participants felt that , if anything , donation would mean the researchers were receiving something beyond their entitlement or were indebted to the patients rather than the reverse . social exchanges may entail giving back not to an individual , because the individual may be unknowable or because the benefit may not have come from a single identifiable person , but to  the pattern of social life ( becker 1986)for example , giving back to the institutional biomedical research that had helped the participants . in serial reciprocity , person a receives something from person b , but pays back not to person b but to some other third party ( moody 2008 ) . serial reciprocity accounts for the way that altruistic blood donors often do describe their action in terms of reciprocity , even though they have not received anything from the person to whom their blood eventually goes . what drives serial reciprocity is not gratitude or indebtedness to an individual or an organisation but a sense of solidarity with unknown others in the community . in the case of embryo donation , what appears to be a directly reciprocal act of gratitude  a surplus embryo in return for treatment  may thus be understood as something quite different . participants in our studies used a rationale for donation based not on reciprocal exchange between individuals , but on  giving back to  a research enterprise from which they had benefited and which they hoped would benefit unknown others in the future . for the swiss and chinese donors who choose to donate because they think they are supporting infertility research , these unknown others are not completely anonymous : they are  known  because of imaginatively shared experience .  giving something back  to the research that had helped them ( as they think they are doing ) was not considered an obligation but , rather , a form of return that was meaningful and seemed especially fitting to them because of the experiences they had gone through . in the u.k . study , although there was greater clarity about the purpose of the research being contributed to , there was still a sense among embryo providers that they were benefiting from the fact that others had participated in research in the past which had improved ivf ; they were clear in expressing solidarity with this imagined community of previous ivf research contributors by making their own contributions to research , albeit research in another domain . at least some of our participants , then , also see their donation to research as an indirect way of passing on the benefit they have received from research to someone else , whose situation in some way resembles their own . the social meaning of this indirect reciprocity is neither gratitude nor indebtedness , but solidarity with other present and future patients . to summarise : our interpretation of the material suggests that donors reasons for donating were not connected in any straightforward way to either gratitude or indebtedness . for some people the desire not to waste a valuable ( in more than one sense ) resource is foremost . a generally positive stance toward biomedical science means that donation is a good use of a valuable resource . with some of the swiss participants , we also identified a reparative urge coming from a sense of moral unease , and here donation seems to offer a route through which the urge to make reparation can be satisfied . all of this suggests that neither gratitude nor indebtedness per se are present in decision - making at the ivf  stem cell interface , at least not in terms of undue inducement or of compromising the capacity for informed consent . the reparative urge foregrounds a different set of ethical questions about the sociomoral meaning of the generation of spare embryos and the act of donation . for example , the perceived need for reparation that appears to drive some of the swiss participants donation choices arises because people felt some sense of wrongdoing at creating embryos that are not used for pregnancy . the spirit of the swiss legal framework strongly reinforces the sense that the occurrence of embryos not used for pregnancy is to be considered as wrong . from this point of view , one possible conclusion could be that the felt desire for reparation is in fact an ethically appropriate response : if the act of deliberately creating an embryo is a morally significant one , which needs to be justified by the good of its intended outcome ( pregnancy ) , then not using it for the purpose that justifies it does indeed present a genuine ethical difficulty . on the other hand , the novelty of surplus embryos in the swiss legal and social context ( scully and rehmann - sutter 2006 ) meant that many patients would have been unaware at the time of their ivf of the possibility of generating a surplus embryo . moreover , in most cases there were perfectly valid clinical or legal reasons why the embryos could not be transferred , which fully justified the failure to use them as originally intended . that these factors were not in the participants control the swiss participants were quite aware of the valid reasons why their embryos could not be transferred , and yet some of them still said that they had fallen short of some moral standard . we suggest that this persistent unease ( which does not appear so prevalent in the u.k . these are captured in swiss legislation s highly defensive attitude toward embryos in general and the generation of surplus embryos in particular . swiss law operates from the presumption that a surplus embryo is an exceptional event that will happen only through the failure of regulation and practice specifically set up to prevent it ( porz et al . in addition , as we discussed earlier , the generation of surplus embryos is still an unfamiliar social practice and the role of the embryo donor is one that lacks widespread cultural recognition . in the swiss context of legal exceptionalism , then , producing one of these culturally unfamiliar entities may more readily be understood as something wrong  for which reparation is in order . in the more permissive cultural and legislative context of the united kingdom , although some interviewees expressed guilt about other aspects of the process ( for example , inappropriate styles of speech about embryos ) , there was no sense that not using the embryos as intended in itself constituted a moral failing . if our interpretation is correct , as the creation of surplus embryos becomes normalised in swiss society and the role of embryo donor becomes normalised in both the u.k . and swiss ( and other ) societies , there will be a shift in ideas about the moral meaning of surplus embryos , and this should be empirically testable . for the majority of the participants in switzerland and the united kingdom who chose to donate their surplus embryos , donation decisions were not driven by a reparative urge but by the feeling that donation expressed solidarity with research and/or other patients . what our empirical work shows is that gratitude to an individual must be distinguished from a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research . however , this does not necessarily mean that solidarity - based reciprocity has no relevant impact on the capacity for voluntary consent . one possible consequence , for example , is that if potential donors feel solidarity with the research enterprise , or with present and future patients , then they might also experience an obligation to support it . however , in all three studies there were people who chose not to donate ( about half of the swiss interviewees did not donate , while in the united kingdom approximately 46 percent of those asked have been shown to opt against donation [ choudhary et al . 2004 ] ) , which suggests either that there is no sense of obligation , or that it is neither universal nor irresistible . there is a second problem if solidarity - based reciprocity is taken as something to be prevented . if there is a risk that gratitude felt by an individual could influence donation decisions , then the risk can be minimised by separating ivf and stem cell research physically and procedurally , as bioethicists have suggested and some clinics and guidelines have implemented . but if instead there is a desire to benefit research or to show solidarity with collective  others  rather than an individual , then what sort of physical or procedural barriers could be set up to prevent it having an influence ? there are further theoretical questions to be explored here about the assumption that contextual emotions such as gratitude or solidarity compromise the decision to donate . the situation in which donation of a surplus embryo is a possibility comes about as a result of a variety of social , cultural , political , legal , and emotional features that combine to make the situation what it is . it will be important to identify carefully the features that are constitutive of the situation of having a surplus embryo ( including a sense of solidarity to similar others , emotional bonds with the embryo that change over time , regret over the failure to use all embryos for pregnancy , and so on ) and to consider whether these constitutive features can or should also be treated as factors that compromise the responsible , autonomous decision - making capacity of the people involved . this introduces the question of the extent to which any decision to donate can be detached from its context and the contextual factors that shape how people respond to donation requests . finally , we should not forget that the possibility that some donors misunderstand the kind of research they are donating to raises some ethical difficulty . it means that donors may be deciding for donation out of a misplaced sense of solidarity  a different ethical problem . the deliberative processes of the donor participants in our three studies incorporated their appreciation of the particular moral value of their own embryos and of the value of biomedical research . these deliberations are complex , and the participants own dependency on pre - existing medical research and their affiliation with others in similar situations must be recognised , we suggest , in order to understand how they might configure donation as a means to cope with the moral ambivalence of the situation in which they find themselves . their decisions are not driven by some unacknowledged sense of debt , but rather are responsive to the emerging social and moral reality of embryo donation in the first decade of the 21st century .","this paper is based on linked qualitative studies of the donation of human embryos to stem cell research carried out in the united kingdom , switzerland , and china . 
 all three studies used semi - structured interview protocols to allow an in - depth examination of donors and non - donors rationales for their donation decisions , with the aim of gaining information on contextual and other factors that play a role in donor decisions and identifying how these relate to factors that are more usually included in evaluations made by theoretical ethics . 
 our findings have implications for one factor that has previously been suggested as being of ethical concern : the role of gratitude . 
 our empirical work shows no evidence that interpersonal gratitude is an important factor , but it does support the existence of a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research . 
 thus , we use empirical data to expand and refine the conceptual basis of bioethically theorizing the ivf  stem cell interface .",187
"fibromyalgia syndrome ( fms ) is a prevalent chronic pain condition among middle - aged females 
 and is characterized by chronic widespread pain . various comorbid symptoms of fms include 
 fatigue , cognitive disturbances , depression , sleep impairments , and weight gain , to name but 
 a few . it is a challenging disorder , and thus assessment and diagnosis might pose some 
 difficulties in various health care settings . patients may visit their general practitioners 
 repeatedly with numerous symptoms before a diagnosis of fms is made1 , 2 . patients are encountered at not only primary but also secondary health care settings and by 
 various subspecialities including rheumatologists , pain specialists , physiatrists , and 
 psychologists . this has led to debate about whether fms is a clinical or epidemiological 
 disease3 . the 1990 american college of rheumatology ( acr ) criteria included 2 major sections : history 
 of widespread pain and pain in 11 of 18 tender points on digital palpation . debates over 
 reliability , validity , and number of tender points required to make a diagnosis were 
 settled . many controversies arose over tender points4 , and some authors argued against tender points , claiming that they 
 are a measure of general stress3 , 5 , 6 . it 
 was then suggested that dealing with the symptoms rather than tender points would be more 
 realistic and that use of 1990 criteria should be stopped7 . the acr 2010 criteria eliminated the controversial tender point examination and included 
 the following headings : widespread pain index , including 19 pain locations , and symptom 
 severity score for 3 symptoms plus the extent of 41 somatic symptoms in general . 2010 
 criteria further modified to the 2011 modified criteria ( 2011modcr ) with 6 self - reported 
 symptoms instead of 41 somatic symptoms . the most recently developed criteria are the 
 alternative diagnostic criteria ( acr 2013altcr ) , which include more pain locations than the 
 2011modcr ( 28 instead of 19 ) and 10 symptoms instead of 6 . compared to the 2011modcr , the 
 acr 2013altcr have comparable diagnostic sensitivity , better specificity , and a smaller 
 number needed to diagnose8 . in addition to the search for best criteria , some other tools were developed for 
 epidemiological studies such as the london fibromyalgia study screening questionnaire or 
  survey criteria . however , they included only items related to pain and fatigue , neglecting 
 other aspects of the condition9 . to 
 address these problems , some screening procedures have been suggested ; however , they have 
 been argued against due to psychometric validation problems and sensitivity and specificity 
 issues10 . thus , a need for a short , easy - to - use , psychometrically validated screening tool has arisen 
 in both clinical and research settings . the french rheumatic pain study group decided to 
 develop a short , psychometrically sound , self - reported screening tool considering the major 
 symptoms and aspects of fms9 . the original 
 version of the fibromyalgia rapid screening tool ( first ) was demonstrated to have excellent 
 discriminative properties , especially divergent validity in terms of psychological aspect , 
 which is an important property for an fms screening tool9 . the spanish version of the first was also demonstrated to have 
 acceptable internal consistency , reliability , and criterion validity10 . we aimed to study the reliability and validity of the turkish version of the first by 
 correlating this tool with the acr 2013altcr and the hospital anxiety and depression scale 
 ( hads ) . two hundred and sixty - nine patients ( 257 females and 12 males ) with an average age ( years ) 
 of 48.29  12.78 ( range 2279 ) were included in the study . the principles of the declaration of helsinki were followed 
 and the study protocol was approved by the uludag university ethical committee ( no : 
 fr - hyh-19 ) . subjects were recruited from outpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation 
 clinics from 9 medical faculty hospitals and ministry of health research and training 
 hospitals . a convenience sample of patients with chronic diffuse pain was included in the study . literate patients who could read and understand turkish and who were able to complete the 
 questionnaire were invited to participate in the study . patients with psychiatric disorders ( severe depression , schizophrenia ) or systemic or 
 neurological disorders that could adversely affect quality of life or social functioning 
 ( such as end - stage heart failure , hemiplegia , spinal cord injury , etc . ) were excluded from 
 the study . we obtained permission from mapi research trust ( contact information and permission to use : 
 mapi research trust , lyon , france . e - mail : proinformation@mapi-trust.org-internet : 
 www.proqolid.org . ) cross - cultural adaptation was accomplished according to the suggestions 
 of the mapi research institute in 3 steps : forward translation , backward translation , and 
 patient testing . the first was translated into turkish by 2 professional native turkish speakers bilingual 
 in turkish and english . they discussed on the translated forms with the local project 
 manager ( r.c . ) to resolve discrepancies and produced a pooled version , which is the first 
 version of the translation ( step 1 ) . then , english back - translation was done by the 
 professional native english - speaking translator bilingual in english and turkish . he 
 translated the first version of the questionnaire back to english without access to the 
 original questionnaire . the local project manager compared the backward version with the 
 original during a meeting with the backward translator and prepared the second version ( step 
 2 ) . the second version was tested on 5 patients , all of whom were native turkish speakers , 
 and comprehension was determined through face - to - face interviews . after this final step , a 
 third version of the questionnaire patients were asked to complete the questionnaire including the first , 2013altcr , and hads . they completed the first twice ; the time interval for the 2 first scales was 6 hours . the 
 first includes 6 items , and a score of 1 is given for the response of  yes  and 0 if the 
 response is  no  for each item . the total score is calculated as the sum of scores ; the 
 cut - off value is designated as 5/69 . the examiners were physiatrists and they were blinded to the results of first and hads . we 
 used the acr 2013altcr8 , which includes 
 the pain location inventory ( pli ) including 28 sites and the symptom impact questionnaire 
 ( siqr ) consisting of 10 symptom items ( pain ; energy ; stiffness ; sleep ; depression ; memory 
 problems ; anxiety ; tenderness to touch ; balance problems ; and sensitivity to loud noises , 
 bright colors , odors , and cold ) . pli score is between 0 and 28 , and the siqr range is 0100 
 divided by 2 . for a patient to fulfill the acr 2013altcr criteria , the symptoms and pain 
 locations should have been persistent for at least 3 months , pli17 and siqr21 . one for anxiety and the 
 other for depression  and is a questionnaire completed by the patient . each item has 4 
 possible answers ( range 03 ) , and the maximum possible score is 21 . the validity and 
 reliability of the turkish version of the hads was demonstrated previously11 . concurrent validity of anxiety subscale 
 with spielberger s trait anxiety inventory , correlation coefficient was 0.7544 and of 
 depression subscale with beck depression inventory it was 0.7237 . testing the reliability of 
 had scale , cronbach alfa coefficient for anxiety subscale was 0.8525 and for depression 
 subscale it was 0.778411 . we analyzed the data using the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) version 
 16 ( chicago , il , usa ) . the reliability of the 
 hads was tested using cronbach s alpha coefficient . for criterion validity of the first , we 
 used the acr 2013altcr for comparison . the 
 concordance between the acr 2013altcr and the first was evaluated using a mcnemar test . the sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative likelihood ratios of the first were 
 calculated according to acr 2013altcr criteria . we compared 
 the 2 first measurements using wilcoxon signed rank test , and the 2 measurements were 
 statistically similar ( p=0.169 ) . one hundred fifty - six ( 58% ) patients had score of 5 , which is the cut - off score for the 
 first ; 116 of these patients ( 74.4% ) were diagnosed as having fms according to acr 2013altcr 
 criteria . one hundred thirteen patients ( 42% ) had first scores lower than 5 , and 93 of these 
 patients ( 82.3% ) did not meet the 2013altcr criteria . the first was not statistically 
 different from the acr 2013 altcr in defining patients with fms ( table 1table 1.sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative likelihood ratios of the

 significant logistic regression analysis was carried out to find the confounding effect of the hads on 
 the first to discriminate the patients with fms . the model was able to discriminate patients 
 with fibromyalgia and without fibromyalgia ( 2 log likelihood=274.82 ; =95.29 , 
 d.f=2 ; p < 0.001 ; nagelkerke r= 0.4 ) . the first global score explained 30% of 
 the proportion of uncertainty ; each point increase in first global score meant 10 times 
 greater odds of experiencing fms . in this study , we showed that the turkish version of the first is a reliable 
 patient - completed instrument for identifying patients with fms . the acr 2013altcr was used 
 for comparison , and the first was similar to the acr criteria in terms of defining patients 
 with fms . the first demonstrated high correlation with acr 2013altcr subscores and hads 
 scores . in our study , we examined the consistency of the first over time . we used the acr 2013altcr because these criteria were equally efficient with somewhat 
 better specificity , and a smaller number was needed to diagnose than in the 2011modcr8 . the acr 2013altcr were also marginally more 
 efficient in differentiating common chronic pain disorders from fms8 . torres et al.10 used acr 1990 criteria , and perrot et al.9 stated that they diagnosed patients on the basis of acr 
 criteria , referring to the article by wolfe et al . , who used the symptom intensity scale , 
 which is a combination of pain counts in 19 nonarticular regions with a visual analogue 
 scale for fatigue12 . torres et al . reported the sensitivity of the first as 90.5% and its specificity as 85.7% . the turkish version demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity . in this study by 
 torres et al . positive likelihood ratio was calculated as 1.99 and negative likelihood ratio 
 as 0.2 for cut - off point of 5 which is the established score for the original version of 
 first . in our study positive and negative likelihood ratio values were 2.65 and 0.24 
 respectively , with fairly narrow confidence intervals . our study group was similar to torres 
 et al.10 ; the majority of the patients in 
 the study by torres were female , as in our study group . in the original study of the first 
 by perrot et al.9 , first total score was 
 not significantly correlated with the beck depression inventory , hads - depression , and 
 hads - anxiety scores . in our study , we were able to demonstrate that first scores are 
 correlated with hads scores ; however , despite the correlation of first with hads scores , the 
 first was still able to discriminate between patients with and without fms . different from previous studies , we included patients with various chronic pain problems at 
 a tertiary care level . fitzcharles et al . argued that , if patients in a study have an 
 established diagnosis of fms , they may express symptom severity at the extreme end of the 
 spectrum , thus increasing construct validity13 . similar to our study , bennett et al.8 included a wide range of common pain disorders as the dominating 
 principle of their study and claimed to simulate everyday clinical practice . both rehabilitation specialists and physical therapists are dealing with various pain 
 conditions . among these disorders fms is a prevalent condition and can be encountered

"the heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) is a 
 molecular chaperone which 
 plays an important function in protein homeostasis as well as in cell 
 signaling and survival . some of its functions include 
 folding newly synthesized peptides , refolding misfolded proteins , 
 assembling multiprotein complexes , and transporting proteins across 
 cellular membranes . in addition to these housekeeping functions , hsp70 
 is an important regulator of malignant transformation , both through 
 its role as a powerful antiapoptotic protein and as a cochaperone 
 of heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) . as a cochaperone of hsp90 , 
 hsp70 is thought to load client proteins onto the hsp90 machinery 
 through the action of another cochaperone , heat shock organizing protein 
 ( hop ) . the hsp90 machinery is an important mechanism 
 by which cancer cells regulate the function of several cancer - driving 
 proteins , such as those involved in altered signaling , the cell cycle , 
 and transcriptional regulation . indeed , it is primarily for this reason 
 that hsp90 has been actively pursued as an anticancer target . as an antiapoptotic molecule , hsp70 acts at multiple points in the 
 apoptotic pathway to prevent cell death . due to these functions , it is not surprising that hsp70 is frequently overexpressed in cancer , 
 where the elevated expression is furthermore believed to be a cause 
 of or to lead to resistance to chemotherapy and other treatments . these dual roles of hsp70 in cancer , i.e. , cochaperone 
 of hsp90 and antiapoptotic molecule , suggest that inhibition of hsp70 
 may offer a valuable anticancer strategy , as supported by hsp70 knockdown 
 studies . indeed , hsp70 is an important 
 and highly sought after cancer target , and as such it is of no surprise that the discovery 
 and development of hsp70 inhibitors is currently a hot topic . to identify druglike hsp70 inhibitors , we took a structure - based 
 approach . in the first preceding paper in this issue , we described 
 the development of inhibitors that target an allosteric pocket of 
 hsp70 located in the n - terminal domain of the protein . this pocket , not evident in the available crystal 
 structures of hsp70 , has been recently identified by us through computational 
 analyses . thus , in the absence of an 
 appropriate x - ray structure of human hsp70 , we used this homology 
 model to design ligands that could bind to the hsp70 allosteric pocket . 
 because the pocket also harbors a potentially reactive cysteine residue , 
 the initially designed inhibitors , all built around the 2,5-thiodipyrimidine 
 and 5-(phenylthio)pyrimidine scaffolds , also incorporated an acrylamide 
 moiety suitably positioned to interact with this amino acid upon insertion 
 into the binding site ( figure 1 ) . this body 
 of work led to the identification of low micromolar inhibitors of 
 hsp70 with a good cell permeability profile and potent and selective 
 biological activity in several cancer cells through an hsp70-mediated 
 mechanism of action . our data indicated a good fit for these molecules 
 inside the hsp70 pocket , suggesting that enthalpy played an important 
 role in their interaction with the protein . chemical 
 structure of acrylamide - containing 2,5-thiodipyrimidine 
 and 5-(phenylthio)pyrimidine scaffold hsp70 inhibitors that were designed 
 to insert into the hsp70 allosteric pocket and form a covalent bond 
 with cys267 upon binding . the yellow surface shows the geometry of 
 the allosteric pocket as determined by sitemap ( schrodinger llc , new 
 york ) . in addition to being good leads , 
 these compounds were also useful 
 in demonstrating the therapeutic relevance of inhibiting the novel 
 allosteric hsp70 pocket as a potential anticancer approach . specifically , by inserting into the allosteric 
 pocket , these inhibitors alter the oncogenic hsp70hsp90client 
 complexes , resulting in degradation of hsp90hsp70onco - client 
 proteins and inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis . they do so without activating a feedback heat shock response , a mechanism believed to be responsible for limiting 
 the anticancer activity of hsp90 inhibitors . the hsp90hsp70 machinery is also a known repressor of heat 
 shock factor 1 ( hsf-1 ) . inhibition of 
 hsp90 , but not depletion of the hsp90 cochaperones hsp70 , hop , hip , 
 p23 , and cyp40 , led to hsf-1 activation , possibly because while these 
 cochaperones participate with hsp90 in the regulation of hsf-1 , only 
 hsp90 plays a nonredundant role in repressing its heat shock activation 
 ability . activation of hsf-1 has a protective 
 effect on the cancer cell as it leads to the upregulation of antiapoptotic 
 molecules . thus , hsp70 allosteric inhibitors 
 by differentiating between the regulatory activity of the hsp90hsp70 
 machinery on onco - clients and on hsf-1 may result in more robust apoptosis 
 in cancer cells when compared to hsp90 inhibitors . here we focus 
 on the identification of inhibitors that act on hsp70 
 through reversible binding into the allosteric pocket . although covalent 
 inhibition may offer certain advantages ( i.e. , maintaining activity 
 against mutations and the ability to inhibit the target in the presence 
 of millimolar concentrations of atp within the cell ) and can be desirable 
 in some instances , it may come with some drawbacks . because of the presence of a reactive moiety , covalent 
 inhibitors have a greater potential for off - target effects , such as 
 inherent reactivity toward nonspecific thiols such as glutathione . therefore , we desired molecules that could also 
 act in this pocket in a reversible manner . at this early point in 
 hsp70 drug discovery , it is not clear which mode is best ; therefore , 
 we thought it wise to pursue both , and in this paper we show our initial 
 efforts in the elaboration of a covalent inhibitor targeting the allosteric 
 site into a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of low micromolar 
 potency . the design of reversible ligands for the allosteric 
 hsp70 pocket 
 took advantage of our knowledge on the geometry of the allosteric 
 pocket and the structure activity 
 relationship ( sar ) we have learned from previous studies in the irreversible 
 ligand series ( figure 2 ) . our tactic was to first take a localized approach in an 
 attempt to phase out the covalent binding potential and to maximize 
 noncovalent binding in this immediate region ( modification on x4 ) . then we took a global molecular perspective to probe and 
 to enhance interaction in other parts of the molecule ( modification 
 on x3 , rings a and b , x5 , and x6 ) . specifically , our modifications focused on replacing the acrylamide 
 ( x4 ) with a favorable noncovalent modifying functionality 
 and on altering the nature of rings a and b ( figure 2a , highlighted in blue ) . they then aimed to gain additional 
 favorable enthalpy by filling out a hydrophobic pocket now only occupied 
 by small x5,6 groups such as methoxy ( figure 2a , highlighted in blue , and figure 2b , red circle ) . favorable modifications , such as methylpiperazine 
 at position x7 , were left mostly unchanged ( figure 2a ) . design of the reversible hsp70 inhibitors and their proposed 
 mode 
 of interaction with the hsp70 pocket . ( a ) general strategy that indicates 
 modifications that are explored here in the design of reversible inhibitors 
 ( highlighted in blue ) . ( b ) step - by - step process that highlights key 
 modifications that led to 27c , a reversible hsp70 binder 
 of activity rivaling that of the most potent irreversible inhibitor 1e . thus , our overall design 
 strategy entailed ( 1 ) determination of 
 the extent of dependence of covalent modification for activity by 
 replacing the acrylamide with groups that could provide favorable 
 but noncovalent interaction with cysteine , ( 2 ) exploration of the 
 sar to maximize noncovalent interactions within the pocket occupied 
 by acrylamide , and ( 3 ) exploration of the sar in other parts of the 
 molecule to maximize binding affinity . modifying the acrylamide 
 was based on several observations . as mentioned above , our modeling 
 studies indicated that the region of hsp70 occupied by x4 also contained leu237 , val238 , arg264 , asp234 , and lys271 in addition 
 to the reactive cys267 ( figure 2a ) . while the 
 ability to form a covalent bond with the cysteine added significantly 
 to the potency of the irreversible inhibitors , modeling studies indicated 
 that the alkene moiety of the acrylamide group was positioned to also 
 form hydrophobic interactions with adjacent protein residues , including 
 leu237 and val238 , while its carbonyl was poised to form electrostatic 
 interactions with arg264 ( figure 2a ) . therefore , 
 we reasoned that suitable groups substituted at x4 would 
 be capable of interacting with these residues in a wholly noncovalent 
 manner . in our initial design of reversible ligands , we kept the amide 
 functionality of x4 but modified the alkene with a variety 
 of groups ( r , figure 2a ) incapable of interacting 
 with cysteine covalently . these included alkyl groups of various sizes 
 as well as aryl groups ( r = methyl , ethyl , cyclopropyl , cyclobutyl , 
 cyclohexyl , n - heptyl , allyl , phenyl , and furanyl ) 
 to probe the extent of modifications allowed by the pocket at this 
 position . we also replaced the acrylamide with substituents that could 
 potentially establish an ionic pair interaction with the s of cys267 ( i.e. , ionizable amines such as in 7f ( r 
 = aminomethyl ) and 9 ( r = 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl ) ) ( tables 1 and 2 ) . inhibition of growth measured in 
 kasumi-1 acute myeloid leukemia cells . ring b 
 is predicted to occupy the lower part 
 of the binding site that also contains arg264 . thus , the ligand s 
 interaction with the pocket could potentially be stabilized by cation 
 interactions between the aromatic ring of ring b and the guanidine 
 group of arginine ( figure 2a ) . cation interactions play an important role 
 in protein structure and molecular recognition and can contribute significantly 
 to the binding energy of a ligand . such 
 interactions are more likely to occur between an electron - rich  
 system ( i.e. , phenyl , ethylene , acetylene ) and a neighboring cation 
 and furthermore are generally favored with heterocycles that incorporate 
 lone pair electrons into the aromatic system ( i.e. , indole , pyrrole ) 
 and become deactivated when the lone pair does not contribute to aromaticity 
 ( i.e. , pyridine , pyrimidine ) . in the 
 irreversible series , pyrimidine was favored for ring b ; the two nitrogen 
 atoms of the pyrimidine ring rendered the ring more electron deficient , 
 thus activating the acrylamide s michael acceptor capability . in the reversible series , on the other hand , 
 electron - rich b rings should be favored over electron - deficient ones 
 because of their higher propensity toward cation interactions 
 with arg264 ( figure 2a ) . to test the hypothesis , 
 we made compounds in which ring b was either phenyl ( i.e. , activating ) 
 or pyrimidine ( i.e. , deactivating ) ( tables 1 and 2 ) . ring a and 
 its substituents x5 and x6 are placed midpocket . our initial investigations have mainly explored small substituents 
 at this position such as methoxy , ethoxy , and methyl . it is lined by amino acids that could provide 
 hydrophobic ( val59 , tyr41 , phe68 , trp90 ) and electrostatic ( arg261 ) 
 interactions with the ligand ( figure 2a ) . therefore , 
 we explored here the effects of larger substituents on ring a , especially 
 those poised for interactions within the lipophilic pocket formed 
 by tyr41 , phe68 , and trp90 , such as derivatives in which x5 contains an aryl ( red circle in figure 2b 
 and table 3 ) . we also disrupted the symmetry 
 of these molecules around ring a by probing monosubstitution of the 
 ring ( x5  x6 = h , figure 2b ) . ring b orients its x3 substituent 
 toward several important pocket residues such 
 as asp234 and glu268 ( x3 is nh2 in 1a , figure 2a ) . nh2 at this position 
 is poised to form hydrogen bonds with their carboxylate groups , and 
 we retained this functionality from the irreversible series in the 
 design of new derivatives . the introduction of an nh2 at this position was synthetically challenging when ring b was phenyl , 
 and for these , hydrogen was introduced at x3 . thus , all 
 compounds of this series contain either an nh2 or a h at 
 position x3 . our previous 
 sar also showed 
 that n - methylpiperazine was a preferred substituent 
 on ring a at position x7 , presumably because of a proper 
 fit in the minor groove located at the exit of the binding site and 
 because it could form a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone 
 carbonyl of his89 ( figure 2a for 1a ) . as a result , the 
 synthesis of all designed compounds evaluated in this study 
 is shown in schemes 13 . target compounds 3a  d and 4a  e were prepared by reaction of 2a  d with the appropriate acid chloride 
 ( scheme 1 ) . similarly , 
 target compounds 7a  h were prepared 
 by reaction of 6a , b with the appropriate 
 acid chloride ( scheme 1 ) . thioethers 6a and 6b were prepared by cui / neocuproine - catalyzed 
 coupling of iodo derivative 5a or 5b , respectively , 
 with 3-aminothiophenol ( scheme 1 ) . 9 was prepared by michael addition of dimethylamine to 8 with dbu ( scheme 1 ) . bromopyridine 10 was reacted with n - methylpiperazine 
 at 130 c for 16 h to give 11 in 88% yield . 12 was obtained in 95% yield 
 following reaction of 11 with nis at rt . 12 was coupled to 4-amino-2-mercaptopyrimidine with cui / neocuproine 
 to give thioether 13 in 60% yield . acylation of 13 with propionyl chloride or cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride 
 resulted in 14a or 14b , respectively . coupling 
 of 12 with 3-aminothiophenol resulted in 15 , which was acylated with various acid chlorides to give target compounds 16a  d . 17 was obtained from 
 demethylation of 11 by refluxing in 48% hbr(aq ) along 
 with a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium bromide . following pmb 
 protection and reaction with nis , iodo derivative 19 was 
 obtained , which was coupled with 3-aminothiophenol to give thioether 20 . reaction of 20 with boc - glycine and subsequent 
 deprotection with tfa resulted in 21 . first , 2,4-dichloropyrimidine ( 22 ) was reacted with 
 benzyl alcohol under ptc conditions to result in a regioisomeric mixture 
 of the desired 4-(benzyloxy)-2-chloropyrimidine ( 23a ) 
 along with 2-(benzyloxy)-4-chloropyrimidine in a ratio of 75:25 , respectively . this mixture was used directly in the next step and reacted with n - methylpiperazine to give 24a , which was obtained 
 pure following chromatography . after iodination with nis to yield 25a and further coupling with 3-aminobenzenethiol , 26a was obtained . 27a  f was then obtained 
 by reaction of the appropriate acid chloride with 26a . phenyl - substituted analogue 27 g was obtained by a 
 similar route used for compounds 27a  f ; however , the first step in the synthesis utilized a suzuki coupling 
 to install a phenyl group selectively onto the 4-position of 22 to yield 23b ( scheme 3 ) . our target - derived biological 
 investigation was based on a specific 
 battery of assays that we designed to probe hsp70-derived mechanisms 
 in a cancer cell . these include biochemical 
 and phenotypic assays that probe biological effects that stem from 
 alteration of the hsp70hop these biological 
 tests were paralleled by computational studies , and each derivative 
 was docked into the allosteric pocket of hsp70 to understand the contribution 
 of each chemical modification to the observed biological activity . our first step toward the potential realization of reversible inhibitors 
 involved removing the reactive acrylamide moiety . rewardingly , elimination 
 of the covalent mode of binding by isosteric replacement of the acrylamide 
 to ethylamide diminished the biological activity by only 1 log ( i.e. , 1a vs 3a , 1b vs 4b , 1c vs 7a , and 1d vs 4c , tables 1 and 4 ) while 
 retaining an hsp70-driven mechanism of action ( table 1 and figure 3 ) . specifically , when 
 cancer cells were incubated with select derivatives ( i.e. , 1a and 3a , acrylamide- and ethylamide - containing derivatives , 
 respectively ) , we observed dissociation of hsp70hop complexes 
 at concentrations at which we also noted degradation of the hsp70 
 onco - client protein kinase , her2 ( figure 3 ) . as previously mentioned , hop is a cochaperone that bridges hsp70 and 
 hsp90 to form the megachaperone complex that regulates the stability 
 of several onco - client proteins , such as her2 and raf-1 . when these 
 complexes become disrupted , the client proteins ( i.e. , her2 and raf-1 ) 
 become unstable and are cleared through the proteasome pathway . as mentioned above , the pocket occupied by the 
 x4 substituent contains leu237 , val238 , and cys267 , and 
 the ethyl group of 3a would be well positioned to form 
 hydrophobic interactions with these residues . her2 and raf-1 steady - state levels , 
 parp cleavage and inhibition of growth measured in skbr3 breast cancer 
 cells . binding to skbr3 
 cell extracts tested 
 at the maximum concentration allowed by solubility . skbr3 cells were treated for 
 24 h with vehicle 
 or indicated concentrations of 1a or 3a . dissociation : upon cell lysing , hsp70 complexes were 
 isolated with an anti - hsp70 antibody ( ip bb70 ) and analyzed by western 
 blotting ( wb ) . her2 degradation : proteins in the lysate were analyzed by immonoblotting 
 with an anti - her2 antibody . gels were quantified by densitometry , values normalized 
 to the control ( vehicle only treated cells ) , and data graphed against 
 the hsp70 inhibitor concentration . we wanted to explore the further potential of increasing 
 potency 
 by exploring this pocket with r groups of various sizes and to take 
 advantage of potential hydrophobic interactions within the pocket . 
 substituting ethyl with methyl ( i.e. , 3c and 4a ) diminished activity , while cyclopropyl at this position slightly 
 increased activity ( i.e. , 4c vs 4e and 3a vs 7b , table 1 , x1,2 = n ) . substitution of ethyl with groups such as allyl or 
 cyclobutyl ( i.e. , 7a vs 7 g and 7c ) led to no significant change in activity , suggesting that such 
 groups can be accommodated in this site , but that no additional favorable 
 interactions were possible . much larger hydrophobic substituents at 
 this position abolished both activity ( i.e. , n - heptyl 
 in 3d , steric clashes with asn235 , leu237 , val238 , and 
 val260 ) and solubility ( i.e. , cyclohexyl 
 in 7d ) , which in the latter case precluded biological 
 evaluation . we also found that flat , conformationally restricted 
 aromatic groups 
 were well tolerated at this position and in fact significantly improved 
 activity . specifically , the 2-furanyl derivative ( i.e. , 4d ) was 23-fold more potent than the corresponding ethyl and 
 cyclopropyl derivatives ( i.e. , 4c and 4e , respectively ) and only 5-fold less potent than the corresponding 
 acrylamide derivative ( i.e. , 1d ) ( table 1 ) . even more favored was a phenyl at this position ( i.e. , 7e ) , this compound being 810-fold more active than 
 the corresponding ethyl derivative ( i.e. , 7a ) ( tables 1 and 4 ) . such an increase 
 in potency for hydrophobic and -electron - containing r groups 
 may be explained by enhanced hydrophobic interactions with leu237 , 
 val238 , leu263 , and phe241 or a potential s interaction 
 between the sulfur of cys267 and the r group . such favorable interactions 
 between sulfur and  aromatic systems were first suggested by 
 morgan et al . , and a number of stable 
 orientations are possible , including one where the sulfur is positioned 
 3.54.0  above the plane of the aromatic ring and another 
 where the sulfur is positioned slightly above ( 2.5  ) 
 and to the edge ( 4.56.0  ) of the aromatic ring . both orientations have been found to occur with 
 cysteine residues in proteins , and recently a s h/ interaction 
 was proposed to rationalize the binding affinity of an flt3 kinase 
 inhibitor . our second approach 
 toward enhancing activity within the pocket 
 was to take advantage of the native cysteine residue and its potential 
 to form ionic interactions through its side chain thiolate ( s ) . we attempted to take advantage of such an interaction 
 by incorporating an amine group at the same position as the -carbon 
 of the michael acceptor acrylamide in 1a . an increase in potency was observed for r substituents that could 
 potentially be positively ionized and form an ionic pair with s of cysteine ( 2-aminomethyl in 7f and 16d ) . indeed , 2-aminomethyl appears to favorably position 
 its amine , which is likely protonated at physiological ph , to interact 
 with the sulfur of cysteine ( i.e. , 7f in table 1 and 16d in table 2 ) . these derivatives have an activity that is comparable to 
 that of the corresponding phenyl and/or furanyl compounds ( 7f vs 7e and 4d , table 1 , and 16d vs 16c , table 2 ) . positioning the amine one carbon away , such as in 9 ( r = 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl , table 1 ) , resulted in activity comparable to that of 7f in 
 the growth inhibition and caspase-3,7 activation assays . in this case , 9 has the potential to undergo bioconversion in cells via 
 -elimination to the corresponding alkene , and therefore , in addition to possible interactions described 
 above , it may also interact with cys267 covalently . having determined 
 these two potential strategies that replace the 
 acrylamide with minimal loss of activity , i.e. , a -electron- 
 or positively ionizable functionality - containing r group , we went 
 on to explore other sites on the molecule that would provide a gain 
 in binding affinity . as mentioned in our design , changing ring b from 
 pyrimidine to phenyl is expected to increase potency by enhancing 
 the interaction of the ring with arg264 . indeed , unlike in the irreversible 
 inhibitor series , where pyrimidine was favored over phenyl because 
 it increased the reactivity of acrylamide for cysteine , in the reversible inhibitor series , we found 
 the opposite to be true ( i.e. , 7a vs 4b and 16b vs 14b , tables 1 and 2 , and additional examples in table 1 ) . arg264 has its guanidinium group positioned atop 
 ring b , thus favorably aligned for cation interactions 
 to occur ( figure 2a ) . thus , an electron - rich aromatic ring , such as phenyl , may form a 
 stronger stacking interaction than pyrimidine with this residue . in 
 heterocycles , where the lone pair does not contribute to aromaticity , 
 the electronegativity of the heteroatom weakens the cation 
 binding ability . we next explored modifications to ring a. having 
 ring a either 
 pyrimidine or pyridine could increase the chemistry feasibility for 
 exploring distinct x5 and x6 combinations on 
 the molecules , and thus , we first explored the effect on activity 
 by changing the nature of the ring . rewardingly , a change from pyrimidine 
 to pyridine led to no substantial change in activity ( i.e. , 7e vs 16c and 7f vs 16d , tables 1 and 2 ) . 
 on the other hand , disrupting the aromaticity of ring a completely 
 abolished activity ( 21 , table 2 ) . 2-hydroxypyridines undergo tautomerism to give pyridones which 
 can behave like amides and exist mainly as the  amide  
 tautomer in most solvents . the dramatic loss of activity observed 
 upon replacing the methoxy group with a hydroxy group at x5 hinted at the importance of this position for binding energy and 
 demonstrates that this group makes significant interactions that are 
 essential for the potency of these compounds . thus , having the 
 ability to use both pyridine and pyrimidine as 
 ring a increased our chemical versatility , and we next explored distinct 
 x5,6 combinations . results with the pyridine series ( table 2 ) showed that disubstitution of x5 and 
 x6 was not necessarily required as having a single methoxy 
 group on the molecule performed as well as having two . this was also 
 observed within the pyrimidine series , as 7h was of potency 
 similar to that of its disubstituted analogue 7f ( table 1 ) . we therefore sought to explore this position 
 further , especially by adding aryl substituents that , as indicated 
 above , would be poised to fill the hydrophobic pocket currently occupied 
 by methoxy ( figure 2b , red circle ) . substitution 
 of x5 with benzyloxy led to a remarkable 1 log increase 
 in potency ( compare 27a to 7a ) . in fact , 
 this derivative was almost as potent as the corresponding acrylamide - containing 
 derivative ( compare 27a to 1c ) . we further 
 increased the activity of this compound once the methyl ( r on x4 ; see figure 2a ) was substituted with 
 a phenyl or aminomethyl ( 27b and 27c , respectively , 
 table 3 ) , both favored x4 substituents 
 ( tables 1 and 2 ) . with 
 aminomethyl being favored at this position , we also probed whether 
 adding hydrophobic bulk to this functionality could lead to a gain 
 in affinity . as indicated above , leu237 and val238 are in the vicinity 
 of cys267 , and thus , there is potential for minor affinity gain by 
 increasing hydrophobicity . replacing the h in 27c with 
 a methyl ( 27d ) or isopropyl ( 27e ) or switching 
 the aminomethyl to 2-pyrrolidinyl ( 27f ) resulted in a 
 minor increase in activity or had no measurable effect on activity 
 ( table 3 ) . changing x5 from 
 benzyloxy to the less flexible phenyl 
 substituent directly attached to the pyrimidine a ring resulted in 
 a significant 10-fold loss of activity ( 27 g , table 3 ) . furthermore , substituting the phenyl ring of 27c with the relatively more polar pyridine in 27h also decreased affinity 5-fold . these results are very much concordant 
 with the proposed mode of binding for these ligands . docking analysis 
 showed that the benzyloxy group can be accommodated in the left - side 
 hydrophobic subpocket ( red circle , figure 2b ) and form hydrophobic interactions with tyr41 , phe68 , and trp90 . 
 for 27 g , the phenyl substituent is not able to orient 
 properly in this cavity and , due to its inflexibility , rather orients 
 toward asp69 and glu231 , providing an explanation for its loss of 
 activity . similarly , replacing the phenyl in 27c with 
 pyridine as in 27h increases the polarity and thus its 
 ability to favorably interact with the hydrophobic residue environment . altogether , and as seen in the irreversible series , our tests demonstrated 
 a good correlation between the predicted binding mode ( figure 2 ) and the observed biological activity ( tables 14 ) of the designed 
 ligands , further consolidating that the biological effect of these 
 molecules in cancer cells is majorly hsp70 mediated . no effect was 
 noted for these compounds on hsp90 at concentrations as high as 500 
 m ( table 4 ) . this ligand 
 combines individual features that this study 
 identifies as most favorable at each evaluated position ; its x4 is glycine , ring b is phenyl , and x5 is benzyloxy 
 ( figure 2b ) . this analogue has an activity 
 in cells comparable to that of the most active reported irreversible 
 inhibitors of this class , namely , low 
 micromolar activity in cancer cells ( figure 4 ) . we found that 27c interfered with the formation of 
 functional hsp70hop  hsp90 machinery as indicated by 
 its ability to dose - dependently alter the megacomplex components and 
 to destabilize an hsp70hsp90 machinery client , raf-1 ( figure 4a ) . hsp90 in concert with hsp70 maintains the transforming 
 capacity of several oncoproteins , including her2 , akt , raf-1 , igf - ir , 
 and hif-1 . when this chaperone complex becomes pharmacologically 
 inhibited , these oncoproteins become destabilized and are degraded 
 mainly by the proteasomal pathway . indeed , we found that the steady - state 
 levels and/or the activity of several oncoproteins involved in increased 
 signaling through a pathogenic pathway were sensitive to hsp70 inhibition 
 by 27c ( figure 4b ) . these signaling 
 oncoproteins include her2 and raf-1 in the her2-overexpressing skbr3 
 breast cancer cells , stat3 and raf-1 in the triple - negative breast 
 cancer mda - mb-468 cells , stat3 , raf-1 , and akt in the miapaca2 pancreatic 
 cancer cells , and mutant flt3 and stat5 in molm13 acute myeloid leukemia 
 cells . 27c also resulted in induction of apoptosis in 
 these cancer cells , as indicated by substantial parp cleavage ( cparp ; 
 figure 4b ) . allosteric ligands with a reversible mode 
 of binding mimic the 
 cellular phenotype observed with the irreversible hsp70 inhibitors . addition of 27c to cancer cells dose - dependently alters 
 the formation of the hsp70hop complex , a phenomenon associated 
 with their destabilization and reduction in half - life ( a ) . it is associated 
 with degradation and/or inhibition of hsp90hsp70 oncoproteins 
 and induction of apoptosis ( b ) . collectively , these data indicate 
 that its mechanism of action is mediated by interaction with the hsp70 
 allosteric pocket in a fashion resembling the interaction of 1e . next , we investigated whether binding of 27c to hsp70 
 interfered with its main biochemical activities , specifically refolding 
 of a denatured client protein ( figure 5 ) . activities are stimulated by hsp40 proteins and nucleotide exchange 
 factors , such as hsp110 . humans have several cytosolic hsp40 s , including hdj1 , dja1 , 
 dja2 , and dja4 , and it has recently been reported that dja2 is most 
 efficient in promoting the refolding of an hsp70 polypeptide substrate , 
 firefly luciferase . in cells , the refolding of heat - denatured luciferase 
 by endogenous as well as transfected hsp70 was inhibited by 27c . the nonspecific capacity of transfected hsp70 to maintain 
 substrate solubility after heat shock was not greatly affected , indicating 
 that 27c , in a manner we reported for 1e , targeted the specific substrate folding 
 activity of hsp70 ( figure 5 ) . the cells were treated with cycloheximide and either 
 vehicle or 27c at 10 m , incubated at 45 c 
 for 1 h , and allowed to recover at 37 c for 2 h ( left ) . cells 
 were lysed during and after refolding , and soluble ha - tagged luciferase 
 and chaperones were detected in the lysates ; exogenous transfected 
 flag - tagged hsp70 is visible as a band above endogenous hsp70 ( middle ) . luciferase enzymatic activities in the lysates were measured at 2 
 h of refolding , unless otherwise indicated , and are represented as 
 percentages of the initial activity before heat shock ( right ) . 27c significantly inhibited endogenous hsp70 and transfected 
 hsp70 in multiple experiments ( n  3 ) . we have shown that significant 
 biological activity may be retained 
 through reversible hsp70 inhibitors targeting an allosteric pocket 
 located at the n - terminal domain . because of the appropriate fit , 
 and thus good enthalpy of binding of the irreversible inhibitors , 
 simple modifications such as replacement of the covalent linkage with 
 an ionic bridge ( yellow , figure 2b ) and filling 
 of the hydrophobic pocket occupied by methoxy in 1e with 
 a benzyloxy ( red , figure 2b ) have led to ligands 
 of reversible mode of binding that not only mimic the phenotype observed 
 with 1e , but do so with similar potency ( figure 4 ) . our data show that the acrylamide group 
 could be eliminated altogether 
 by improving the enthalpy of the binding and indicate that significant 
 binding energy can be attained through additional hydrophobic interactions 
 of x5 substituents with the tyr41 , phe68 , and trp90 residues . this interaction weighs majorly toward the binding of these ligands 
 to the allosteric pocket of hsp70 . combined , the sar data from 
 this and the accompanying paper validate 
 the homology model and the proposed 
 binding of these ligands to the allosteric pocket . first , the model 
 has allowed for the rational design of a ligand that , when incubated 
 with the thousands of proteins expressed in a cancer cell , affinity 
 purified one , hsp70 . second , the correctness of the binding mode analyses 
 has allowed the rational design of specific ligands with a tractable 
 sar . some of these specific ligands as we show have a reversible mode 
 of binding whose potency rivals that of the irreversible ligands , 
 indicating that favorable enthalpy drives the binding of these compounds 
 to hsp70 . third , the concordance in the observed biochemical and phenotypic 
 effects observed with these agents in cancer cells , such as exemplified 
 for 27c , suggests that , in the tested concentration range , 
 the biological activity of these agents is majorly and selectively 
 channeled through an hsp70-binding mechanism . in addition to 
 providing both a novel pharmacophore and medicinal 
 chemistry for its assembly , we describe in our papers a testing battery 
 for assessing hsp70-mediated mechanisms in cancer cells and for evaluating 
 specific ligand action in cancer cells through hsp70 inhibition . therefore , 
 we provide a novel blueprint for a cancer - oriented development of 
 hsp70-directed ligands . in conclusion , our findings propose 
 the allosteric hsp70 inhibitors 
 as important leads toward the development of novel targeted anticancer 
 therapeutics . 27c serves as a molecule for further development 
 that can potentially be elaborated into more potent molecules with 
 in vivo efficacy . we are currently working to further optimize this 
 class of compounds for potency and in vivo activity and will disclose 
 our results in due course . all reagents were purchased from either aldrich

 polarization ( fp ) assays briefly , fp measurements were performed on an 
 analyst gt instrument ( molecular devices , sunnyvale , ca ) . 3650 ) where 
 both the excitation and the emission occurred from the top of the 
 wells . a stock of 10 m gm - cy3b was prepared in dmso and diluted 
 with felts buffer ( 20 mm hepes ( k ) , ph 7.3 , 50 mm kcl , 2 mm dtt , 5 
 mm mgcl2 , 20 mm na2moo4 , and 0.01%

 gm ( gm - cy3b ) , 3 g of skbr3 lysate ( total protein ) , and tested 
 inhibitor ( initial stock in dmso ) in a final volume of 100 l 
 of hfb buffer . background wells ( buffer only ) , tracer controls ( free , fluorescent 
 gm only ) , and bound gm controls ( fluorescent gm in the presence of 
 skbr3 lysate ) were included on each assay plate . the assay plate was incubated on a shaker at 4 c 
 for 24 h , and the fp values ( mp ) were measured . the fraction of tracer 
 bound to hsp90 was correlated to the fp value and plotted against 
 the values of competitor concentrations . the inhibitor concentration 
 at which 50% of bound gm was displaced was obtained by fitting the 
 data . all experimental data were analyzed using softmax pro 4.3.1 
 and plotted using prism 4.0 ( graphpad software inc . , san diego , ca ) . this reagent offers 
 a rapid objective measure of cell viability in cell culture , and it 
 uses the indicator dye resazurin to measure the metabolic capacity 
 of cells , an indicator of cell viability . briefly , cells were plated 
 on costar 96-well plates . for attached cells ( such as skbr3 ) , 8000 
 cells / well were used . for suspension cells ( such as kasumi-1 ) , 20000 
 cells / well were plated . cells were allowed to incubate for 24 h at 
 37 c before drug treatment . drugs were added in triplicate at 
 the indicated concentrations , and the plate was incubated for 72 h. 
 alamar blue ( 50 m ) was added and the plate read 6 h later using 
 the analyst gt ( fluorescence intensity mode , excitation 530 nm , emission 
 580 nm , with a 560 nm dichroic mirror ) . the percentage cell growth inhibition was 
 calculated by comparing fluorescence readings obtained from treated 
 versus control cells , accounting for the initial cell population ( time 
 zero ) . molm-13 cells ( 30000 cells / well ) were 
 plated in black 96-well plates 
 ( corning no . 3603 ) in 40 l of rpmi medium and left in an incubator 
 ( 37 c , 5% co2 ) for up to 24 h. cells were treated

 50 l of buffer containing 10 mm hepes ( ph 7.5 ) , 2 mm edta , 
 0.1% chaps , and the caspase substrate z - devd - r110 at 25 m was 
 added to each well . plates were incubated until the signal stabilized , 
 and then the fluorescence signal of each well was measured in an analyst 
 gt microplate reader . the percentage increase in apoptotic cells was 
 calculated by comparison of the fluorescence reading obtained from 
 treated versus control cells . skbr3 cells were 
 treated with the indicated concentrations of the inhibitor for 24 
 h. samples were collected and lysed in 20 mm tris , ph 7.4 , 25 mm nacl , 
 0.1% np-40 buffer with protease inhibitors added . aliquots of 500 
 g of total protein adjusted to 100 l with the lysis 
 buffer were prepared . samples were incubated with 5 l of bb70 
 antibody ( stressmarq ) or normal igg ( as a negative control ) and 20 
 l of protein g agarose beads ( upstate ) at 4 c overnight . samples were washed five times with the lysis buffer and applied to

 to detect levels of hop protein in the hsp / c70 complexes upon treatment . hek293 cells were transfected with 2 g of luciferase 
 plasmid and 8 g of hsp70 plasmid or control vector per 60 mm 
 dish . human hsp70 , hsp70-c267s , and hsc70 were n - terminally flag - tagged , 
 and luciferase was c - terminally ha - tagged in pcdna3.1 . two days after 
 transfection , cells were treated with cycloheximide ( sigma ) at 50 
 g / ml to inhibit protein synthesis , transferred to 45 c 
 for 1 h , and then brought back to 37 c for up to 2 h of recovery . 27c cell samples , 
 taken before heat shock and at 0 , 1 , and 2 h of recovery , were lysed 
 on ice with pbs containing 1% triton x-100 , and the insoluble material 
 was removed by centrifugation at 20000 g . total protein 
 amounts in the supernatants were determined using the bca protein 
 assay kit ( pierce ) . luciferase enzymatic activities in the supernatants 
 were measured using the luciferase reporter assay kit ( promega ) and 
 activity values normalized to total protein amounts . cells were treated with cycloheximide 
 ( at a final concentration of 100 g / ml ) with added vehicle ( dmso ) 
 or 27c ( 20 m ) for the indicated times . cells were 
 lysed as indicated above , and the resulting samples were analyzed 
 by western blotting .","the 
 discovery and development of heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) 
 inhibitors is currently a hot topic in cancer . in the preceding paper 
 in this issue ( 10.1021/jm401551n ) , we have 
 described structure  activity relationship studies in the first 
 hsp70 inhibitor class rationally designed to bind to a novel allosteric 
 pocket located in the n - terminal domain of the protein . 
 these ligands 
 contained an acrylamide to take advantage of an active cysteine embedded 
 in the allosteric pocket and acted as covalent protein modifiers upon 
 binding . here , we perform chemical modifications around the irreversible 
 inhibitor scaffold to demonstrate that covalent modification is not 
 a requirement for activity within this class of compounds . 
 the study 
 identifies derivative 27c , which mimics the biological 
 effects of the irreversible inhibitors at comparable concentrations . 
 collectively , the back - to - back manuscripts describe the first pharmacophores 
 that favorably and selectively interact with a never explored pocket 
 in hsp70 and provide a novel blueprint for a cancer - oriented development 
 of hsp70-directed ligands .",235
"clavicle fractures occur frequently , with the reported rates ranging between 8% and 15% of all paediatric fractures [ 13 ] . the vast majority of these injuries can be treated nonoperatively with excellent results [ 4 , 5 ] . reported indications for operative management include markedly displaced fractures with compromised skin integrity , open fractures , concomitant vascular injury requiring repair , and compromise of the brachial plexus [ 610 ] . more recently , there has been some support for operative management of middle third fractures with marked displacement or shortening [ 1113 ] . some of these studies have specifically recommended fixation in children and adolescents [ 14 , 15 ] . the aim of this study was to review the outcome of clavicle fractures in paediatric patients at our institute and to determine the number of such fractures that require operative management . we retrospectively reviewed all clavicle fractures in children treated at our institute over a two - year period . we used the agfa impax web1000 system to identify all radiographs of the shoulder region performed in children aged up to and including 15 years old . these radiographs were then reviewed to identify all clavicle fractures in the patient cohort group . medical records and theatre records were then reviewed to establish the classification of each fracture , the treatment method used , the duration of radiographic followup , the duration of clinical followup , and the clinical outcome . exclusion criteria were any patient aged 16 years or older , and any fracture as a result of birth trauma . we identified 487 clavicle fractures in 483 patients treated in our institute during the two - year period . ten neonates were excluded because their injuries were related to birth trauma , and 283 patients were excluded because they were 16 years old or older . all fractures were classified using the system described by robinson [ 16 , table  1 ] . one hundred and twenty - four fractures were undisplaced ( 65% ) and 66 were displaced ( 35% ) . immobilisation in the sling was continued until the patient was comfortable enough to mobilise without support . further radiographs were only taken if the patient continued to have pain or limitation of function when reviewed . initial review was within one week of injury , and second review was at three weeks after initial review . further review appointments were arranged at the discretion of the clinician and were determined by clinical and/or radiographic assessment . the mean radiographic follow - up of the group as a whole was 35 days ( 5 weeks ) , and the mean clinical follow - up was 44 days ( 6.3 weeks ) . the mean radiological and clinical follow - up of the group when subdivided by age can be seen in figures 2 and 3 . forty - four of 190 fractures ( 23% ) had radiographic confirmation of fracture healing . the remaining 77% had radiographic examinations discontinued when clinical symptoms of pain and limitation of function had resolved . all fractures in this study had healed clinically when the child was discharged from follow - up . clavicle fractures are common injuries in general , and , in this study , 39% of all fractures treated over a two - year period involved children of 15 years or younger . despite this , there are surprisingly few published studies that specifically discuss paediatric clavicle fractures . traditionally , clavicle fractures have been treated nonoperatively , particularly in children . this is largely due to the relatively low incidence of complications following non - operative management . indications for operative management in the acute setting have included markedly displaced fractures with compromised skin integrity , open fractures , concomitant vascular injury requiring repair , and compromise of the brachial plexus [ 610 ] . howard and shafer described fourteen clavicle fractures with associated neurovascular complications , but only one case occurred in a child , a ten - year old with a depressed clavicle fracture compressing the subclavian vein . mital and aufranc also described a venous occlusion following a greenstick fracture of the clavicle . keating and von ungern - sternberg recently published a case report entitled  compression of the common carotid artery following clavicle fracture in a twelve - year - old  but the report actually describes a clavicle dislocation . fixation of a clavicle fracture associated with a dislocation [ 19 , 20 ] and fixation of a fracture associated with a sternoclavicular physeal fracture   have also been described in children . operative management for nonunion of a clavicle fracture in a child has also been described . reports of complications of clavicle fractures and operative management of clavicle fractures in paediatric patients are few . the examples cited above demonstrate that complications do occur , but these are extremely rare . in our group of 190 patients , none had significant associated injuries and none required operative management . displaced midshaft fractures of the clavicle have received some attention recently , with some authors recommending operative management . it has been demonstrated that a periosteal hinge is important for fracture stability . in childhood , the periosteal sleeve is thick and protects the cortex , and the bone is softer and more pliable than in adults . in displaced fractures this periosteal sleeve and hinge has been mostly or completely disrupted ( using robinson 's classification , displaced fractures are those that are translated by 100% or more ) . sixty - six patients ( 35% ) in our group sustained displaced fractures of the midclavicle , and all of these healed clinically with non - operative management . this included five fractures that were comminuted segmental ( robinson type 2b2 ) , thereby having almost or complete disruption of the periosteal sleeve in at least one part of the bone . as figure 4 shows , displaced fractures occur more commonly in children as they get older . this can be explained by the more adult type bone and periosteum as the child grows and develops . indeed , figures 3 and 4 demonstrate that the mean period of radiographic and clinical follow - up increased with increasing age of the children . this can in part be attributed to the larger percentage of displaced fractures being encountered with increasing age . in our institute , radiographic evaluation of clavicle fractures is discontinued when symptoms resolve . some authors recommend that torus / buckle fractures do not require any radiographic review whatsoever , as the incidence of complications is so small [ 24 , 25 ] . in our experience , clavicle fractures in children , whether displaced or undisplaced , heal clinically , as demonstrated by the absence of pain and the return of full function . this is achieved at a mean duration of six weeks for all fractures . for all age groups , clinical followup continued for at least as long as radiographic follow - up , and in all cases radiographs were only requested when clinically indicated . some authors have recommended that paediatric patients with clavicle fractures require no follow - up at all . this is based on the fact that most paediatric clavicle fractures heal and is justified by detailed written instructions given to parents informing them of symptoms to be aware of and when to seek further review . the vast majority of patients reviewed in this study lived locally , and all patients are advised to seek further review if they develop symptoms after discharge . patient records were reviewed at a mean of nineteen months after injury . had any of these patients developed late complications within this time period , this would have been documented within their records in the form of referral back to the orthopaedic clinic by their family doctor or the local emergency department . we accept that we still may have overlooked complications in the small number of patients who did not live locally or those whose symptoms were not felt severe enough to warrant further orthopaedic consultation . however , radiographs take time , cost money , and expose patients to radiation [ 2729 ] . we firmly believe that radiographs should only be performed when they are likely to alter the management of the patient . our radiographic follow - up in this study was a mean of five weeks , but we do recognise that only 23% of our patients had fracture union confirmed by radiographs . some studies have suggested that radiographs are not required at all in the assessment of clavicle fractures [ 31 , 32 ] , but we feel that an initial radiograph to confirm and classify the injury is appropriate even where the fracture is obvious clinically . there is evidence in the literature that highlights the aetiology and risk factors for some of these complications . most published articles report these complications in adult patients , and there is a relative paucity of the literature available that is specifically reporting upon clavicle fractures in children . despite this , there are a small number of reports of complications in this group . in our experience , all paediatric clavicle fractures can be treated with simple immobilisation and analgesia , without development of complications . radiographic review of paediatric clavicle fractures is unnecessary in the absence of clinical findings suggestive of delayed union .","paediatric clavicle fractures have traditionally been treated nonoperatively . 
 recent studies have recommended operative management for displaced midshaft fractures . 
 we conducted a retrospective review of all clavicle fractures in children aged one to sixteen over a two - year period . 
 we classified fractures and evaluated followup and clinical outcome . 
 we identified 190 fractures . 
 there were 135 boys and 55 girls . 
 65% of fractures were displaced and 35% undisplaced . 
 mean radiographic and clinical followup was 35 days and 44 days , respectively . 
 clavicle fractures in children heal with nonoperative management . 
 radiographs of clavicle fractures in children are unnecessary in the absence of clinical symptoms .",144
"aldehyde oxidases ( ec 1.2.3.1 ) are proteins belonging to the family of molybdo- and tungsten - enzymes , which is represented in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes . in mammals , no tungsten - containing proteins are known , while three other types of molybdo - enzymes , besides aldehyde oxidases -- that is , xanthine oxidoreductase ( xor ) , sulphite oxidase ( so ) and the recently discovered mitochondrial amidoxime reductase component ( marc ) -- have been described . mammalian catalytically active molybdo - enzymes require a specific form of organic molybdenum , known as the molybdenum cofactor ( moco ) . unlike that observed in so and marc , the holo - enzymatic forms of aldehyde oxidases and xors contain a sulphurated species of moco [ 3 - 5 ] . aldehyde oxidases and xors are further sub - classified as molybdo - flavoenzymes ( mfes ) , if they require flavin adenine dinucleotide ( fad ) as a cofactor . both enzymes are homodimers , with each subunit ( approximately 150 kda ) consisting of three distinct domains . the 25 kda amino- terminal domain contains two non - identical iron / sulphur clusters , the 40 kda intermediate domain consists of the fad - binding region , while the 85 kda carboxy - terminal domain is characterised by the presence of the substrate - binding pocket , which lies in close proximity to the moco site . one of the main differences between aldehyde oxidases and xors is represented by a nadbinding site , which is absent in aldehyde oxidases . xors , in their dehydrogenase form , transfer the reducing equivalents generated by the oxidation of the substrate to nad . by contrast , aldehyde oxidases   and xors , in their oxidase form , use molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor , producing hydrogen peroxide . the similarity between aldehyde oxidases and xors is not limited to their general characteristics , and extends to the primary structure . the overall amino acid identity between aldehyde oxidases and xors from the same animal species is approximately 40 per cent . in addition , the primary structures of plant , insect and vertebrate aldehyde oxidases show a remarkable degree of similarity to xors of bacterial origin . this is in line with the idea that the two enzymes are evolutionarily conserved and originated through at least two asynchronous duplication events of the corresponding genes . some years ago , it was believed that the family of mammalian mfes consisted of only two members -- xor and a single aldehyde oxidase ( annotated in the national center for biotechnology information [ ncbi ] database as aox1 ) . the first complete amino acid sequence of a mammalian aldehyde oxidase was deduced from the molecular cloning of the corresponding bovine cdna in our laboratory . based on the high level of amino acid similarity , it soon became apparent to us that this sequence corresponded to a human cdna that had been originally identified as xor . the first hint of the presence of multiple aldehyde oxidases in certain animal species came from an early analysis of the limited number of mouse expressed sequence tags ( ests ) available in the ncbi database . this allowed us to identify and isolate two other mouse cdnas   encoding catalytically active proteins highly related to bovine , mouse and rat aox1 , the primary structure of which had been elucidated in the meantime [ 16 - 18 ] . in a subsequent study , we identified a fourth murine functional enzyme and demonstrated that rats are characterised by the same complement of four aldehyde oxidases as mice . each novel rodent aldehyde oxidase was shown to be the product of distinct loci , mapping with the original aox1 orthologous genes to a small region ( approximately 350 kilobases ) of mouse chromosome 1 and rat chromosome 9 . the three novel proteins present in rodents were named aldehyde oxidase homologues 1 , 2 and 3 ( aoh1 , aoh2 and aoh3 ) , and the corresponding genes were referred to as aoh1 , aoh2 and aoh3 , respectively . the current nomenclature adopted by the ncbi is different , as aoh1 is referred to as aox3 , while aoh2 and aoh3 have been renamed aox4 and aox3l1 , respectively ( table 1 ) . we will conform to this nomenclature throughout the paper , and refer to the various aldehyde oxidases present in different mammalian species as aox1 , aox3 , aox4 and aox3l1 . the term ' aldehyde oxidase(s ) ' will be used in a general sense , whenever no distinction between the various isoforms of the family is meant . the accession numbers of the proteins or predicted translation products of the corresponding genes present in the genbank or ensembl databases are indicated in the rightmost column . the official or proposed gene symbol ( ' gene symbol ' ) along with the acronym originally suggested in our previous references ( ' our original symbol ' ) are also indicated . * at present , it is unclear whether macaca mulatta aox4 is a functional gene or a pseudogene . the dendrogram shown in figure 1 summarises our current knowledge of the phylogenesis of aldehyde oxidases . the primary structure of these proteins is relatively well conserved throughout evolution , and the most primitive organism showing evidence for one such enzyme is the flat worm , caenorhabditis elegans . a rooted dendrogram was obtained by the phylip method after clustal - w computer - aided alignment of the indicated proteins . poere aox1 = poecilia reticulata ( guppy ) aox1 ; coeel aox1/aox2 = caenorhabditis elegans aox1 and aox2 ; drome aox1/aox2/aox3/aox4 = drosophila melanogaster aox1 , aox2 , aox3 and aox4 ; arath aox1/aox2/aox3/aox4 = arabidopsis thaliana aox1 , aox2 , aox3 and aox4 ; lyces aox1/aox2/aox3 = lycopersicon esculentum ( tomato ) aox1 , aox2 and aox3 ; zeama aox1/aox2 = zea mays aox1 and aox2 ; xenla aox1 = xenopus laevis aox1 ; gorgo aox1 = gorilla gorilla aox1 . bona fide aldehyde oxidase homologous proteins do not seem to be represented in prokaryotes , although many molybdenum and tungsten enzymes with low levels of amino acid similarity to vertebrate aldehyde oxidases are known ( eg see blase ' et al . ) . this is at variance with what has been observed for xor , the ancestors of which can be easily traced back to prokaryotes and very primitive eukaryotes , like aspergillus nidulans . as already discussed , aldehyde oxidases and xors are highly related proteins and have a common origin . aldehyde oxidases are indeed the products of duplication events from an ancestral eukaryotic xor gene ; however , two structurally different families of aldehyde oxidases can be recognised on the basis of the amino acid sequences ( figure 1 ) . a first cluster consists of nematode , insect and plant enzymes , while a second group contains all vertebrate aldehyde oxidases . vertebrate aldehyde oxidases are closer to xors than to aldehyde oxidases from more primitive animals and plants . this finding is suggestive of two separate and evolutionarily divergent duplication events from an ancestral xor gene . the first event produced the aldehyde oxidase precursor to worm , insect and plant enzymes . this is supported by the intron / exon structure of all the vertebrate aldehyde oxidase and xor genes , which are strikingly conserved and much more complex than those of homologues from the lower eukaryotes and plants . the two original duplications were followed by a number of other such events that led to the extant complement of aldehyde oxidase genes in the plant and animal kingdoms . the evolution of vertebrate aldehyde oxidases ( figure 2 ) is characterised by a first phase of asynchronous gene multiplication events , which started in certain birds . fishes ( danio rerio ) and amphibians ( xenopus laevis ) are endowed with a single functional aldehyde oxidase gene . the figure contains a schematic representation of the aldehyde oxidase genes in selected vertebrates for which complete or almost complete genomic sequence data are available . the chromosomal location is indicated on the right ( nd , not determined ) . whenever the structure of the gene is predicted solely on the basis of the genomic sequence , and the corresponding cdnas have not been characterised , the genbank locus number ( loc ) is indicated . at present , it is unclear whether macaca mulatta aox4 is a functional gene or a pseudogene . the corresponding gene products show the highest level of amino acid identity to the rodent aox1 isoenzyme , supporting an orthologous relationship . d. rerio or x. laevis aox1 has the conserved 35/36 exon structure typical of all vertebrate aldehyde oxidase genes . in addition , fish aox1 and xor map to different chromosomes , which is also characteristic of all vertebrates except primates . some avians ( chicken ) show evidence of a gene duplication event involving aox1 and resulting in the production of a new synthenic gene ( on chromosome 7 ) , which we named aldehyde oxidase homologue ( aoh ) . aoh is characterised by an identical exon / intron structure , with perfect conservation of exon / intron junctions along the coding sequence . the amino acid sequences of chicken aox1 and aoh protein products are approximately 60 per cent identical and only more distantly related to the corresponding xor enzyme ( 40 per cent identity ) . the presence of two aldehyde oxidase genes in birds does not seem to be a general phenomenon . in fact , a blast search indicates that the zebra finch , taeniopygia guttata , has a single aox1 locus on chromosome 7 ( table 1 and figure 2 ) . moving up along the evolutionary ladder to marsupials ( monodelphis domestica , opossum ) , the exon - intron structure of all the genes is strictly conserved , indicative of two further gene duplication events . three of the loci ( aox1 , aox3 and aox4 ) map to chromosome 1 , whereas the fourth gene ( aox3l1 ) is located on chromosome 7 . the genes identified in m. domestica are the orthologues of the four loci present in rodents ( mouse and rats ) . the evolutionary process of the aldehyde oxidase gene cluster in mammals is characterised by a sudden and species - specific shift from multiplication to suppression / deletion . bos taurus ( cow ) seems to have maintained three active aldehyde oxidase genes ( aox1 , aox4 and aox3l1 ) on chromosome 2 . the absence of nucleotide sequences with similarity to aox3 strongly suggests that this gene has been deleted . deletion of the aox3 gene seems to be a conserved feature in another herbivore , the horse , although our present view of the aldehyde oxidase cluster in this animal species is still incomplete . the genome of dogs is characterised by two seemingly active aox4 and aox3l1 loci and two inactive aox1 and aox3 pseudogenes clustering on chromosome 37 . the vestiges of numerous exons with nucleotide similarity to the rodent aox1 and aox3 genes are easily identified on two separate regions slightly upstream of the dog aox4 and aox3l1 loci . it is interesting to notice that the dog is currently the only mammalian species that seems to be lacking aox1 , in addition to aox4 . this observation has important implications , as this mammal is devoid of aldehyde oxidase activity in the liver . humans are endowed with a single functional aldehyde oxidase gene , namely aox1 , consisting of the canonical 35 conserved coding exons . this is the result of the persistence of the aox3 deletion and the simultaneous transformation of aox4 and aox3l1 into inactive , albeit transcribed , pseudogenes . aox1 and the two pseudogenes map to a short segment on chromosome 2q . functional inactivation of the aox4 and aox3l1 genes occurred before the appearance of the human species , as chimpanzees ( pan troglodytes ) are endowed with the same complement of aldehyde oxidase genes and pseudogenes as humans . functional suppression of aox4 and aox3l1 seems to be the result of two recent , distinct and asynchronous events , based on the results obtained in the old - world monkeys ( macaca fascicularis and macaca mulatta ) . in fact , the genomes of these monkeys seem to contain two functional ( aox1 and aox3l1 ) as well as one or two inactive ( aox3 and aox4 ) pseudogenes clustering on chromosome 12 ( m. terao , unpublished result ) . in summary , two phylogenetically distinct branches of the evolutionary process led to the extant complement of worm / insect / plant and vertebrate aldehyde oxidases through an equivalent number of primitive and distinct gene duplication events involving the xor ancestor . these initial events were followed by a divergent series of species - specific and more recent gene multiplication events that occurred not only in vertebrates but also in plants , worms and insects . maize , tomato and arabidopsis thaliana are respectively characterised by two , three and four structurally very similar aldehyde oxidase genes . similarly , the flatworm , c. elegans , and the fruitfly , drosophila melanogaster , are endowed , respectively , with two and four aldehyde oxidases . the most ancient member of the vertebrate aldehyde oxidase family is aox1 . , the evolutionary order of appearance of aox3 , aox4 and aox3l1 is unknown ; however , a number of considerations led us to propose that aox4 is more ancient than aox3 , which , in turn , appeared earlier than aox3l1 . the data available on the tissue distribution of human aox1 are limited [ 23 - 25 ] . the richest source of the enzyme is the liver , however , where aox1 serves an important role in the metabolism of xenobiotics . aox1 is also present in the respiratory system , where it can be identified in the epithelial cells lining the trachea and bronchi , as well as in the alveolar cells of the lung . in the digestive system , the kidney is another source of aox1 , with synthesis of the protein occurring in the proximal distal and collecting tubules . finally , the prostate and adrenal glands seem to contain detectable amounts of the protein . the localisation of aox1 in the central nervous system is largely unknown , although it was reported that the corresponding transcript is expressed in the glial component of the anterior horns of the spinal cord . in general , the tissue distributions of aox1 in humans and baboons , the only other primate for which studies are available , are concordant , particularly in relation to the presence of the enzyme in the livers and the respiratory systems . two mouse aldehyde oxidases ( aox1 and aox3 ) have an overlapping tissue distribution , which is largely superimposable with that of human aox1 . while this is expected in the case of aox1 , given its orthologous relationship with the human enzyme , the observation is important in the case of aox3 . by far the richest source of the two enzymes is the liver , where aox1 and aox3 are present exclusively in the cytosolic fraction of the hepatocyte compartment . different mouse strains are characterised by different relative amounts of the two hepatic enzymes , however . high levels of aox3 and much lower levels of aox1 are present in the outbred cd1 and the inbred c57bl/6j strains . by contrast , the two inbred strains dba/2 and cba have an almost complete deficit of expression of aox3 . this deficit is the result of epigenetic silencing of the corresponding gene by methylation of the regulatory sequences . significant expression of both aox1 and aox3 is observed also in the lung , which is the second richest source . limited amounts of aox1 and aox3 are also believed to be present in the central nervous system , on the basis of in situ hybridisation experiments http://www.brainatlas.org / aba/. expression is limited to the choroid plexus , which is the organ devoted to the production and re - absorption of the cephalorachidian fluid , and the motor neuronal cell population in the brain and spinal cord . while cellular co - localisation of aox3 in the choroid plexus is clear , similar evidence is not available for the motor neurones . low levels of aox1 and/or aox3 are also inferred from the expression data available in the online mendelian inheritance in man ( omim ) section of the ncbi website http://http./www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. of particular interest is the presence of aox1 in the skin ( which was recently confirmed ) , the mammary gland and the genitourinary tract . the richest source of aox4 is the harderian gland , a prominent intra - orbital exocrine gland involved in diverse homeostatic functions , such as thermoregulation , lubrication of the eye surface , control of pheromonal cues and regulation of the circadian rhythm [ 30 - 32 ] . the gland is present in various vertebrate species , but is absent in humans and primates . far lower amounts of aox4 have also been identified in the epidermal layer of the skin and the keratinised epithelia lining the oral cavity , oesophagus and proximal portion of the stomach . in the skin , the epidermis is not the only structure containing aox4 , as sebaceous glands are also enriched in the corresponding mrna . interestingly , sebaceous and harderian glands share common characteristics , producing a lipid - rich secretion , which is involved in thermoregulation and pheromone release . finally , aox3l1 is unique , being limited to the secretory cells of the bowman 's gland , the most important exocrine gland of the olfactory mucosa . these structures are present in all vertebrates , including humans , with the exception of fish . the serous / mucous product of bowman 's glands is important in shaping the microenvironment necessary for a proper stimulation of the nasal neuroepithelium by odorants . bowman 's glands are so rich in aox3l1 that they were used as the source for the purification of the enzyme to homogeneity . most of the literature on aldehyde oxidases has focused on this aspect of their biology [ 33 - 38 ] . all the members of the family are characterised by broad substrate specificity , oxidising numerous types of molecule . in spite of their name , aldehyde oxidases catalyse not only the oxidation of aldehydes into the corresponding carboxylic acid , but they also hydroxylate n - heterocyclic molecules with high efficiency . human aox1 and rodent aox1/aox3 may actually represent the major cytosolic enzymes metabolising xenobiotics in the liver . the enzymes are involved in the phase i metabolism of numerous compounds of both medical and toxicological relevance , potentially acting in concert with the microsomal cytochrome p450 system [ 33 - 39 ] . extensive discussion of the compounds metabolised by human or rodent aldehyde oxidases is beyond the scope of this paper , and the reader is referred to specific reviews for more details . it is worth mentioning that aldehyde oxidases have an important role in the metabolism of the anti - tumour and immunosuppressive agents , methotrexate , 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine , and aldophosphamide , the active metabolite of cyclophosphamide . aldehyde oxidases have also been reported to metabolise the antimalarial agent , quinine   and the anti - viral drug famcyclovir . finally , human aox1 is known to cause the inactivation of the hypnotic , zaleplon . as evident from this short and incomplete list , the drug metabolising activity of aldehyde oxidases is predominantly related to the ability of these enzymes to hydroxylate n - heterocyclic rings . from a toxicological perspective , the aldehyde oxidase activity present in mammalian liver has been reported to play a major role in the oxidation of environmental pollutants such as phthalazines . by contrast , it is unlikely that mouse aox1 and aox3 are of any relevance for the oxidation of the ethanol metabolite , acetaldehyde , into acetic acid . although a wealth of data are available on exogenous substrates , endogenous substrates of aldehyde oxidases are still being sought . the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg , http://www.kegg.jp ) contains a number of metabolic pathways listing potential physiological substrates of aldehyde oxidases , such as the serotonin metabolite , 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde ( pathway : ko00380 ) , and the amino acid catabolites ( s)-methylmalonate semi - aldehyde ( pathway : ko00280 ) and gentisate aldehyde ( pathway : ko00350 ) . at present , however , there is no direct evidence of the significance of human aox1 or any of the other mammalian homologues in the oxidation of these substrates . aldehyde oxidases are also purported to play a role in the metabolism of vitamins b3 ( nicotinamide ) , b6 ( pyridoxal phosphate ) and a ( retinol ) . the vitamin b3 metabolite , n1-methylnicotinamide is a good substrate for semi - purified human and monkey aox1 preparations . pyridoxal , the vitamin b6 precursor , is oxidised to 4-pyridoxic acid by the human enzyme   and by the two mouse liver aldehyde oxidases , aox1 and aox3 ( terao m. , unpublished results ) . pyridoxal is currently the sole example of a substrate that shows a certain degree of selectivity for a specific aldehyde oxidase protein as it is not recognised by purified mouse aox4 . vitamin a metabolism is probably the endogenous pathway for which more stringent information on the involvement of aldehyde oxidases is available . the ability of mammalian aldehyde oxidases to catalyse the oxidation of retinaldehyde ( a physiological precursor ) into retinoic acid ( the active metabolite of vitamin a ) was discovered in rabbit liver cytosol   and confirmed using purified preparations of mouse liver aox1 . in our hands , retinaldehyde has been one of the best substrates not only of mouse aox1 , but also of aox3 , aox4 and aox3l1 . the km and vmax measured for the purified forms of aox1 , aox3 and aox4 compare well   with the same parameters reported for the three aldehyde dehydrogenases , aldh1a1 , aldh1a2 and aldh1a3 , which have long been known to catalyse the oxidation of retinaldehyde and to play a critical role in the morphogenetic activity of retinoic acid during the development of the vertebrate embryo . support for the relevance of aox4 for the local synthesis and accumulation of retinoic acid in the harderian gland has recently been provided by the phenotypic , genetic and biochemical characterisation of the first aldehyde oxidase knockout mouse to be generated . although a substantial amount of information on the structure and evolution of mammalian aldehyde oxidases is available , little is known about the physiological function of these enzymes in mammals , with particular reference to humans and relevant animal models . progress in establishing the significance of this class of enzymes for the homeostasis of the mammalian organism is clearly a priority . to this end , it will be necessary to identify the endogenous substrate(s ) of human aox1 and all the other mammalian isoenzymes . this is likely to require an integrated approach based on the definition of the substrate(s ) using purified enzyme preparations , and validation of the results in vivo . it is envisaged that in vivo studies in humans will require the measurement of relevant molecules in biological fluids , using cohorts of individuals genotyped for the presence of aox1 allelic variants with alterations in the catalytic activity of the corresponding protein products . it will therefore be important to increase the number of population studies   designed to discover new aox1 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) ( see , for instance , our reference rs41309768 , in the single nucleotide polymorphism database [ dbsnp ] section of the ncbi database ) . similar studies will also have to be performed in experimental animals , with the caveat that mice and rats are characterised by the presence of multiple aldehyde oxidase forms , as discussed above . in this context , strains of mice characterised by a different profile of aldehyde oxidases , as well as specific knockout animals , will represent useful tools to this end . uplc / q - tof - ms / ms , followed by chemometrics and analysis of principle components , would very likely identify one or more metabolic pathways that are perturbed in the absence of each one of the mouse aox enzymes . association studies aimed at defining the relevance of aox1 for the aetio - pathogenesis and progression of specific human diseases are also needed , as they may provide insights into the functional significance of the enzyme . these studies will integrate the knowledge that is likely to be generated from the phenotypic analysis of the genetically engineered mice that are already available or will be available in the near future . along these lines , our studies on the aox4 knockout mouse have already provided evidence that the corresponding protein is involved in the control of skin homeostasis and in the postnatal development of the harderian gland . whether the two phenomena are linked to a decrease in the local metabolism of retinaldehyde to retinoic further knowledge is likely to be gained soon by phenotypic analysis of the newly generated aox3l1 knockout animal ( m. terao , unpublished results ) . nevertheless , the data already gathered strongly suggest that the various aldehyde oxidases are unlikely to play a vital function in the homeostasis of the mouse , as both types of knockout animal develop normally and are fertile . three final considerations are worth making . the first two concern , again , the basic problem of the physiological significance of aldehyde oxidases . in this regard , a key point relates to the reason(s ) why the evolution of vertebrate organisms is associated with a first wave of multiplication and a subsequent phase of deletion / suppression of the aldehyde oxidase genes . these phenomena are likely to be related to the necessity for developing specific and possibly tissue - related functions in certain animal species , which must have become dispensable in humans and primates . the idea is readily acceptable for an enzyme like aox4 , which is highly enriched in the harderian gland , as the structure is absent in humans and primates . it may be also viable in the case of aox3l1 , if the protein serves a function in the recognition of odorants . indeed , it is well known that olfaction is much more developed and sophisticated in rodents than in humans . the presence of an extra enzyme ( aox3 ) in the liver of the mouse , relative to the human , is more complicated to explain . nevertheless , in generating hypotheses as to the real function of the various aldehyde oxidases , an open mind should be always kept , since the function of these proteins may not necessarily be related to their enzymatic activity . the third consideration is of a more practical nature and is relevant for the role exerted by aldehyde oxidases in drug metabolism . with respect to this , it is clear from what has been reported here that caution should be exercised in using rodents , dogs and possibly rhesus monkeys as good proxies for the human situation . this work was made possible by unrestricted grants from the fondazione monzino , the associazione italian per la ricerca contro il cancro ( airc ) and the fondo di investimento per la ricerca di base ( firb ) . we would also like to thank mr f. deceglie and mr a. soave for the artwork .","aldehyde oxidases ( ec 1.2.3.1 ) are a small group of structurally conserved cytosolic proteins represented in both the animal and plant kingdoms . in vertebrates , 
 aldehyde oxidases constitute the small sub - family of molybdo - flavoenzymes , along with the evolutionarily and structurally related protein , xanthine oxidoreductase . 
 these enzymes require a molybdo - pterin cofactor ( molybdenum cofactor , moco ) and flavin adenine dinucleotide for their catalytic activity . 
 aldehyde oxidases have broad substrate specificity and catalyse the hydroxylation of n - heterocycles and the oxidation of aldehydes to the corresponding acid . in humans , a single aldehyde oxidase gene ( aox1 ) and 
 two pseudogenes clustering on a short stretch of chromosome 2q are known . in other mammals , 
 a variable number of structurally conserved aldehyde oxidase genes has been described . 
 four genes ( aox1 , aox3 , aox4 and aox3l1 ) , coding for an equivalent number of catalytically active enzymes , are present in the mouse and rat genomes . although human aox1 and its homologous proteins are best known as drug metabolising enzymes , the physiological substrate(s ) and function(s ) 
 are as yet unknown . 
 the present paper provides an update of the available information on the evolutionary history , tissue- and cell - specific distribution and function of mammalian aldehyde oxidases .",317
"all of the effects of antimicrobial agents against microbes , including the delineation of microbial resistance , are based upon the results of in vitro susceptibility testing . most of these susceptibility tests only measure bacteriostatic activity even though the agent being tested may have bactericidal activity . these authors point out the paucity of studies that have critically evaluated the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy with results of in vitro susceptibility tests . such critical evaluations are not easily done , as susceptibility tests do not take into account the normal host defense mechanisms . however , the detection of resistance is somewhat predictive of poor outcome , although in the normal host this may be less clinically important due to the interaction of host defenses ( 17,18 ) . the ability of bactericidal activity to influence therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcome has been evaluated in infections that typically are refractory to antimicrobial therapy . these infections include endocarditis , meningitis , osteomyelitis , and infections in the neutropenic host . all are similar in that antimicrobial penetration and host defense mechanisms at the site of infection are limited . both experimental models of infection ( 1922 ) and clinical studies ( 2327 ) have shown that bactericidal activity predicts therapeutic efficacy and results in improved clinical outcome . bactericidal activity has been considered less important in respiratory tract infections , with the exception being acute infectious exacerbations in cystic fibrosis ( 28 ) . however , the relevance of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics in the selection of antibiotics for respiratory tract infection has become increasingly recognized ( 29 ) . issues such as drug concentration at the site of infection , bactericidal activity , postantibiotic effect , and duration of therapy needed to achieve these effects are now being considered when antimicrobial agents are selected for the therapy of respiratory tract infections ( 29,30 ) . although host factors may allow a bacteriostatic agent to be used successfully in an infected patient , these factors appear to be less able to curtail the emergence of resistance . resistance , as a rule , occurs more rapidly with bacteriostatic agents such as tetracyclines , sulfonamides , and macrolides than it does with bactericidal agents such as beta - lactams and aminoglycosides ( 3133 ) . beta - lactam agents have been the antimicrobial agents of choice for the therapy of pneumococcal pneumonia since penicillin was first clinically introduced in the 1940s ( 17 ) . the emergence of macrolide resistance in s. pneumoniae has been rapid in comparison and has even been described during treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia ( 34 ) . bactericidal activity thus may be useful in the therapy of respiratory tract infections as a means to curtail , but not avoid , the emergence of resistance . the key to resolving the problem of antibacterial resistance lies in identifying the mechanisms that engender it ( 3133 ) . among the most important mechanisms are decreased ability of antibacterials to penetrate the bacterial cell wall , active efflux of antibacterial agents , inactivation of antibacterial agents , destruction of antibacterial agents , alteration of antibacterial target sites , development of bypass pathways around antibacterial targets , and constitutive phenotypic variation in bacterial physiology . subsequent exposure of the microorganism to a specific agent may then select the mutant , leading to the emergence of resistance . some resistance mechanisms , such as bacterial production of beta - lactamase , are inducible or can be derepressed ( 35 ) , requiring either upregulation or mutation of genetic material . thus , if resistance is to be suppressed , the opportunity for bacterial upregulation or mutation of genetic material must be minimized . one way to minimize upregulation , mutation , or both is by using bactericidal rather than merely bacteriostatic agents . microorganisms inhibited by a bacteriostatic agent or exposed to an insufficient concentration of a bactericidal agent remain alive and , ipso facto , retain the potential to become resistant or promulgate any resistance selected by the exposure to the antimicrobial agent . an example of this principle can be seen with the upper respiratory tract pathogen , streptococcus pyogenes , which to date has not developed resistance to penicillin , a bactericidal agent , but has developed resistance to erythromycin , a bacteriostatic agent ( 3638 ) . erythromycin resistance in s. pyogenes largely is due to upregulation of efflux ( 36 ) or to ribosomal mutation ( 37 ) . antimicrobial agents that kill this pathogen should be less likely to promulgate any strains having such resistance . another example is seen with the omp genes of gram - negative microorganisms . these omp genes encode porins that are sometimes flanked by insertion sequences . in the presence of the bacteriostatic agent , the mobility of insertion sequence  flanking omp genes can be attenuated and will result in disruption of the omp genes . the reduced expression of these porins may lead to reduced uptake of the inducer , the antibacterial agent . specifically , insertion sequence interruption of the ompk36 porin gene in respiratory tract pathogen klebsiella pneumoniae has been shown to interfere in the expression of this porin gene and has resulted in clinical failure ( 39 ) . if a bactericidal agent kills a pathogen such as klebsiella before mutation of the porin gene , resistance is less likely to develop . these two examples illustrate the desirability of achieving bactericidal activity to curtail the emergence of resistance . bactericidal activity can be achieved through the mechanism of action for a single antimicrobial agent or by the use of combination therapy , or both . sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim ( smx - tmp ) is an example of a combination of two agents , each of which alone is bacteriostatic , that achieves bactericidal activity . sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase , the bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of p - aminobenzoid acid into dihydropteroic acid , the immediate precursor of folic acid , while trimethoprim was specifically synthesized as an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase ( 40 ) . smx - tmp has long been used for the therapy of respiratory tract infection ( 41 ) and has proven particularly useful in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis . in fact , the world health organization continues to be recommend smx - tmp as the first - line treatment for pneumonia in children because of its low cost and ease of dosing . resistance to smx - tmp has emerged more slowly than for either agent used alone ( 42 ) . however , emergence of resistance to s. pneumoniae has occurred ( 43 ) and now may limit the use of smx - tmp in respiratory tract infections . combinations of antimicrobial agents are also used in the therapy of bacterial endocarditis to achieve synergism leading to increased bactericidal activity and improved sterilization of infected valves . bactericidal synergy for s. epidermidis can be demonstrated in vitro for the combination of vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin , which correlates well with the therapeutic results in an experimental animal model ( 44 ) . in a comparable clinical study of patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by staphylococcus epidermidis , 90% were cured with a combination of vancomycin , rifampin , and/or gentamicin , compared with only 50% cured among those receiving vancomycin alone ( 45 ) . combination therapy for respiratory tract infections is less well studied except for acute respiratory tract infections occurring in cystic fibrosis patients . for example , combination therapy for treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis patients achieved a cure rate of 89% if peak serum bactericidal titers were > 1:128 ( 28 ) . in contrast , 100% of patients failed therapy if their peak serum bactericidal titers were < 1:16 . other examples of the importance of bactericidal activity are the fluoroquinolones . studies of the bactericidal action of the quinolones against escherichia coli demonstrate at least two independent and important mechanisms of action . these bactericidal agents are only effective if the bacteria are actively dividing or synthesizing proteins and mrna . the bactericidal activity of the quinolone nalidixic acid , for example , is minimized by chloramphenicol , which prevents protein synthesis , and by rifampin , which prevents rna synthesis . however , ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin / levofloxacin respond differently . although the bactericidal action of these fluoroquinolones against e. coli is reduced , bactericidal action is not entirely eliminated by chloramphenicol or rifampin . this lack of elimination of bactericidal action suggests that these agents possess a secondary bactericidal mechanism of action that does not depend on the synthesis of protein and rna , and that may be active when the bacteria are in a nonreplicating state ( 46 ) . to understand this secondary bactericidal effect , consisting of approximately 20 genes , this system repairs structural damage to dna caused by antibacterial agents , mainly through bypass repair ( 4650 ) . another effect of the sos response , activated by fluoroquinolone - induced damage to the bacterial dna , is the discontinuation of cell replication . in addition to high concentrations of fluoroquinolone , which trigger the secondary bactericidal mechanism , higher concentrations at dna targets also play a role in the emergence of resistance because the postantibiotic effect of the fluoroquinolones is dependent upon concentration , time , and the microorganism . if the concentration of fluoroquinolone attained at the bacterial dna targets is high enough to activate the sos system for a duration that exceeds the capability of the particular microorganism to repair its dna damage and replicate , the microorganism dies . if the fluoroquinolone concentration is not adequate , however , a race occurs between cumulative damage over time and the selection of a resistant mutant . the concentration of fluoroquinolone required for sos - mediated discontinuation of cell replication is expressed as a peak concentration / minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) ratio and appears to require a ratio of approximately 10:1 ( 50,51 ) . a rat model for pseudomonas sepsis demonstrated that peak concentration / mic ratios > 20:1 once per day produced significantly ( p<0.5 ) better survival  which may result in the selection of a mutant with altered topoisomerase  than did regimens using the same dosage on a more fractionated schedule ( 52 ) . dosages that led to peak concentration / mic ratios < 10 times the mic did not result in as high a survival rate . indeed , when the peak concentration / mic ratio was < 10 times the mic , the best survival was predicted by the area under the curve / mic ratio , since repeated exposure to the fluoroquinolone causes damage cumulatively . the length of time that fluoroquinolone levels in plasma exceeded the mic had no influence on survival . the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance with respect to staphylococcus aureus and p. aeruginosa has been well - documented ( 53 ) . this major problem is due to a wide variety of fluoroquinolone - resistance mechanisms ( 54,55 ) , particularly the mutation of dna gyrase ( 56 ) . while this type of resistance generally results in mics only four- to eight - fold higher than the susceptible isolate , recent studies have reported the development of high - level resistance ( e.g. , ciprofloxacin mic for p. aeruginosa of 1,024 mg / l ) mediated by efflux pumps targeting multiple antibacterial agents ( 57,58 ) . these multidrug efflux pumps could be overcome by high fluoroquinolone concentrations , some of which , however , would not be clinically achievable . a rabbit meningitis model further demonstrates how the inability to achieve peak concentration / mic ratios > 10:1 influences the postantibiotic effect . in an in vivo study , an exposure to ciprofloxacin at the mic had minimal impact ( 59 ) , underscoring the value of bactericidal activity with respect to fluoroquinolone therapy . the greater the activity of the fluoroquinolone , the more likely the agent will achieve serum or tissue levels that are > 10 times the mic , which in turn determines the secondary bactericidal and postantibiotic effects . consequently , newer fluoroquinolones such as gemifloxacin ( 60 ) and others now under development have markedly increased activity compared with traditional agents . for example , ciprofloxacin has mics against streptococcus pneumoniae of approximately 0.5 mg / l , while gemifloxacin has mics of approximately 0.03 mg / l . an important issue associated with the use of fluoroquinolones in the therapy of respiratory tract infections is the fact that fluoroquinolones also are used to treat other infections . the use of these agents for other infections means that the population already had been exposed to fluoroquinolones before their widespread use in respiratory tract infections . exposure of normal flora in these patients to subbactericidal concentrations of fluoroquinolones may allow resistant strains to emerge . cross - resistance is a well - recognized problem with fluoroquinolones ( 55 ) , and the enormous prior exposure of the population to these agents may have created resistant strains in the normal flora of the mucosal surfaces , skin , gastrointestinal tract , and reproductive tract . in addition , prior exposure may result in increasing mics due to subtle mutations of topoisomerases , which then may leave the microorganism only one step from a mutation that will produce overt resistance ( 55 ) . an example of such subtle topoisomerase mutation is seen with fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin , which have been recommended and widely used for the therapy of pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance to s. pneumoniae is a problem ( 61 ) . unfortunately , the population has had considerable prior exposure to earlier fluoroquinolones , which has allowed rapid emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in s. pneumoniae ( 62 ) . failure of treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia due to resistance to levofloxacin recently has been described ( 63 ) . this example confirms the problem of cross - resistance and further mutations resulting in increased resistance and suggests that newer fluoroquinolones such as gemifloxacin may be less effective or even ineffective against s. pneumoniae . other examples of the importance of bactericidal activity are the fluoroquinolones . studies of the bactericidal action of the quinolones against escherichia coli demonstrate at least two independent and important mechanisms of action . these bactericidal agents are only effective if the bacteria are actively dividing or synthesizing proteins and mrna . the bactericidal activity of the quinolone nalidixic acid , for example , is minimized by chloramphenicol , which prevents protein synthesis , and by rifampin , which prevents rna synthesis . however , ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin / levofloxacin respond differently . although the bactericidal action of these fluoroquinolones against e. coli is reduced , bactericidal action is not entirely eliminated by chloramphenicol or rifampin . this lack of elimination of bactericidal action suggests that these agents possess a secondary bactericidal mechanism of action that does not depend on the synthesis of protein and rna , and that may be active when the bacteria are in a nonreplicating state ( 46 ) . to understand this secondary bactericidal effect , consisting of approximately 20 genes , this system repairs structural damage to dna caused by antibacterial agents , mainly through bypass repair ( 4650 ) . another effect of the sos response , activated by fluoroquinolone -

resistance and further mutations resulting in increased resistance and suggests that newer fluoroquinolones such as gemifloxacin may be less effective or even ineffective against s. pneumoniae . the term macrolide was originally applied to specific compounds produced by various streptomyces species containing , as part of their structure , a macrocyclic lactone to which various deoxy sugars are attached . these bacteriostatic compounds bind to bacterial 50s ribosomes , inhibiting protein synthesis without a concomitant inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis . the classification has since been modified to include other structurally diverse agents , such as lincosamides and streptogramins , which are also produced by streptomyces species and target the 50s ribosome . the term mls ( macrolide , lincosamide , and streptogramin ) has become the accepted nomenclature for this important group of antibacterial agents  except when the emphasis is on structural similarity , in which case the erythromycin congeners ( erythromycin - a , clarithromycin , and azithromycin ) are often referred to as the  true macrolides  ( 64 ) . although antibacterial agents in the mls class have been largely bacteriostatic , newer members demonstrate bactericidal activity . these new agents include quinupristin / dalfopristin and telithromycin . the bactericidal mechanism of action of quinupristin / dalfopristin , a combination of two streptogramins , is unique ( 65 ) . dalfopristin is an olefinic macrolactone that binds to the 50s subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome and interferes with the function of peptidyl transferase , thereby inactivating the donor and acceptor sites of the ribosome . in addition , dalfopristin triggers a conformational change in the ribosome that greatly increases the affinity of quinupristin , a peptidic macrolactone , which also binds to the 50s subunit of the ribosome and halts peptide chain elongation . consequently , protein synthesis is not only halted transiently by either component used alone but also halted permanently by the two components in combination , resulting in synergistic and concentration - independent bactericidal activity against many pathogens . this binding of both macrolactones distinguishes quinupristin / dalfopristin from other antibiotic classes ( 66,67 ) , with the attendant prolongation of the postantibiotic effect ( 68 ) representing a distinct advantage over older agents ( 69 ) . quinupristin / dalfopristin is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci such as s. pneumoniae , generally bacteriostatic against enterococcus faecium , and inactive against e. faecalis ( 70 ) . because quinupristin / dalfopristin is available only in an intravenous formulation , its utility for treating respiratory tract infections is limited to hospitalized patients moreover , clinical data on quinupristin / dalfopristin therapy of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by macrolide resistant strains of s. pneumoniae is lacking . telithromycin , the first of a new class of antibacterials , the ketolides , is approved for use in europe and is currently being reviewed by the u. s. food and drug administration ( 71 ) . the clinical use of telithromycin in germany , as well as safety data presented to the food and drug administration , suggests that the toxicity and adverse reactions are similar to those of clarithromycin . this similarity is not surprising , as the ketolides are novel semisynthetic erythromycin - a derivatives structurally similar to clarithromycin . the c6-hydroxyl of erythromycin - a has been replaced by a methoxy group , as in clarithromycin , improving acid stability . the main structural innovation is the lack of the neutral sugar , cladinose , in position c3 . the 3-l - cladinose sugar moiety is removed , and the resulting 3-hydroxy group is oxidized to a 3-keto group , which is responsible for preventing induction of macrolide resistance ( 72 ) . telithromycin is produced through substitution at positions 11 and 12 of the erythronolide a ring with a butyl imidazolyl pyridinyl side chain . the resulting c11,c12 carbamate extension facilitates a distinctly different and more effective interaction with domain ii of the 23s rrna than occurs with erythromycin - a or clarithromycin ( 73 ) and is responsible for increased activity against erythromycin - a  resistant gram - positive cocci , such as s. pneumoniae , which develop resistance due to increased efflux ( 74,75 ) . moreover , the bactericidal action is effective against a number of other key respiratory pathogens , such as h. influenzae and c. pneumoniae ( 7678 ) , other gram - negative bacilli , such as m. catarrhalis and bordetella pertussis , and the intracellular pathogen legionella pneumophila ( 79 ) . unlike erythromycin - a ( which interacts with bacterial 23s ribosomal rna by contacts limited to hairpin 35 in domain ii of the ribosomal rna and to the peptidyl transferase loop in domain v ) , telithromycin is not a true macrolide because the l - cladinose moiety at position c3 has been replaced by a keto group and by alkylaryl side chains at positions c11,c12 . although both erythromycin - a and telithromycin bind to the peptidyl transferase loop ( the site of methylation by resistant bacteria ) , telithromycin binds much more avidly to hairpin 35 than erythromycin - a . in fact , telithromycin interacts strongly with two domains of the bacterial 23s rrna ( domains ii and v ) , which fold together in the tertiary 23s rrna to form a single drug - binding pocket ( 80,81 ) . the lack of the l - cladinose moiety , as well as the enhanced binding at domain ii and v , may explain why ketolides are associated with a low potential for inducing resistance ( 82,83 ) and contributes to telithromycin s sustained activity against mlsb - resistant strains ( in particular those with domain v modifications ) ( 73 ) . these features , in addition to the mic and the amount of drug delivered to the infection site , are considered strong predictors of a positive outcome ( 29,30 ) . however , the population has had enormous exposure to earlier macrolides . this influence means that resistance due to efflux or methylation of the 23s ribosome ( domain v ) may have already occurred in a large number of pneumococcal isolates . macrolide - resistant strains of s. pneumoniae to date have had a low incidence of cross - resistance to telithromycin ( 82,83 ) . however , increased efflux or other mutations might result in resistance to ketolides . to date , only two ketolide - resistant strains of s. pneumoniae have been identified ( 84 ) in over 10,000 pneumococcal isolates screened by the protekt study ( 10 ) . clearly , careful monitoring for ketolide resistance by surveillance studies such as the protekt study will need to be continued . meeting the challenge presented by the increasing numbers of bacterial pathogens resistant to common antibiotic treatments will require new types of antibacterial agents . therapies that maximize bactericidal effects are important because they reduce the development of bacterial resistance mechanisms . therefore , the use of bactericidal agents such as telithromycin for therapy of respiratory tract infections may well ensure that the antibacterial era endures long into the 21st century . however , careful monitoring of resistance will be needed to ensure that this agent remains active against common pathogens . stratton is associate professor of pathology and medicine and director of the clinical microbiology laboratory at the vanderbilt university medical center in nashville , tennessee . his research interests include the mechanisms of antimicrobial activity , antimicrobial resistance , and the pathogenesis of chlamydia pneumoniae .","the global emergence of antibacterial resistance among common and atypical respiratory pathogens in the last decade necessitates the strategic application of antibacterial agents . 
 the use of bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic agents as first - line therapy is recommended because the eradication of microorganisms serves to curtail , although not avoid , the development of bacterial resistance . 
 bactericidal activity is achieved with specific classes of antimicrobial agents as well as by combination therapy . 
 newer classes of antibacterial agents , such as the fluoroquinolones and certain members of the macrolide / lincosamine / streptogramin class have increased bactericidal activity compared with traditional agents . 
 more recently , the ketolides ( novel , semisynthetic , erythromycin - a derivatives ) have demonstrated potent bactericidal activity against key respiratory pathogens , including streptococcus pneumoniae , haemophilus influenzae , chlamydia pneumoniae , and moraxella catarrhalis . 
 moreover , the ketolides are associated with a low potential for inducing resistance , making them promising first - line agents for respiratory tract infections .",223
"we report the case of a 19-year - old female football spectator who suffered a duodenal rupture as a result of being hit in the abdomen by a football . a 19-year - old girl presented to the emergency department at 1 am after having a football kicked from a distance of 510 m into her abdomen 7 h previously whilst watching a game . her observations were stable ; however , on examination , her abdomen was diffusely tender and there was evidence of generalized peritonism . she had a white cell count of 18.8  10/l , but the rest of her blood tests , including amylase , was normal . a computed tomographic ( ct ) scan of her abdomen and pelvis was arranged , which showed abnormal areas of low attenuation and multiple pockets of air in the right flank , surrounding the right kidney and in the right sub - hepatic space , consistent with a perforation of either the ascending colon or the duodenum ( fig .  1 ) . a laparotomy was performed and a 0.5 cm perforation was seen in the antero - lateral border of the duodenum at the junction of the first and second parts of the duodenum following kocherization . figure  1:ct of abdomen showing free air in right para - renal space ( white arrow ) . ct of abdomen showing free air in right para - renal space ( white arrow ) . the duodenum is a  c-shaped organ primarily situated in the retroperitoneum and is anatomically divided into four sections ( d1d4 ) . it is vulnerable to damage by shearing or compression forces , as d1 and d4 are relatively mobile in comparison with d2 and d3 , which are fixed . commonly injuries occur at the junction between d3 and d4 and at the junction between d1 and d2 , as seen in this case [ 1 , 2 ] . the retroperitoneal nature of the duodenum may also result in delays in the diagnosis of duodenal rupture as patients may not present with frank peritonism initially . it is therefore important to consider both mechanism of injury and also other clinical signs such as tachycardia and raised white cell count as delays in diagnosis and subsequent management have been shown to adversely affect morbidity and mortality [ 18 ] . however , in this case , due to the positioning of the perforation , duodenal contents entered the peritoneal cavity directly from the point of rupture , thus causing peritoneal irritation . duodenal injuries secondary to blunt trauma can range in severity from an intramural haematoma to a complete transection and devascularization of the duodenum , and are graded 15 by the american association for surgery of trauma [ 2 , 5 , 6 ] . ct scanning is a useful adjunct to in the diagnosis of duodenal rupture , and can aid in the differentiation between full thickness rupture that requires surgical intervention and a haematoma which can be managed conservatively . the finding of fluid in the right anterior para - renal space on a ct scan may be seen in the presence of a duodenal haematoma , whereas if air is seen in this area duodenal rupture is likely to have occurred [ 14 , 6 , 9 ] . in this case , ct scanning was useful in delineating the possible area where a perforation may be found , especially as the patient presented with generalized abdominal pain . there are multiple ways to repair a duodenal rupture and these are obviously dependant on the severity of the injury . the literature suggests that kocherization ( mobilization ) of the duodenum should be performed to allow full examination of the duodenum to rule out multiple perforations [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 9 ] . duodenal perforations are uncommon secondary to blunt trauma , comparative to penetrating trauma . a retrospective study analysing a trauma database of 103,864 patients showed that only 0.2% ( 208 patients ) had a duodenal injury related to blunt trauma and of these only 30 patients had full thickness duodenal rupture . the most common mechanism of injury was involvement in a road traffic accident [ 1 , 3 ] . duodenal rupture as a result of a sporting injury is very rare and there are no reports of duodenal injury from the specific mechanism described in this report [ 8 , 10 ] . this case demonstrates that even if the mechanism of injury seems trivial , a high level of suspicion should be maintained in the presence of suggestive clinical findings . it also shows the benefit of ct scanning in the diagnosis and management of duodenal rupture .","duodenal rupture secondary to blunt trauma is a relatively uncommon event and is usually a result of a road traffic accident . 
 as the duodenum is a retroperitoneal organ , delays in diagnosis can occur , as the patient may present with vague abdominal symptoms and other non - specific signs . 
 computed tomographic scanning is therefore a useful tool in the diagnosis of this condition . 
 we present a 19-year - old girl who was hit in the abdomen with a football and subsequently had a duodenal rupture .",105

"studies have shown that statins can inhibit the action of hmg - coa reductase in the liver , thereby slowing down the cholesterol production process . clinical studies have also shown that statins can reduce the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death in patients with heart disease such as coronary artery disease and cardiovascular disease [ 2 , 3 ] . in addition , researchers have reported that statins may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer , non - small lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , and esophageal cancer [ 47 ] . although these drugs have a satisfactory safety record , the increased risk for developing new - onset diabetes mellitus during extended statin use has recently generated attention ; this includes simvastatin ( 10% ) , atorvastatin ( as , 22% ) , and rosuvastatin ( 18% ) [ 811 ] . have recently found that these statins reduced insulin sensitivity and pancreatic -cell function , possibly because of the effect on ca channels in -cells , glucose transporter 4 translocation , insulin receptor substrate-1 and insulin receptor expression or phosphorylation , adipocyte maturation or differentiation , isoprenoid and coenzyme q10 biosynthesis , and adiponectin and leptin levels [ 12 , 13 ] . however , studies on pravastatin showed significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and -cell function [ 14 , 15 ] . therefore , demonstrating the proposed mechanisms of statins therapy during the development of new - onset diabetes may be valuable for designing a new generation of statins without the aforementioned side effects . poly(adp - ribosyl ) polymerase-1 ( parp1 ) is a group of nuclear enzymes that has been associated with three different modes of cell death induced by dna damage , namely , apoptosis , necrosis , and parthanatos . in addition , its overactivation results in nad / atp energy depletion and eventually causes necrotic cell death [ 1619 ] . however , studies have identified a novel function of parp1 in mediating autophagy ; thus , parp1 exhibits a dual role in modulating autophagy and necrosis under oxidative stress and dna damage [ 2022 ] . autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation system for the removal of long - lived proteins and damaged organelles such as lysosomes . studies have indicated that autophagy may prevent neurodegeneration , aging , and tumorigenesis [ 2327 ] . by contrast , several studies have suggested that autophagy may trigger and mediate type ii programmed cell death , which has been referred to as autophagic cell death [ 28 , 29 ] . autophagy has also been demonstrated as a prosurvival mechanism against cell death , especially under stress conditions such as starvation , metabolic stress , oxidative stress , and dna damage [ 30 , 31 ] . thus , this study examined the signaling pathway linking parp1 activation to autophagy under pharmaceutical stress , as well as the functional role of autophagy in pharmaceutical stress - mediated cell death . mouse pancreatic nit-1 cells were obtained from bcrc ( bioresource collection and research center , taiwan ) and cultured in f-12k medium ( sigma - aldrich , usa ) supplemented with 10% fbs ( gibco , usa ) at 37c in a humidified 5% co2 . cells were seeded into a 96-well plate ( 6  10/well ) on f-12k medium and treated with statin ( 1020  m , merck millipore , germany ) for 48  h , beginning 24  h after seeding . wst-1 solution ( 10  l , roche , germany ) was added to each well and the cells were incubated for 1  h. the absorbance at 440  nm was measured using a microplate reader ( fluostar galaxy , germany ) . in some experiments , the cells were pretreated with various inhibitors such as necrostatin-1 ( nec-1 , an inhibitor of rip1 , 10  m , enzo life sciences , usa ) , necrosulfonamide ( nsa , an inhibitor of mlkl , 1.0  m , millipore ) , bafilomycin a1 ( baf -

day cultured nit-1 cells were treated with statin for 48  h. the supernatants were collected and the insulin concentrations were measured using rat / mouse insulin 96-well plate assay ( millipore ) according to the manufacturer 's instruction ; the absorbance at 450  nm and 590  nm was measured by an elisa reader ( fluostar galaxy ) . il-6 was determined using the mouse il-6 elisa kit ( bd biosciences , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instruction ; the absorbance at 450  nm was measured by an elisa reader ( fluostar galaxy ) . the lower limit of detection for this elisa was 3.8  pg / ml il-6 . nit-1 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate ( 6  10/well ) and cultured in statin - containing medium supplemented with 1% fbs for 48  h. after applying 100  l of the lactate dehydrogenase reaction mixture using the cytotoxicity detection kit ( roche ) , the absorbance at 490  nm was measured by an elisa reader ( fluostar galaxy ) : cytotoxicity  ( % ) = ( exp . nit-1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 4  10 cells / well and treated with statin for 48  h. subsequently , the cells were collected , fixed with cold 70% absolute ethanol , and stored at 20c overnight . before detection subsequently , 1  ml of staining solution was added into each tube ( 20  g / ml of pi ) , followed by incubation in darkness for 30  min . finally , the stained cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer ( cytomics fc 500 , beckman coulter ) . cells were plated in a 6 cm culture dish at a seeding density of 5  10 cells / dish . the cells were trypsinized , collected by centrifugation , resuspended in 500  l of 1x annexin v binding buffer mixed with 1  l of annexin v ( biovision ) and 1  l of propidium iodide ( biovision ) , and incubated at room temperature for 15  min in darkness . the cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer ( cytomics fc 500 ) with a single laser emitting excitation light at 488  nm . the intracellular reactive oxygen species were assessed using the cellrox oxidative stress reagent ( life technologies , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . cells were plated in 12-well plates with a cell density of 8  10 cells / well and treated with statin for 48  h. after statin treatment , the cells were stained with 5  m of cellrox green reagent and incubated in darkness for 30  min . after incubation , the stained cells were analyzed using the flow cytometer ( cytomics fc 500 ) . the 2.5  10 cells were seeded in a 3.5 cm confocal dish and pretreated with various inhibitors before statin treatment . following a 48 h treatment with statin , the cells were washed with pbs to remove dead cells and serum proteins . immediately , treated or untreated nit-1 cells were stained with an antibody against rabbit monoclonal aif ( 1  :  400 , cell signaling ) or cyto - id autophagy detection kit ( enzo life sciences , farmingdale , new york , usa ) and imaged via confocal microscopy using an olympus fv1200 microscope ( tokyo , japan ) . the images were converted to 8-bit grayscale and analyzed by the imagej software . the integrated density ( intden ) provided a measure of intensity proportional to total volume and was calculated using area . after statin treatment , the cells were stained with mitotracker red and incubated at 37c for 30  min in darkness . the cells were washed three times with pbs to remove unbound dye and recultured in f-12k medium . the fluorescence of the bound dyes was analyzed using an olympus ix81 fluorescence microscope ( tokyo , japan ) . cellular atp synthesis was determined using the phosphoworks luminometric atp assay kit ( aat bioquest , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . in brief , cells were seeded into 96-well plates and pretreated with inhibitors . after statin treatment , the cells were added with 100  l of atp assay solution and incubated for 20  min at room temperature . nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were prepared from renal tissue using nuclear protein isolation - translocation assay kit ( fivephoton biochemicals , san diego , ca , usa ) and allpure mammalian mitochondria isolation kit ( allbio science inc . , whole - cell lysates were prepared using ripa lysis buffer ( millipore , 20188 ) and protein concentration was detected using a bca protein assay kit ( thermo scientific ) . a total of 150  g of cell lysates was mixed with anti - rip3 ( 2  g , genetex , usa ) or magsi - protein a / g beads ( 50  l , magnamedics , netherlands ) at 4c overnight . the beads were then collected using a magnet for 2  min , washed with pbst washing buffer three times , and subjected to elution with 40  l of 1x sds loading buffer ; the samples were incubated at 95c for 10  min . protein was separated using sds - page and transferred to 0.2  m pvdf membranes ( bio - rad , usa ) . blots were then probed with anti - rip1 , anti - rip 3 , anti - mlkl ( genetex ) , monoclonal anti - aif ( cell signaling ) , polyclonal anti - cox4 ( genetex ) , polyclonal anti - pcna ( genetex ) , monoclonal anti - parp1 , monoclonal anti - par ( cell signaling ) , anti - phospho - ampk ( thr172 ) , anti - ampk , anti - phospho - p70 s6 kinase ( thr389 ) , anti - p70 s6 kinase ( cell signaling , usa ) , mitoprofile total oxphos rodent antibody cocktail ( mitosciences , or ) , and mouse anti - gapdh ( abcam , usa ) . signals were obtained using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( millipore ) and densitometry was performed using fusion - capt software ( vilber lourmat , fusion fx7 , france ) . to determine the effects of statin on the cell viability of pancreatic  cells , nit-1 cells were treated with various concentrations of as or ps for 48  h by using the wst-1 assay . after treatment with as ( 10  m and 20  m ) , the cell viabilities were determined to be approximately 52.3% and 41.0% , respectively , compared with the vehicle control . moreover , after treatment with ps ( 10  m and 20  m ) , the cell viabilities were determined to be approximately 104.9% and 98.6% , respectively , compared with the vehicle control . accordingly , treatment with as results in the dose - dependent inhibition of cell viability in nit-1 cells , but not treatment with ps ( figure 1(a ) ) . similarly , the reduction of cell viabilities under the 10 m and 20 m as treatment could be associated with the decreased nit-1 cell insulin secretion and increased lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) activity release , which is a cytosolic marker . although the 20 m ps treatment resulted in less insulin secretion in the nit-1 cells , it was insufficient to change the amount of ldh activity release ( figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) ) . to further examine the inhibitory effects of as or ps on cell viability the treatment of nit-1 cells with as resulted in the significantly increased accumulation of cells in the sub - g1 phase ( necrotic / apoptotic cells ) in a dose - dependent manner , and the treatment with 20  m as resulted in significantly fewer cells in the g0/g1 phase ( p < 0.05 ) . the ps treatment did not change cell cycle parameters ( figure 2(a ) ) . significantly increased necrosis phase ( pi annexin v ) percentages were found in proportion to the as treatments ( 15.95% and 24.08% in the presence of 10 and 20  m as , resp . , p < 0.05 ) , and the apoptotic phase ( pi annexin v , data not shown ) percentages were not significantly different among the groups . in addition , no significant difference was identified in the necrosis phase and apoptotic phase among the groups during the experimental period with ps treatment , compared to the vehicle control ( figure 2(b ) ) . to further confirm whether the nit-1 cell death was caused by necrosis after as treatment the il-6 expression level was significantly increased in the as - treated groups 1.3- and 1.6-fold . however , no significant differences were found in the ps - treated groups compared with the vehicle control ( figure 2(c ) ) . in addition , the as treatment of nit-1 cells induced a dose - dependent increase of intracellular ros production ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas ps treatment did not result in significant differences among the groups ( figure 2(d ) ) . the results indicate that as treatment can diminish nit-1 cell viability primarily by triggering necrosis and possibly increase production of ldh , il-6 , and ros . next , we examined the inhibitor cell death response in the nit-1 cells treated with as and ps . nec-1 , nsa , and zvad - fmk are typically used as necrosis and pan - caspase inhibitors in vitro , respectively [ 30 , 31 ] . after 48  h , nsa and nec-1 treatment increased the numbers of viable nit-1 cells compared with the 20 m as - treated group ( 61% versus 58% versus 41% , p < 0.05 ) ; zvad - fmk treatment exhibited no effect on nit-1 cell viability after the 20 m as treatment . in addition , nsa , nec-1 , and zvad - fmk treatments showed no significant differences when compared to the 20 m ps - treated group ( 98% versus 101% versus 98% , figure 3(a ) ) . by contrast , the necrosis induced by the as treatment specifically caused the formation of the rip1-rip3-mlkl complex . the interactions between mlkl and rip1 and rip3 were significantly eliminated by nsa and nec-1 ; thus , the rip1 and mlkl signals appeared significantly reduced , and the rip3 signal was significantly augmented in the presence of nsa and nec-1 . the ps treatment did not induce the formation of the rip1-rip3-mlkl complex ( figure 3(b ) ) . here , we investigated the upstream signaling pathways controlling the as- and ps - mediated cell death . parp1 activation has been suggested to be associated with the necrotic and parthanatos cell death progress [ 17 , 19 , 32 , 33 ] . dpq markedly reduced the statin - associated necrotic cell death in nit-1 cells and significantly increased nit-1 cell viability in the 20 m as - treated group ( 58% versus 41% , p < 0.05 , figure 3(a ) ) . confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation revealed that as - treated or ps - treated cells did not induce apoptosis - inducing factor ( aif ) translocation from mitochondria into the nucleus ( figures 3(c)3(e ) , figure s1a in supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/1828071 ) , suggesting that parp1 activation plays crucial roles in as - induced necrotic cell death , not via parthanatos . several studies have demonstrated that parp1 exhibits a dual role in modulating autophagy and necrosis under oxidative stress and dna damage , whereas parp1 activation is associated with autophagy induction in as and ps treatment . rapamycin ( rapa ) is an mtor inhibitor and has been reported to promote autophagy processing , whereas bafilomycin a1 ( baf - a1 ) is an autophagy inhibitor . the nit-1 cell viability was significantly increased when the cells were treated with 20  m as with rapa , and the cell viability decreased mildly with baf - a1 pretreatment , compared with the 20 m as - treated group ( 56% versus 43% versus 45% , p < 0.05 ) . similarly , the nit-1 cells with rapa pretreatment showed considerably increased cell viability compared with the 20 m ps - treated group ( 125% versus 97% , p < 0.05 , figure 4(a ) , figure s1b ) . ldh activity release also was measured to determine the extent of nit-1 cell death after exposure to inhibitor agents such as dpq , baf - a1 , and rapa . the treatment with dpq and rapa markedly reduced ldh release after the 20 m as treatment ( 1.3- versus 1.2- versus 1.5-fold , p < 0.05 ) , whereas the baf - a1 treatment mildly increased ldh compared to the 20 m as - treated group ( figure 4(b ) , figure s1c ) . similarly , the baf - a1 treatment enhanced the ldh release content considerably , and the dpq treatment only slightly reduced ldh activity release . rapa treatment can attenuate baf - a1-associated increase in the ldh activity release of nit-1 cells after 20 m ps treatment ( 1.3- versus 1.4- versus 1.1-fold , p < 0.05 ) . these results showed that autophagy acts as a cell survival mechanism in as - induced necrotic cell death and that ps may be able to immediately induce autophagy to prevent nit-1 cell death under pharmaceutical stress . to evaluate whether parp1 expression plays a crucial role in autophagic induction , nit-1 cells were incubated in medium containing vehicle ( control ) , statin , statin+dpq ( parp1 inhibitor ) , statin+baf - a1 ( negative autophagy ) , and statin+rapa ( positive autophagy ) for 48  h. the cells were then stained with cyto - id green dye autophagy detection kit . both as - treated groups showed significantly stimulated further microtubule - associated protein 1a/1b - light chain 3- ( lc3- ) ii accumulation , as autophagosome formation in nit-1 cells compared with the vehicle control . as+baf - a1-treated group showed significantly reduced lc3-ii expression compared with as - treated group . no significant difference was found in the number of lc3-ii between control and ps - treated or ps+baf - a1-treated nit-1 cells . both dpq- and rapa - treated nit-1 cells showed significantly bright green fluorescence compared with only as - treated cells but only showed light green fluorescence when compared with ps - treated cells , respectively ( figures 5(a)5(c ) , figure s2a ) . these findings indicated that as - treated cells significantly induced the autophagic activity ; both dpq- and rapa - treated cells further enhanced the as - treated increase of autophagy flux in nit-1 cells . parp1 is known as an energetically expensive process that leads to cellular atp depletion and contributes to necrotic cell death . thus , atp depletion was determined in as - treated and ps - treated nit-1 cells , and the results showed that the cellular atp levels of as - treated , as+baf - a1-treated , as+dpq - treated , and as+rapa - treated nit-1 cells were significantly reduced compared with the untreated control ( p < 0.05 ) . however , dpq- and rapa - treated cells showed significantly increased as - stimulated cellular atp consumption , decreasing 0.86- and 0.66-fold ( p < 0.05 , figure 5(d ) , figure s2b ) . in addition , the rapa - treated cells similarly exhibited significantly increased ps - stimulated cellular atp consumption , but no significant difference was found in the cellular atp levels among the ps - treated groups . the results clearly indicated that as - induced parp1 activation , mtor suppression , and autophagy induction are mediated by inhibited parp1 activation and enhance cellular atp depletion . after demonstrating the prosurvival role of autophagy and the role of parp1 activation in as - induced necrotic cell death , we investigated whether the signaling pathway of parp1-ampk - mtor autophagy controls as- and ps - mediated cell survival . treatment with as+dpq markedly blocked as - enhanced parp1 cleavage and par expression , with a simultaneous decrease in the p - ampk level and increase in p - p70s6k level ( p < 0.05 , figure 6(a ) , figure s3a ) . as+baf - a1 was expected to inhibit parp1 cleavage and par formation ; it reduced the p - ampk level , restored p - p70s6k activation , and blocked autophagy induction . moreover , cells that were treated with rapa markedly enhanced as - induced parp1 cleavage and par and ampk activation and eliminated the phosphorylation of p70s6k to induce autophagy . similar effects were also found in the nit-1 cells with ps+dpq , ps+baf - a1 , and ps+rapa ( p < 0.05 , figure 6(b ) ) . the results show that parp1 exhibits dual roles in changing the outcome of nit-1 cells in response to as . parp1 activation is the cause of necrotic cell death through atp depletion , and parp1 activation can elicit a self - protective mechanism through the induction of autophagy via the ampk - mtor signaling pathway ; however , necrotic cell death still eventually occurs . parp1-ampk activation is an important prosurvival mechanism in ps - treated cells through the suppression of mtor and activation of autophagy . we examined the mitochondrial status of the as- and ps - treated cells conjugated with mitotracker red ; the accumulation of the cells is dependent on the membrane potential , and the cells are fusible into actively respiring cells . the as- and ps - treated cells showed reduced red fluorescence intensity with fewer mitochondria ; for the as - treated cells , the reduction was approximately 0.5-fold relative to the control , and they contained round , discrete mitochondria and widely diffused weak cytoplasmic fluorescence ( figure 7 , figure s3b ) . similar effects were also found in nit-1 cells treated with as+baf - a1 and ps+baf - a1 . dpq and rapa pretreatment to some extent protected against as- and ps - induced leakage of mitotracker staining and substantially enhanced the mitochondrial morphology and staining intensity in nit-1 cells . these results indicated that as treatment reduced mitotracker staining , thereby reducing mitochondrial activity ; this explains the close association between parp1 activation and mtor suppression . the detailed mechanisms of the increased risk for developing diabetes during statin therapy remain unclear . we used the mouse nit-1 insulinoma cell line as a pancreatic -cell model , which is an effective tool for analyzing -cell function and apoptosis [ 35 , 36 ] . to examine whether statins mediate the outcome of nit-1 cells , we used chemical inhibitor reagents to inhibit the expression of the target gene in nit-1 cells . our study results showed that atorvastatin treatment markedly reduced cell viability compared to untreated nit-1 cells through increasing parp1 activation and subsequently inducing necrosis and autophagy induction . this finding confirms previous findings that atorvastatin induced autophagic activity in vivo and in vitro [ 3740 ] . in 2012 , lim et al . demonstrated that pravastatin can improve renal function in csa - induced autophagic cell death through reducing lc3-ii and p62 expression . , we find that pravastatin treatment may increase parp1 activation and immediately elicit a basal self - protective autophagy mechanism in conservative nit-1 cells under pharmaceutical stress . in contrast , other studies showed that pravastatin did not result in induced autophagy activation in ovarian cancer cell , smooth muscle cell , and human rhabdomyosarcoma cell [ 4244 ] . the reason for the differences observed is that the role of pravastatin in autophagy activation and function are cell type - specific . in this study , parp1 exhibited dual roles in regulating the cell outcome in response to as or ps treatment . the findings provide a reasonable basis for the future improvement of statin - based cardiovascular disease therapies . apoptosis has been considered to be the predominant mechanism induced by free fatty acids , cytokines , and glucose in nit-1 cells [ 36 , 45 , 46 ] . in addition , several studies have shown that as and ps could trigger different cells to mediate apoptosis in vitro and regulate cell growth in vivo [ 4750 ] . we found that cell death was not inhibited by the pan - caspase inhibitor zvad - fmk in nit-1 cells treated with as . the lack of apoptosis was further indicated by the absence of the apoptotic phase ( annexin v / pi ) . given that as killed 50%60% of nit-1 cells , these observations suggest that the effect of as - induced nit-1 cell death may not depend on apoptosis . according to the aforementioned studies , more than 50% of bladder cancer cells , t24 , died 2 - 3 days after as treatment ( 30  m ) via activated caspase 3 and cleaved parp . in another study , increased annexin v - positive cells and accumulated sub - g1 cell fractions were observed on day 3 after as treatment with an increased dose ( 100  m ) , whereas as treatment at 10  m showed a protective trend against apoptosis . thus , mechanisms other than apoptosis might exist in as - mediated cell death , such as necrosis . in recent years , the crosstalk among autophagy , apoptosis , and necrosis has been intensively studied . most studies showed that autophagy is cytoprotective in cells under stress and inhibits apoptosis and necrosis [ 21 , 5356 ] . moreover , necrosis is found to be typically accompanied by autophagy , but how autophagy counteracts necrosis and why autophagy can not protect against as - induced cell death remain unclear . we found that as induces autophagy and necrotic cell death mediated by the activation of parp1 and ros . a major finding in the present study is the crucial role of ampk in as- and ps - induced autophagy and cell death , as well as the downstream of parp1 activation . ampk is a highly conserved cellular energy sensor , and it is activated under stress conditions such as heat shock , hypoxia , ischemia , and glucose starvation [ 39 , 57 , 58 ] . some evidence suggests that autophagy induction is regulated through ampk - dependent phosphorylation , which leads to the inactivation of mtor for homeostatic mitochondria and promotes cell survival [ 40 , 59 , 60 ] . consistent with these findings , our results revealed that the activation of ampk leads to the suppression of mtor and induction of autophagy in nit-1 cells exposed to as and ps . moreover , this study clearly suggested that autophagy is a cell survival mechanism in as- and ps - mediated cell death , based on the suppression of autophagy caused by baf - a1 . by contrast , the activation of autophagy caused by rapamycin protected the as- and ps - mediated cell death . therefore , our findings suggest that targeting autophagy or parp1-ampk - mtor pathways should be considered in the development of effective statin therapies for diabetes . in conclusion , based on a literature review , this study was the first to demonstrate a novel function of parp1 in the regulation of as- and ps - induced autophagy via the parp1-ampk - mtor signaling pathway and that such autophagy serves as a cell survival mechanism against as - mediated necrosis , although it is insufficient to prevent necrosis - induced cell death ( figure 8) . these findings contribute to the understanding of the complex relationship among statin - related diabetes , autophagy , and cell death .","statins have been widely used drugs for lowering low - density lipoprotein and for preventing heart attack and stroke . however , the increased risk for developing diabetes during extended stain use and the molecular mechanisms remain unclear . 
 the objective of this study was to elucidate the signaling pathway and biological function between necrosis and autophagy induced by atorvastatin ( as ) and pravastatin ( ps ) . 
 here we observed that atorvastatin ( as ) can increase intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and induce necrotic cell death and autophagy in nit-1 cells , whereas pravastatin ( ps ) does not cause ros and cell death but also induces autophagy . 
 parp1 exhibited a dual role in modulating necrosis and autophagy in as- and ps - treated nit-1 cells through rip1-rip3-mlkl pathway and parp1-ampk - mtor pathway . 
 lastly , as treatment induced mitochondrial morphology injury significantly more than ps treatment did . 
 thus , the parp1 activation should be considered in the development of effective statin therapies for diabetes . 
 future studies may examine specific mechanisms and pathways in mitochondria , autophagy , and oxidative stress in vivo .",250
"when evaluating patients for clinical trial , intrauterine pregnancy is commonly considered an exclusion criteria , however guidelines do not exist to determine what to do should a pregnancy test result as positive . the patient underwent standard - of - care therapy upfront with progression of disease and was referred to investigational therapeutics for phase i treatment . pelvic ultrasound and -hcg heterophilic antibody testing were negative ruling out intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy or phantom hcg . her elevated -hcg appeared consistent with paraneoplastic syndrome reflected in a decline in -hcg that correlated with a response to treatment . a 34-year - old african american female with metastatic mucinous ovarian carcinoma presented with a pelvic mass discovered during her annual gynecological examination . an ultrasound showed a 7.7    8.7  cm left ovarian mass with complex appearance . laparoscopic left salpingo - oophorectomy showed a moderately differentiated mucinous ovarian carcinoma , stage ic1 , due to intraoperative rupture of the ovarian mass . tumor cells were diffusely positive for keratin 7 and very focally positive for keratin 20 . the patient was taken for diagnostic laparoscopy with appendectomy , omentectomy , and multiple peritoneal biopsies by a gynecologic oncologist ; all of which were negative for malignancy . eight weeks later the patient started adjuvant chemotherapy with one cycle of capecitabine and oxaliplatin ( xelox ) , transitioned to four months of fluorouracil and oxaliplatin ( folfox ) due to insurance issues . the ct abdomen and pelvis post folfox chemotherapy showed an enhancing 2.6  cm nodule in rectus abdominis muscle . the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with excision of a 5    6  cm abdominal mass involving fascia and muscle , consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma . after recovery , the patient received chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6  months . the ct abdomen and pelvis performed following 6  months of carboplatin and paclitaxel showed progression of disease with new nodal and perihepatic implants . the patient subsequently consulted with the md anderson cancer center department of investigational cancer therapeutics for phase i clinical trial options . the patient was treated with a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase ( pi3k ) inhibitor plus a mitogen / extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( mek ) inhibitor with progression of disease after 5  months . she then started on a second phase i trial with a polymeric micellar nanoparticle of the substance dach - pt ( 1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum ) , an in vivo metabolite of oxaliplatin , with progression following 1  cycle of therapy . the patient was then enrolled in a trial with paclitaxel , bevacizumab and temsirolimus ( pat ) . on the day of clearance to start treatment , she was found to have a positive urine and serum pregnancy test . the left ovary was surgically absent however the right ovary was enlarged with complex cystic mass with solid components measuring 9.5    6.6  cm . the work - up for false positive elevation of -hcg including serial dilutions , incorporation of animal serum and outside institutional validation testing for -hcg heterophile antibody , was negative . therefore , the -hcg elevation was not thought to be related to a phantom hcg . dilation and curettage to rule out trophoblastic disease was planned , but not completed due to discovery of a deep vein thrombosis and initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation . as no intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy could be identified , after several weeks , the patient returned to clinic and was cleared to start treatment . at that time , her -hcg was 210.3 . three weeks post treatment with pat , the -hcg decreased to 27.5 and ct scans showed partial response ( fig . , the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for weakness due to guillain barre syndrome . nearly all female patients undergoing enrollment on clinical trial are evaluated for pregnancy as part of standard exclusion criteria . an elevated -hcg in the absence of viable pregnancy can occur for multiple reasons and has a broad differential diagnosis including miscarriage , ectopic pregnancy , pituitary hcg production , trophoblastic disease and phantom hcg . ectopic pregnancy is frequently suspected when -hcg levels plateau or fail to double within 48  h without evidence of intrauterine pregnancy with ultrasound . when intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy are ruled out , pituitary hcg may be produced in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women . as estrogen and progesterone production decreases , releasing gonadotropin releasing hormone ( gnrh ) from negative feedback , luteinizing hormone ( lh ) and follicular stimulating hormone ( fsh ) rise . the  subunit gene of lh is found in a sequence of 7 hcg  subunit genes and therefore uncontrolled gnrh stimulation may lead to hcg production by pituitary gonadotrope cells ( cole , 2005 ) . using an fsh level of 45.0  miu / ml identified hcg of perimenopausal women , ages 4155  years , with mildly increased serum hcg concentrations ( 5.014.0  miu / ml ) , an fsh cutoff of 45.0  miu / ml identified hcg of placental origin with 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity . fsh levels greater than 45  miu / ml were never observed when hcg was of placental origin . when hcg is less than 5.0  miu / ml , fsh testing is not performed as pregnancy is unlikely . when hcg is greater than 14.0  miu / ml , fsh testing is not performed as this is consistent with pregnancy ( gronowski et al . , 2008 ) . in one study , two weeks of estrogen - progesterone therapy suppressed pituitary hcg and may help confirm diagnosis ( cole et al . , 2007 ) . gestational trophoblastic disease is a group of conditions that may be classified as either premalignant , in the case of a partial or complete hydatidiform mole , or malignant , including invasive mole , choriocarcinoma , placental - site trophoblastic tumor and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor . although not always the case , -hcg is commonly found to be elevated in these conditions and these diseases are considered high on the differential diagnosis list when found . phantom hcg is a phenomenon first described in 1998 by laurence cole , ph.d . , where patients have persistent mild elevations of -hcg , occasionally following miscarriage . the elevated -hcg often falsely interpreted and misleads physicians to evaluate or incorrectly treat patients with cytotoxic agents for trophoblast disease ( cole , 1998 ) . heterophilic antibodies against mouse , goat , rabbit , cow , horse , or sheep antigens can interfere with two - site immunoassays by creating complexes between the two anti--hcg antibodies without -hcg being present . this leads to a false - positive result ( vladutiu et al . , 1982 ) . people can develop heterophilic antibodies by exposure to the serum , tissue , or other antigens of nonhuman species . heterophilic antibodies do not appear to be excreted in the urine and therefore urine assays can be used to identify false - positive serum results . serial dilutions may also be performed to assess for interference . to avoid false positives , the excess of nonspecific antibodies saturates heterophilic antibodies in human serum and usually eliminates their interference with the assay ( johnson et al . , 2000 ) . additionally , serum samples can be sent to outside laboratories with different assay systems to validate results . in our patient 's case , the patient continued to have normal menstrual cycles and was using two forms of contraception with her husband who had history of vasectomy . the work up , including pelvic ultrasound and ct scans , was negative for pregnancy and trophoblastic disease . it was therefore believed that the patient 's -hcg production was due to the patient 's tumor , consistent with a paraneoplastic syndrome . paraneoplastic syndromes occur in about 8% of cancer patients and frequently develop with advanced disease . they may appear earlier than symptoms of the primary tumor itself , leading to new diagnosis of cancer ( pelosof and gerber , 2010 ) . it can also be found in the testis , liver , lung , colon , and stomach in small amounts . malignancies in these organs may lead to an increased serum levels ( demirtas et al . a gastric origin is the most frequent , ranging from 11% to 17% of this rare subset ( germann et al . , 2002 ) . in our case , the patient had a primary ovarian neoplasm with metastases within the abdomen . -hcg levels rose while the patient was on a treatment break , nearly impeding her from further treatment . with re - initiation of therapy , the -hcg declined , corresponding to a partial response per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) on radiographic imaging . urine hcg remained positive despite decline in serum hcg as the level was still over the detection threshold of 25 interesting enough , other tumor markers ( ca 125 , ca 15 - 3 , ca 19.9 and cea ) all increased . the decreased size of tumor within the pelvis corresponded with decreasing -hcg levels while increased hepatic metastasis corresponded to increases in other markers . this lends evidence to the idea that the patient had tumoral heterogeneity with different markers produced by tumors in different areas of the body . this is the first case of paraneoplastic -hcg production from an ovarian adenocarcinoma reported in the literature . we provide a treatment algorithm to evaluate for paraneoplastic hcg production when assessing for clinical trial eligibility ( fig . paraneoplastic syndrome should remain in the differential diagnosis in patients found to have elevated levels of -hcg without evidence of intra- or extra - uterine pregnancy . informed consent to publish the information was granted from the patient . none of the authors have conflict of interest or competing interest . jg participated in the design of the manuscript , analyzed the biomarker data and drafted the manuscript . pp jg participated in the design of the manuscript , analyzed the biomarker data and drafted the manuscript . sp conceived of the study , and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript .","there is a broad range of possible diagnoses for an elevated beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( -hcg ) in the absence of intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy . when women of child bearing potential undergo evaluation for clinical trial , it is often unclear what course of evaluation to take when a pregnancy test is positive . 
 we describe the clinical course of a patient with widely metastatic mucinous ovarian carcinoma with metastasis to the peritoneum , lymph nodes and liver . the patient was found to have a mildly elevated -hcg during initial evaluation for clinical trial .

"the estimated incidence of bnc after open retropubic radical prostatectomy ( rrp ) ranges from 3% to 26% [ 1 - 8 ] . robot - assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( ralp ) is becoming a more frequently performed procedure because it clearly has a lower rate of postoperative complications than rrp . in particular , the incidence of bnc after ralp ranges from 0.6% to 3% [ 9 - 12 ] . several case reports have suggested that rrp , pure laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( lrp ) , and ralp are associated with complications related to the use of surgical clips , including bnc and the formation of bladder stones [ 13 - 19 ] . the purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical clip - related complications that occurred after rrp , lrp , and ralp in our institution . in our institution , rrp was the method of choice for radical prostatectomy until august 2005 , when the first case of lrp was performed . thereafter , lrp was frequently performed between august 2005 and april 2008 . from may 2008 we retrospectively reviewed a database that has been maintained in our institution of the clinical , surgical , and pathological parameters of these procedures . we reviewed a total of 641 cases who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between january 2006 and april 2009 . of the 641 patients , 439 , 49 , and 153 underwent rrp , lrp , and ralp , respectively . in all cases , the median follow - up time for the entire cohort was 19.0 months ( range , 1 - 42 months ) . of the rrp , lrp , and ralp patients , 25 ( 5.7% ) , 1 ( 2.0% ) , and 2 ( 1.3% ) had bnc , respectively , and 2 of the rrp patients developed a bladder stone . in total , 6 patients with complications related to the use of surgical clips were identified in the cohort . cystoscopic examination of patient 2 indicated bnc and the presence of a metal clip protruding into the urethra through the urethrovesical anastomosis at 4 o'clock ( fig . patients 3 and 4 were both found to have a hem - o - lok clip in the bladder neck ( fig . their bncs were resolved after a single urethral dilatation , after which the symptoms disappeared . patients 5 and 6 were found to have a bladder stone that had formed around the metal clip in the bladder ( fig . retrospective re - evaluation of the kidney , ureter and bladder x - ray ( kub ) revealed the metal clip in the bladder region ( patient 5 : fig . 4 ) . during the follow - up , neither patient exhibited signs of bladder stone recurrence . in all patients , one study based on a patient self - reported questionnaire , which revealed that 25.9% of rrp patients reported at least one episode of bnc that required treatment , was unable to identify factors that could predict the occurrence of bnc . in contrast , surya et al reported that many factors promote the occurrence of bnc after rrp , including urinary extravasation , excessive blood loss , and previous bladder neck surgery . similarly , thiel et al found that 17.5% of rrp patients required stricture dilatation by a mean time of 6 months after surgery and revealed that increased age and increased blood loss were statistically associated with stricture formation . recently , erickson et al suggested that improved surgical technique and increased surgeon experience appear to be the most important factors that reduce the incidence of bnc . huang and lepor added a history of previous transurethral resection of the prostate , pelvic external beam radiotherapy , and a hypertrophic healing response to the risk factors for bnc after rrp . another study found that of the 11.1% of patients who developed bnc after rrp , the biggest risk factor was current smoking ( 26% ) , with comorbidities such as hypertension , coronary artery disease , and diabetes also being significantly associated with the formation of bnc . the investigators hypothesized that local ischemia of the urethra and bladder neck caused by microvascular disease may lead to poor anastomotic healing and scar formation . similarly , the incidence of bnc in our cohort of 153 consecutive ralp patients was 1.3% . it is not clear why the rate of bnc after ralp is significantly lower than that quoted in the rrp literature , but msezane et al suggested that it may be due to the running anastomosis , better visualization , improved instrument maneuverability , and decreased blood loss . moreover , a comprehensive review of the literature comparing rrp , lrp , and ralp revealed that higher estimated blood loss was a significant factor in the development of bnc . recently , a study comparing rrp and ralp suggested that the predisposing causes of bnc are likely to be the combination of a fixed circular bladder stomatization with the subsequent healing of the stoma anastomosis to the urethra . the present study shows that bnc may also arise as a result of clip migration . this has also been observed in the literature ( table 2 ) , although it should be noted that most reported complications with surgical clips relate to hemorrhage . long et al reported the first case of metal clip migration - induced bnc after rrp in a patient who had suffered multiple episodes of urinary retention and had undergone several failed urethrotomies . later , blumenthal et al reported the first case report of hem - o - lok migration into the vesicourethral anastomosis after ralp . those authors believe that the relationship between surgical clip migration into the anastomosis and bnc formation is not coincidental ; they postulated that the physical disruption of the anastomosis by the surgical clip contributed to poor healing and may have elicited an inflammatory reaction . tunnard et al then described a case of a hem - o - lok clip - related complication following lrp : during bladder neck dilatation for a tight bladder neck , a hem - o - lok was found in the bladder , having migrated from the urethrovesical anastomosis . it was removed successfully but a repeat cystoscopy 3 months later revealed another hem - o - lok device that had eroded through the vesicourethral anastomosis . this was removed successfully with the aid of a holmium laser . in the present study , stones developed around the surgical clip in 2 patients after rrp . other studies have also reported surgical clip - related complications other than bnc ( table 2 ) . these include the case described by palou et al of severe perineal pain after rrp due to the protrusion of a metal clip into the urethra at the urethrovesical anastomosis , and the case of banks et al , in which the migration of a hem - o - lok clip into the bladder led to stone formation after lrp . there was also a recent report by kadekawa et al of a case in which a metal clip had migrated into the urinary bladder after rrp . it was hypothesized that inflammation had arisen around the urinary bladder or vesicourethral anastomosis and that this also involved the metal clip , which then eroded the bladder wall and eventually migrated into the bladder . in addition , mora et al reported a case of intravesical migration and subsequent calculus formation with the spontaneous expulsion of a hem - o - lok clip after lrp . these findings suggest that foreign bodies in the bladder can act as a nidus for bladder stone formation owing to the presence of persistent chronic inflammation . the mechanism underlying the migration of a surgical clip into the urinary tract is unclear . in our series , the rate of bnc after ralp was significantly lower than that after rrp . because improvements in outcomes are related to temporal improvements in particular procedures , this trend might account for some improvement in outcome in the ralp group . it appears that surgical clips are prone to migration and may cause , or significantly contribute to , bnc or the formation of bladder stones after radical prostatectomy . these findings raise questions regarding the use of foreign bodies in close proximity to the vesicourethral anastomosis during radical prostatectomy . at the very least , they indicate that care must be taken with the surgical clips used for inducing hemostasis near the apex of the prostate in radical prostatectomy . in addition , because the incidence of bnc after ralp is low , when unexplained voiding difficulty occurs after ralp , one should suspect that a hem - o - lok clip has migrated , especially because hem - o - lok clips can not be detected on x - rays .","purposethe aim of this study was to describe the surgical clip - related complications that can occur after open retropubic prostatectomy ( rrp ) , pure laparoscopic prostatectomy ( lrp ) , and robot - assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( ralp).materials and methodsa database of 641 patients who underwent rrp ( n=439 ) , lrp ( n=49 ) , and ralp ( n=153 ) at our institution between january 2006 and april 2009 was reviewed to identify patients with complications related to the use of surgical clips . 
 the median follow - up time for the entire cohort was 19.0 months ( range , 1 - 42 months).resultsof the 641 patients , 25 ( 5.7% ) , 1 ( 2.0% ) , and 2 ( 1.3% ) had a bladder neck contracture after rrp , lrp , and ralp , respectively . 
 two rrp patients had a bladder stone . in total , 
 6 patients had surgical clip - related complications . 
 metal clip migration was associated with 2 ( 8% ) of the 25 rrp cases of bladder neck contracture and both ( 100% ) of the rrp cases of bladder stone . moreover , 
 both ( 100% ) of the ralp cases of bladder neck contractures were associated with hem - o - lok clip migration into the anastomotic site.conclusionssurgical clips are prone to migration and may cause , or significantly contribute to , bladder neck contracture or the formation of bladder stones after radical prostatectomy . 
 these findings also suggest that because the incidence of bladder neck contracture after ralp is low , the migration of hem - o - lok clips should be suspected when voiding difficulty occurs after ralp .",376
"it is a leading infective cause of mortality in children under 5 years of age . in 2013 , bronchopneumonia caused death in 935,000 of children under 5 years . since pediatric population is vulnerable and specific , clinical features are often non - specific and conditioned by numerous factors . these factors include certain age group , presence of comorbidity , exposure to risk factors , carried out immunization etc . the most reliable way to diagnose bronchopneumonia is through chest x - ray , but that is not enough to determine the ethiological agent , so the treatment of bronchopneumonia is clinical rather than ethiological in most cases . since bronchopneumonia is an infectious disease , antimicrobic agents must be used in the treatment , along with additional supportive and symptomatic treatment . however , frequent use of antibiotics leads to a rise in bacterial resistance ( 1 ) . bacterial resistance , along with limitations in establishment of timely diagnosis and difficult ethiological classification , often leads to severe clinical features and inadequate response to therapy , which results in increased number of treatment days , as well as increased consumption of antimicrobials . the aim of this study was to determine the most often proscribed antibiotics and supporting concomitant therapy in treatment for bronchopneumonia at the pediatric clinic in sarajevo , and to determine whether the treatment is in accordance with the british thoracic society guidelines . the study included patients under 18 with diagnosis of bronchopneumonia , patients with detailed history of the disease and detailed information on diagnostics and treatment carried out at the pediatric clinic , and patients who were hospitalized in the pulmonary department in the period from 1 july to 31 december 2014 . analysis results are displayed in tables and graphs as per number of cases , percentage , and arithmetic mean ( x ) with standard deviation ( sd ) , standard error ( se ) and a range of values ( min -

40.2 c. chest pain was experienced by 66 or 63.5% of patients , and vomiting was experienced by 64 or 64.5% of patients . duration of hospital stay ( number of days of hospitalization ) averaged 5.22.6 days , with shortest stay of 1 day and longest stay of 15 days . out of total number of subjects , 66 or 63.5% were immunized regularly . in the period of the study ( july - december ) , the largest number of patients67 of them ( 64.2%)had three dominant symptoms in clinical features . in newborn and infant age group , the following symptoms prevailed : cough , increased body temperature , and vomiting . in preschool children age group , cough was present in 87.18% , increased body temperature in 97.44% , chest pain in 66.67% , and vomiting in 41.03 % of the subjects . in school children age group , cough as a symptom was present in 79.49 % , increased body temperature in 94.87% , chest pain in 94.87 % , and vomiting in 7.69 % of the subjects . in adolescent age group , cough , chest pain and increased body temperature were present in all subjects , while vomiting was not observed at all . upon admission , crp was elevated in 100% of newborns and adolescents , in 81.82% of infants , 79.49% of preschoolers , and in 92.31% of school - age children . upon admission , white blood cell count was elevated in 50% of newborns , 72.73% of infants , 71.79% of preschoolers , 58.97% of school - age children and in 100% of adolescents . used antibiotic therapy penicillin antibiotics were administered intravenously to 26 ( 25% ) subjects . within this group , the most widely used medicine was ampicillin ( 17.68% ) , with an average dose of 1138.89  491 mg ( 450- 2000 ) , and the average duration of therapy 3.56  1.42 days ( table 1 ) . analysis of use of penicillin group of antibiotics first - generation cephalosporins were administered to 42 patients ( 40.4% ) , intravenously in all cases . the only medicine in this group that was administered was cefazolin with average dose of 1,464.3  530 mg ( 300 - 3000 ) and average treatment duration of 4.3  1.6 days ( 2 - 7 ) . analysis of use of the i generation cephalosporin third - generation cephalosporins were administered to 33 or 31.7% subjects ( intravenously in all cases ) . the most often used drug in this group was ceftazidime with an average dose of 1568  585.34 mg ( 250 - 2400 ) , and the average duration of therapy was 5.76  2.62 days ( figure 1 ) . analysis of use of the iii generation cephalosporins total duration of the antibiotic therapy averaged 4.5  1.9 days and ranged from 1 to 11 days . recommended therapy for treatment continuation medicines from the group of penicillins were recommended for continuation of treatment of 28 patients ( 26.9% ) . the most commonly recommended medication in the aforementioned group was ampicillin in two forms ( suspension and tablets ) . the average dose of ampicillin was 11.2  4.59 ml in form of suspension and 1.160  634.35 mg as tablet . the most recommended medication in this group was cefixime , with an average recommended daily dose of 8.74  4.78 ml in the form of a suspension and 828.57  455.8 mg in the form of tablets ( table 3 ) . among other drugs recommended for treatment continuation at home , antipyretics were recommended in 54 or 51.9% of cases , methylprednisolone in 53 or 51% of the cases , and montelukast in 75 or 72.1% of cases . we present the results of 104 patients who were hospitalized at pulmology department of the pediatric clinic with diagnosis of bronchopneumonia . according to the results of our study we recommend oral administration of first - generation cephalosporins and penicillin antibiotics as effective treatment for bronchopneumonia in the pediatric population . in the last 30 years , a lot of research has been done with the purpose of achieving a more effective treatment of bronchopneumonia in the pediatric population and a reduction in bronchopneumonia - caused mortality . the turning point was year 1985 when the world health organization undertook activities to establish a unified strategy to combat pneumonia worldwide ( 1 ) . the pediatric clinic of the university clinical center of sarajevo has also based its principles of treating bronchopneumonia on observing guidelines and protocols , as well as principles of good clinical practice . hence the usual empirical treatment is based on proven connection of certain causative agents with specific populations , while etiological treatment is very rare . a study done on 385 hospitalized children in africa in 2014 found that there is a very low risk of failure when using drugs mentioned in the guidelines and protocols relative to the targeted etiological treatment ( 0.37 ( 95% ci -0.84 to 0.51)(2 ) . according to the research done by the world health organization , for quality management of bronchopneumonia , certain criteria must be met in order to refer a child to hospital treatment : a child with persistent high body temperature or fever should be considered as a potential pneumonia patient ; if symptoms persist or if there is no response to treatment prescribed by pediatricians or family doctors , it is necessary to reassess and to consider the gravity of the clinical situation ; children with less than 92% oxygen saturation or children who show severe signs of respiratory distress should be hospitalized ; auscultatory absence of respiratory sounds and dull sound on percussion indicate the possibility of pneumonia with complications and can be used as an indication for hospital admission ; children with elevated parameters of acute inflammation ; children under 6 months of age with signs of disease and children with poor general health ( 3 ) . treatment of bronchopneumonia involves administration of medicines and use of high calorie dietary regimes with adequate hydration . antimicrobials used in the treatment of bronchopneumonia are first and third generation of cephalosporins , as well as penicillin based antibiotics . in our study , antibiotic therapy lasted 4.5  1.9 days on average and ranged from 1 to 11 days . cefazolin in the group of first - generation cephalosporins was administered in 42 patients , or in 40.4% of all subjects . in all patients , cefazolin was administered intravenously at a dose of 1,464.3  530 mg ( 900 - 3,000 ) and the average duration of treatment was 4.3  1.6 days third - generation cephalosporins have been administered intravenously to 33 patients , or 31.7% . the most commonly used medicine in the group of third - generation cephalosporins was ceftazidime . a total of 17 subjects in the treatment received ceftazidime , the lowest dose was given in infants ( 900 mg ) and the highest dose was given to school - aged children ( 2,400 mg ) . ampicillin as the most often used drug from the penicillin group was administered in 18 patients with an average dose of 1,173.1  500 mg ( 450 - 2,000 ) and the average treatment duration of 3.96  2 days . studies in india from 2013 , conducted on a total of 1,116 children at the pediatric departments in 20 hospitals , showed that the treatment with penicillin antibiotics is more effective in comparison to treatment with other antibiotics ( 4 ) . study showed that the second and third generation of cephalosporins were used in infants , but not in adolescents . in the treatment of children of preschool age , first - generation cephalosporins were most often used , while third - generation cephalosporins were most often used in school - aged children . in determination of difference in the use of antibiotic therapy in relation to age of patients , statistically significant difference was only demonstrated in the use of penicillin antibiotics ( p < 0.05 ) . according to the dose of administered antibiotic , it has been shown that dose increases linearly with age , with the lowest dose administered in infants . a significant difference was observed only in patients to whom cefazolin and ceftriaxone were administered ( p < 0.05 ) . there were no statistically significant differences in average duration of treatment in relation to age group ( in all < 0.05 ) , but still there were some noticeable differences . duration of treatment with third - generation cephalosporins was longest in infants ( 7 days ) and shortest in children of preschool age ( 4.7 days ) . according to the guidelines of the british thoracic society , certain guidelines every child with a clear diagnosis of pneumonia should receive antibiotic therapy since it is not possible to make immediate reliable differentiation of bacterial and viral pathogens ( 5 ) . intravenous administration of antibiotics is recommended for children suffering from pneumonia in cases when a child can not tolerate oral intake of drugs or their absorption ( i.e. due to vomiting ) , and also for hospitalized children with more severe clinical features ( 6 ) . recommended intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe bronchopneumonia are : amoxicillin , co - amoxiclav , cefuroxime and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone . use of these antibiotics can be rationalized if microbiological diagnostics is performed ( 7 ) . it is advisable to consider oral administration of medicines in patients to whom antibiotics were administered intravenously and who subsequently experienced noticeable improvement in clinical features ( 8) . american thoracic society recommends the so - called  switch  therapy , which implies switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics . the main problem is the lack of clear definition of the moment or conditions when the patient should make the switch to oral administration ( 9 ) . orally administered antibiotics and concomitant therapy are recommended for continuation of treatment , and than can be considered as a variant of the  switch  therapy . studies conducted in italy in 2012 , showed that intravenous administration of antimicrobials has several far - reaching effects on pediatric patients and treatment itself ( 10 ) . in the opinion of child psychologists , parenteral route of administration is considered to be traumatic for the child , with more rapid appearance of adverse effects ( 11 ) . studies of the american thoracic society from 2013 indicated that patients with respiratory disease should have a specific diet rich in minerals and vitamins with a moderate amount of easily digestible proteins , poor in carbohydrates and rich in fat ( 12 ) . it is necessary to work on prevention in order to reduce the incidence of morbidity . studies conducted in uk in 2003 showed that introduction of vaccination revolutionized prevention of infectious diseases . it has been shown that introduction of vaccines against measles reduced incidence of mortality by 2.5 million a year . studies conducted in the united states in the period 2009 - 2013 have shown that introduction of the conjugate vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae would make the biggest advance in prevention of pneumonia , since it is the most common etiologic agent of this type of pneumonia . controlled study with use of who standardization of radiographic definition of pneumonia included 37,868 children . vaccination effectiveness of 30.3% ( 95% ci 10.7% to 45.7% , p0.0043 ) has been observed in the study , taking into account age , sex and year of vaccination . during this four - year program implemented in the entire country , the incidence of disease was reduced by 39% ( 26 children ) in children under 2 years of age . italian single - blind study from 2012 showed that there was a statistically significant difference in occurrence of bronchopneumonia in children who are not immunized compared to those who are ( 13 ) . according to study conducted on patients hospitalized at the pulmonary department of the pediatric clinic , 38 patients ( 37% ) did not receive immunization regularly . increase in use of third - generation cephalosporins , and aminopenicillins is a cause for concern . since such increase is also observed in vulnerable pediatric population , current situation must be analyzed and restrictive - educational measures ought to be recommended based on results of such analysis . study results showed that pediatric clinic has access to modern diagnostic tests , the treatment is carried out in accordance with the protocols and guidelines , which largely correspond to the guidelines of the british thoracic society . the study shows that the results of bronchopneumonia treatment at the pediatric clinic of the university clinical center of sarajevo are comparable to the results of other studies that were conducted at pediatric clinics . first and third generation cephalosporins ( cephazolin and ceftriaxone , respectively ) and penicillin antibiotics ( ampicillin ) were most commonly used antimicrobial agents with the average duration of antibiotic therapy of 4.3 days , all of which is consistent with the guidelines of the british thoracic society . concomitant therapy usually consisted of antipyretics ( diclofenac and paracetamol ) , 2 adrenergic receptor agonist ( salbutamol ) , leukotriene receptor antagonists ( montelukast ) , and corticosteroids ( methylprednisolone ) . availability and performance of diagnostic tests , as well as pharmacological measures conform to the guidelines of the british thoracic society . for the purpose of preventing bronchopneumonia in pediatric population , specific epidemiological measures ought to be taken , and they should involve all levels of health care . awareness of early signs and symptoms of bronchopneumonia should be raised in the population , and especially parents , in order to begin treatment a timely manner . to reduce the incidence of disease , introduction of the pneumococcal vaccination","introduction : bronchopneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation of pneumonia in pediatric population and leading infectious cause of mortality in children under 5 years . evaluation of treatment involves diagnostic procedures , assessment of disease severity and treatment for disease with an emphasis on vulnerability of the population.aim:to determine the most commonly used antibiotics at the pediatric clinic in sarajevo and concomitant therapy in the treatment of bronchopneumonia.patients and methods : the study was retrospective and included a total of 104 patients , hospitalized in pulmonary department of the pediatric clinic in the period from july to december 2014 . 
 the treatment of bronchopneumonia at the pediatric clinic was empirical and it conformed to the guidelines and recommendations of british thoracic society.results and discussion : first and third generation of cephalosporins and penicillin antibiotics were the most widely used antimicrobials , with parenteral route of administration and average duration of treatment of 4.3 days . 
 concomitant therapy included antipyretics , corticosteroids , leukotriene antagonists , agonists of 2 adrenergic receptor . 
 in addition to pharmacotherapy , hospitalized patients were subjected to a diet with controlled intake of sodium , which included probiotic - rich foods and adequate hydration . 
 recommendations for further antimicrobial treatment include oral administration of first - generation cephalosporins and penicillin antibiotics.conclusion:results of the drug treatment of bronchopneumonia at the pediatric clinic of the university clinical center of sarajevo are comparable to the guidelines of the british thoracic society . it is necessary to establish a system for rational use of antimicrobial agents in order to reduce bacterial resistance .",341
"endoscopists are already successful at treating obese patients , who are more at risk of gastrointestinal ( gi ) diseases such as cancer than the general population , and assessing their gi condition before bariatric surgery . they are also increasingly efficient when helping with postoperative complications such as leaks , stenosis , or weight regain after various bariatric procedures . moreover , it seems today that they may claim a role in primary treatments of obesity , while purely endoscopic methods are available and upgraded on a regular basis . as recently stated by the american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy ( asge ) , endoscopic bariatric therapies offer a viable , safe alternative for patients who have been unsuccessful at weight loss with diet and exercise . they may also be appropriate for patients who are not suitable for , or are unwilling to undergo , a more invasive surgical procedure . if bariatric endoscopy may be viewed as a competitor to bariatric surgery , current trends suggest the development of combined strategies as well as mutual assistance when it comes to procedures that require both endoscopic and surgical skills . although expanding , the array of bariatric techniques does not meet the current needs of morbidly obese patients ( class ii to iii obesity ) . resources for spreading this type of surgery are lacking , while more basic and general procedures are not even available throughout the world . besides , they are often disregarded by a majority of patients because they are deemed  excessive . somehow , futile quarrels and surgical discrepancies are abundant , for example : should we do a hiatal hernia repair in the mean time as a sleeve gastrectomy ? should we only do the regular roux - en - y gastric bypass or can we afford the omega - loop bypass ? in the meantime , and paradoxically , bariatric surgery claims to expand its boundaries , for instance taking on class i obesity ( international federation for the surgery of obesity and metabolic disorders [ ifso ] statement , 2014 ) . several issues have been raised : should minimally invasive procedures take over ? when and how should this happen ? typical surgical concepts as well as new ones are valuable assets because they make it possible to establish benchmarks and fruitful combinations . one may cite new concepts like digestive neuro - stimulation ( theoretically adaptable endoscopically ) , new operations ( e.g. , laparoscopic greater curve plication , a debatable procedure , but with highly relevant endoscopic applications ; sleeve gastrectomy associated with ileal transposition ) . new technical approaches are on the spot as well ( e.g. , single incision laparoscopic surgery , robotic adjunction ) . three - dimensional and/or enhanced imagery last but not least , research is being carried out regarding operations in - between surgery and endoscopy , typically the natural orifice transluminal surgery procedures , e.g. , gastro - jejunal anastomosis through stents or magnets . on the other hand , other fields will contribute to any bariatric procedure , such as patient monitoring ( smartsensing ) results from the rapidly progressing field of internet on things business . although in its infancy , the possibility to continuously monitor several health parameters could find potential applications in obese patients , before or after any kind of weight - loss procedure . coaching tools are not to be ignored in a time when the importance of physical activity is stressed more often ( e.g. , vibrating platforms ) . so far , no drug has challenged the results of surgery , but some are currently being tested and even drugs that have been discarded have been proven useful in combination with bariatric techniques . moreover , fundamental research has benefited from surgery and could contribute to weight - loss by itself ; for instance , microbiota transplantation or brown tissue manipulation . none of them has yet fulfilled the requirements of a typical bariatric treatment , with sustained weight - loss and regression of comorbidities in the long run . understandably , they may act as a bridge to more complex surgical procedures and/or attract patients who are not eligible for surgery . countless procedures have been initiated , but so far very few have met efficacy criteria with published results .

( 4 ) facing the criticism of those in favor of  surgery for everyone is not the least important issue ! the current and most common position from the bariatric surgical community states that the efficacy , durability , and long - term clinical utility of endoscopic procedures remain to be established . although essentially true , this statement overlooks the fact that a majority of obese patients eligible for surgery reject these procedures and/or do not have access to them . companies and physicians alike have to overcome numerous barriers , which are present throughout the development process . regarding endoscopic devices , these barriers are particularly important . many events are in a position to kill an innovative device : if the market has not been clearly identified , or is too small , sales will not meet the expectations ; likewise if the device is too complex , or too expensive for its application . many interesting devices can be stalled if investors do not want to finance inevitable delays or if regulatory bodies request additional trials . the adoption of a new device can take longer than anticipated , and training for experienced physicians might be complicated . last but not least , any startup can be purchased by a major company in order to eliminate competition . for instance , hormonal studies are already available , which suggest more or less strong metabolic effects that could match those of surgery . have shown that after 24 weeks of implantation of the endo - barrier , patients had lost 12.71.3 kg ( p<0.01 ) , while hemoglobin a1c had improved from 8.4%0.2% to 7.0%0.2% ( p<0.01 ) . both fasting glucose levels and the postprandial glucose response were decreased at 1  week after implantation and remained decreased at 24  weeks . in parallel , the glucagon , glucagon - like peptide 1 , and glucose - dependent insulinotropic hormone responses decreased and insulin levels did not change significantly . mathus - vliegen and de groot   have studied the effects of a balloon in 42 patients . in group 1 , basal cholecystokinin ( cck ) levels decreased but meal - stimulated responses remained unchanged after 13 weeks of sham treatment . in group 2 , basal and meal - stimulated cck levels decreased after 13 weeks of balloon treatment . at the end of the second 13-week period , when group 1 had their first balloon treatment , they duplicated the initial 13-week results of group 2 , whereas group 2 continued their balloon treatment and reduced meal - stimulated cck release . both groups showed reduced meal - stimulated pancreatic polypeptide ( pp ) secretions at t1 and t2 compared to t0 .

( 1 ) the ethical frame should be kept in mind all along . according to the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery , the implementation of such new devices should be limited to clinical trials and peer - reviewed protocols . ( 2 ) for the time being , most of the current techniques that fit into this description have rather short - term effects , which are strongly influenced by external factors in a much more important way than regular bariatric surgeries . atypical weight - loss trajectories may be observed more often in minimally invasive methods that achieve less important weight - loss . short - term effects may be described under the term  micro - trajectories  : 3- to 6-month periods are commonly analyzed in this field versus 1 year - period in typical surgical procedures . the existence of an  on - off  pattern ( the device being active or not for a variable duration ) makes it more complex to analyze weight - loss curves . such an effect can be observed in typical surgical procedures as well ( e.g. , gastric banding , gastric neuro - stimulation ) . paradoxically , weight - loss may be de - connected to the  on - off  pattern in some cases ; for instance , some patients continue losing weight when a balloon has been removed . can we define the causes of atypical trajectories ( possibly control effects , center effects , or behavioral effects ) ? caution is in order when evaluating the benefits of a given technique and its safety profile , and when designing the methods for rcts of obesity treatment . most minimally invasive or endoscopic techniques for obesity treatment are not ready for prime time and require more observational or randomized studies , at least concerning primary procedures . however , they are already being successful as re - do procedures in cases of surgical failure . a time - frame for step - strategies can be defined , allowing better long - term results and a favorable risk / benefit ratio . one must advise caution and warn that re - do after endoscopic techniques might be more difficult than anticipated . keeping in mind a  bariatric schedule  and the necessity of experimenting with combinations , we assume that one success among some of the current devices that are being developed and tried could change our expectations , and attract investors .","endoscopic procedures have been well - documented in the obesity field , but have not yet reached a sufficient level of evidence as stand - alone methods for treating obesity . 
 it is unclear if they should take over . 
 although expanding , the array of bariatric surgical techniques does not fully meet the current needs , and there are not enough resources for increasing surgery . 
 surgery is avoided by a majority of patients , so that less aggressive procedures are necessary . for the time being , relevant endoscopic methods include intra - gastric balloons , gastric partitioning ( endo - plication ) , and the metabolic field ( endo - barrier ) . 
 surgical novelties and basic research are also important contributors owing to their potential combination with endoscopy . 
 conditions have been listed for implementation of bariatric endoscopy , because innovation is risky , expensive , and faces ethical challenges . 
 a scientific background is being built ( e.g. , hormonal studies ) .

"acute embolic limb ischemia is an urgent clinical condition in which sudden decrease or worsening in limb perfusion causes a potential threat to extremity viability and to life . thorough removal of all occlusive emboli in the arterial tree results in the best outcomes ; hence , some authors favored arteriography after embolectomy for lower limbs . angiography is traditionally performed with iodinated contrast material , but carbon dioxide ( co2 ) has been studied as an alternative intravascular contrast agent for patients with iodine allergy or renal function impairment . since it is not nephrotoxic , it was considered reasonable to utilize this contrast in a patient with borderline renal function who would be submitted to the noxious stimuli of the reperfused limb after revascularization . 
  to the best of our knowledge , this was the first case assessing the intraoperative use of co2 as a substitute for iodine contrast in a patient with known chronic kidney disease and an acute ischemic limb . a 79-year - old woman presented to the emergency department with acute limb ischemia in her left leg with a 2-hour history . past medical history was positive for hypertension , atrial fibrillation and non - dialysis - dependent chronic renal failure . two years before , she had been operated on for acute aortic embolic occlusion , with bilateral femoral catheter embolectomy . upon discharge she presented pedal pulses , but no posterior tibial pulses on either limb . medication use was irregular , and her international normalized ratio ( inr ) of prothrombin time upon admission was 1.1 . her pulse was arrhythmic ; she was hypertensive ( 160x110mmhg ) and presented with normal femoral , popliteal and pedal pulses on her right leg . on palpation in the left lower limb only a weak femoral pulse was observed ; there were no distal pulses . she was classified as grade iib limb ischemia ( immediately threatened ) and was immediately referred for surgery . preoperative exams revealed a diminished creatinine clearance ( cockroft - gault of 12ml / min ) . arteriotomy was performed and a 4-fr embolectomy catheter was utilized ( edwards lifesciences corp , irvine , california , usa ) . the catheter progressed more than 60 cm on the superficial artery , but could not be felt neither on pedal artery topography nor on posterior tibial artery topography . back bleeding was not significant , and a decision was made to perform an angiography to better assess the infra - popliteal arterial tree . a homemade water seal co2 delivery system was used , similar to another previously described , but with one modification to prevent room - air contamination . bloomington , indianopolis , usa ) inserted in the arteriotomy while the arteries were clamped . figure 1 shows a patent popliteal artery , a patent fibular artery and an occlusion on the mid - third of the anterior tibial artery . we hypothesized that the embolectomy catheter reached the fibular artery on the first attempt , and thus could not be felt on physical exam . patent popliteal and fibular arteries , occlusion in the mid - third of the anterior tibial artery 
  a new embolectomy was then performed . the catheter progressed to the foot , on the topography of the pedal artery ( i.e. , the catheter could be felt on the projection of the artery ) , and more thrombi were retrieved . control angiography ( figure 2 ) showed complete resolution of the anterior tibial artery occlusion , with contrast up to the foot ( figure 3 ) . a total of 28ml of co2 was used , and no iodine contrast was needed . the arteries were unclamped , and the popliteal and pedal pulses were noted to be present on the limb . ischemia signs ( e.g. , pallor , hypothermia ) were promptly resolved after arterial flow release . the patient remained in the intensive care unit ( icu ) until the 11 postoperative day . during this period , the patient did not receive any nephrotoxic agent , such as vancomycin or vasoactive drugs . after icu discharge she developed a urinary tract infection , as well as deteriorating renal function and uremia . the patient developed pneumonia , which progressed to septic shock on the 36 day of her admission . she required vasoactive drugs for 2 days at the icu and , unfortunately , her renal function was never fully recovered . she was discharged from hospital to a hospice care facility with a pedal pulse and no deficit on her limb , though requiring chronic dialysis . treatment of embolic arterial occlusion with severe limb ischemia is well defined and involves the use of an embolectomy catheter as the best alternative . co2 has been used electively in both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the femoropopliteal tree , and is reported to be safe and non - nephrotoxic . intraoperative angiography was beneficial because it allowed the diagnosis of the arterial tree occlusion after the initial embolectomy . additional removal of clots was performed and the result was documented as complete patency of the anterior tibial artery to the foot . our goal , when using co2 , was to decrease the need for postoperative dialysis . probably , in this case , the deleterious stimuli ( surgical stress , urinary tract infection and septic shock due to pneumonia ) contributed to renal failure and subsequent need for dialysis . the countermeasure ( such as the use of non - nephrotoxic contrast ) if we had used the iodinated medium , we might wonder if something could have been done differently to avoid dialysis . we consider co2 to be an alternative to iodine contrast when the decision to perform angiography is made in the acutely ischemic limb . to the best of our knowledge , this agent has never been described in this clinical setting ; it presents good quality imaging , is not nephrotoxic and does not increase the risk for the limb or the patient in acute arterial occlusions . this approach may prove to be fruitful in patients with borderline renal function , thereby reducing the risk of short or long - term need for dialysis . a isquemia aguda de membro de origem emblica  uma situao clnica de carter urgente , em que ocorre uma diminuio ou piora sbita na perfuso de um membro , e configura um risco  viabilidade da extremidade e  vida . o tratamento consiste em revascularizao imediata com um cateter de embolectomia . a remoo completa de todos os mbolos oclusivos na rvore arterial leva aos melhores desfechos ; por isso , alguns autores defendem a arteriografia aps a embolectomia , para os membros inferiores . 
  a angiografia  tradicionalmente realizada com contraste iodado , mas o dixido de carbono ( co2 ) foi estudado como um agente de contraste intravascular alternativo para pacientes com alergia a iodo ou alterao na funo renal . como o co2 no  nefrotxico , julgou - se razovel utilizar esse contraste em uma paciente com funo renal limtrofe ( borderline ) que seria submetida aos estmulos nocivos de reperfuso do membro , aps a revascularizao . em nosso entender , este foi o primeiro caso que avalia o uso intraoperatrio de co2 como um substituto de contraste iodado em um paciente com doena renal crnica conhecida e isquemia aguda de membro . paciente do sexo feminino , 79 anos , chegou ao pronto - socorro com isquemia aguda no membro inferior esquerdo , com durao de 2 horas . como antecedentes , apresentava hipertenso , fibrilao atrial e insuficincia renal crnica , no dependente de dilise . a paciente tinha sido operada 2 anos antes , por ocluso artica aguda de origem emblica , quando foi realizada embolectomia femoral bilateral com cateter . alta , os pulsos pediosos eram palpveis , mas os tibiais posteriores eram ausentes , bilateralmente . a paciente fazia uso irregular dos medicamentos , e o tempo de protrombina ( inr , sigla do ingls international normalized ratio ) era de 1,1 . o pulso estava arrtmico ; era hipertensa ( 160x110mmhg ) e apresentava pulsos femoral , poplteo e distal normais , na perna direita . palpao do membro inferior esquerdo , havia apenas um pulso femoral fraco ; os pulsos distais estavam ausentes . a paciente apresentava dor e dfice motor . ela foi considerada como portadora de isquemia de membro grau iib ( risco eminente ) e foi encaminhada imediatamente para cirurgia . o clearance de creatinina estava diminudo nos exames pr - operatrios ( cockroft - gault de 12ml / min ) . sob anestesia geral , foi realizado acesso femoral na cicatriz da inciso anterior do membro inferior esquerdo . as artrias femorais comum , superficial e profunda foram dissecadas e clampeadas . foi feita arteriotomia e uso de cateter de embolectomia de 4fr ( edwards lifesciences corp , irvine , califrnia , estados unidos ) . os trombos foram removidos das artrias femorais superficial e profunda . o cateter avanou mais de 60 cm na artria femoral superficial , mas no pde ser palpado . o fluxo retrgrado no foi significativo e decidiu - se realizar uma angiografia para avaliar melhor a rvore arterial infrapopltea . foi escolhido o co2 como substituto ao contraste iodado para a angiografia . utilizou - se um sistema home - made com fornecimento de co2 em selo dgua , semelhante a outro descrito anteriormente , mas com uma modificao para evitar a contaminao do ar ambiente . bloomington , indianpolis , estados unidos ) inserido na arteriotomia , quando as artrias foram pinadas . a figura 1 mostra uma artria popltea e uma fibular prvias , e uma ocluso no tero mdio da artria tibial anterior . levantamos a hiptese de o cateter de embolectomia ter alcanado a artria fibular na primeira tentativa , e por isso no ter sido palpvel ao exame fsico . artrias popltea e fibular prvias , ocluso no tero mdio da artria tibial anterior

  a angiografia intraoperatria foi benfica , j que permitiu o diagnstico de ocluso da rvore arterial aps a primeira embolectomia . mais cogulos foram removidos , e o resultado documentado foi a permeabilidade completa da artria tibial anterior at o p . nosso objetivo , ao utilizar co2 , foi o de diminuir a necessidade de dilise no ps - operatrio . neste caso , provavelmente , os estmulos prejudiciais ( estresse cirrgico , infeco do trato urinrio e choque sptico por pneumonia ) contriburam para a insuficincia renal e para consequente necessidade de dilise . a contramedida ( como o uso de contraste no nefrotxico ) poderia ter prevenido a insuficincia renal , se fosse esta uma situao nica . se tivssemos usado o contraste iodado , pensaramos se algo diferente poderia ter sido feito para evitar dilise . consideramos o co2 como uma alternativa ao contraste iodado quando  necessria a angiografia para isquemia aguda de membro . em nosso entender , esse agente nunca foi descrito nessa situao clnica , proporcionando boa qualidade de imagem , no sendo nefrotxico , nem aumentado o risco do membro ou do paciente , em casos de ocluses arteriais agudas . essa abordagem pode se mostrar til em pacientes com funo renal limtrofe ( borderline ) , reduzindo , assim , o risco de precisar de dilise a curto ou longo prazo .","acute limb ischemia can be potentially harmful to the limb and life threatening .

"recent research indicates that at least one - third of us adults report regularly getting less than the 79 hours of sleep per night recommended by the national sleep foundation . insufficient sleep , variably defined , has been associated with health - risk behaviors , such as smoking [ 2 , 3 ] , alcohol use [ 2 , 3 ] , and with adverse health outcomes such as obesity , and frequent mental distress ( fmd ) ( 14 days / past 30 days in which respondents report their mental health was not good ) . noting that the average sleep duration among us adults has decreased during the past 50 years along with a concomitant increase in the prevalence of obesity , wheaton et al .   found a strong positive relationship between perceived insufficient sleep and body mass index ( bmi ) among community - dwelling adults . given the linkage between insufficient sleep and increased bmi , the association between insufficient sleep and diabetes   is not surprising . consistent with these findings , sleep restriction ( defined as 5 hours / night for one week ) was found to be associated with a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity . notably , the prevalence of several factors associated with insufficient sleep has been reported to vary between different race / ethnicities in large epidemiologic studies . specifically , an analysis of 20062008 bmi data from the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey ( brfss ) revealed prevalences of obesity of 23.7% among non - hispanic whites ( nhw ) , 35.7% among non - hispanic blacks although ai / an were not specifically delineated in the latter survey , rates of obesity in ai / an adults have been reported to be 1.5 times greater than among nhw adults . similarly , aggregated prevalences ( 19992004 ) of diagnosed diabetes reported from the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) were 5.9% among nhw , 11.1% among nhb , and 10.9% among mexican americans . an analysis of data from both the brfss and the indian health service across 19942002 revealed that the age - adjusted prevalence of diabetes among ai / an adults was more than twice that of us adults overall .   despite the relatively high prevalence of factors associated with insufficient sleep in ai / an , few epidemiologic investigations of insufficient sleep have been conducted in this population . in investigations delineating race / ethnicity disparities , short sleep duration ( average 6 hours/24-hour period ) among workers was reported significantly more frequently by nhb ( 38.9% ) , nh other ( 35.3% ) , and nh asian ( 33.2% ) than among nhw ( 28.6% ) or hispanic ( 28.8% ) . in related research using nhanes 20052008 data to assess sleep - related difficulties ( e.g. , concentrating , remembering , driving , and working ) , nhb reported a greater prevalence of sleep - related difficulties in driving or taking public transportation ( 14.8% ) than the other racial / ethnic populations studied ( nhw , mexican americans , and others ) . similarly , reporting 30 days of insufficient sleep or rest was significantly more prevalent among nhb ( 13.3% ) than nhw ( 11.2% ) 2008 brfss respondents . it is worthy of note that because of small sample sizes of ai / an in national surveillance systems , ai / an are often categorized as others ,  thus rendering it difficult to ascertain the prevalence of sleep sufficiency and risk factors in this population . as many risk factors associated with frequent insufficient sleep appear to be of increased prevalence in ai / an , we sought to determine the prevalence of insufficient sleep in a community - based sample of this population . specifically , to examine if ai / an are more likely to experience insufficient sleep relative to nhw , as has already been reported among nhb , we aggregate data from the 2009 and 2010 brfss . furthermore , we assess the impact of recognized sleep correlates ( i.e. , socioeconomic indicators , lifestyle behaviors , obesity , age , and fmd ) on potential race / ethnicity disparities in insufficient sleep . data were obtained from the recent brfss , a large , random - digit - dialed telephone survey conducted in all 50 states , the district of columbia , and us territories . the 2009 - 2010 brfss collected data on health - related behaviors , including sleep , smoking , physical inactivity , binge drinking , obesity , and frequent mental distress among the us civilian population aged 18 years living in households with landline telephones . as previously noted , we combined 2009 and 2010 brfss data in order to yield an adequate sample size of ai / an . before aggregating these data , we observed no difference between 2009 and 2010 in frequent insufficient sleep , defined as 14 days / past 30 days in which respondents reported that they did not get enough rest or sleep . additionally , the two years shared a similar median response rate to the question assessing frequent insufficient sleep ( 52.5% and 54.6% , respectively ) ( brfss 2009 and 2010 summary quality report , version 1 , revised on 2/18/2011 for 2009 and on 5/2/2011 for 2011 ) . a detailed description of the brfss survey design , data collection techniques , and the full - text questionnaire can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss . data were obtained from 810,168 respondents ( 96.9% ) who self - identified as nhw , ( n = 671,448 ) , nhb ( n = 67,685 ) , hispanic ( n = 59,528 ) , or ai / an ( n = 11,507 ) after excluding respondents who had missing data on the insufficient sleep question ( n = 15,322 ) and other variables of interest ( n = 25,636 ) . all respondents were asked ,  during the past 30 days , for about how many days have you felt you did not get enough rest or sleep ?  we defined frequent insufficient sleep as 14 days , as this cutoff has been shown to have a strong relationship with the prevalence of chronic disease and health risk behaviors . sociodemographic characteristics included sex , age in years ( 1824 , 2534 , 3544 , 4554 , 5564 or 65 ) , years of education ( < 12 , 12 , or > 12 ) , and employment status ( employed for wage / self - employed , unemployed , retired , unable to work , or homemaker / student ) . health - related lifestyle behaviors included smoking status ( current smoker , former smoker , or never smoked ) , binge drinking ( for men , 5 alcoholic beverages on one occasion in the previous 30 days ; for women , 4 alcoholic beverages on one occasion in the previous 30 days ) , and physical inactivity ( respondent indicated  no  to the question ,  during the past month , other than your regular job , did you participate in any physical activities or exercising such as running , calisthenics , golf , gardening , or walking for exercise ?  ) . frequent mental distress ( fmd ) was defined as a response of 14 days to the question ,  now thinking about your mental health , which includes stress , depression , and problems with emotions , for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good ?  . assessment of obesity was based on the body mass index ( bmi , kg / m ) , calculated from respondents ' self - reported height in inches and weight in pounds ( obese : bmi 30  kg / m versus not obese : bmi < 30.0  kg / m ) . first , the racial / ethnic - specific distributions of the selected characteristics and frequent insufficient sleep were obtained in order to examine unadjusted race / ethnicity disparities . next , the prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep by race / ethnicity and groups defined by obesity , smoking , binge drinking , physical activity , and fmd status was calculated to demonstrate race / ethnicity - specific associations between these covariates and frequent insufficient sleep . we used multivariate logistic regression modeling to assess the race / ethnicity disparity in frequent insufficient sleep in separate models controlling first for age , then in a second model with the addition of sex , education , and employment , to which obesity was added to create a third model . a fourth model added smoking status , physical inactivity , and binge drinking to the third model , with a fifth model adding fmd . all analyses were conducted using sas - callable sudaan to account for the complex sampling design . ai / an had a higher proportion of male respondents than other racial / ethnicity groups . relative to nhw , we found that nhb , hispanics , and ai / an tended to be younger , to report < 12 years of education and were more likely to be unemployed or to report being unable to work ( p  0.01 ) . in addition , nhb , ai / an , and hispanics were more likely to be obese relative to nhw ( p  0.01 ) and , concomitantly , to report they were physically inactive ( p  0.001 ) . ai / an were more likely to report being current ( 33.2% ) or former ( 25.7% ) smokers than any of the other race / ethnicity groups examined . binge drinking was similar in all race / ethnicity groups except among nhb who were less likely to report binge drinking . table 1 also indicates that the unadjusted prevalence of fmd was significantly greater ( p  0.001 ) among ai / an than any other race / ethnicity group . most notably , we found significantly higher unadjusted prevalences ( 95% confidence interval [ 95% ci ] ) of frequent insufficient sleep among ai / an ( 34.2% [ 32.136.4 ] ) and nhb ( 29.4% [ 28.630.1 ] ) and a significantly lower prevalence among hispanics ( 25.4% [ 24.726.1 ] ) compared to nhw ( 27.4% [ 27.127.6 ] ) .  
 table 2 lists the race / ethnicity - specific prevalences of frequent insufficient sleep by selected characteristics . obese respondents had a statistically higher prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep than nonobese respondents among all race / ethnicities , excepting ai / an . regardless of race / ethnicity , current smokers were more likely to report frequent insufficient sleep than former smokers or never smokers ( p  0.01 ) . a higher prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep among binge drinkers compared to nonbinge drinkers reached statistical significance only among nhw and nhb ( p  0.01 ) . a positive relationship between physical inactivity and frequent insufficient sleep was observed regardless of race / ethnicity ( p  0.01 ) . persons reporting fmd were significantly more likely to report frequent insufficient sleep than those without fmd in all race / ethnicity groups ( p  0.001 ) . results from our adjusted multivariate logistic regression models comparing the likelihood of frequent insufficient sleep among nhb , hispanics , and ai / an relative to frequent insufficient sleep in nhw are shown in table 3 . after age adjustment ( model 1 ) the disparity in frequent insufficient sleep between nhw and nhb ( pr = 1.02 ; 95% ci : 0.991.04 ) was no longer statistically significant . however , both nhb ( pr = 0.95 ; 95% ci : 0.920.98 ) and hispanics ( pr = 0.84 ; 95% ci : 0.810.86 ) remained significantly less likely ( p  0.001 ) to report frequent insufficient sleep than nhw , even after controlling for all the covariates in the model ( model 5 ) .  
 table 3 also reveals a significant age - adjusted excess prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep in ai / an relative to nhw in model 1 , ( pr = 1.20 ; 95% ci : 1.121.27 ) . this was modestly weakened by the addition of sex , education , and employment ( pr = 1.12 ; 95% ci : 1.041.19 ) as indicated by model 2 . this relationship was further attenuated in ai / an by the separate addition of obesity in model 3 ( pr = 1.10 ; 95% ci : 1.031.18 ) , and then by the addition of smoking , physical inactivity , and binge drinking ( pr = 1.08 ; 95% ci : 1.011.16 ) in model 4 . finally , the disparity in frequent insufficient sleep was no longer significant after adding fmd in model 5 ( pr = 1.05 ; 95% ci : 0.991.13 ) . this is the first investigation to document the excess prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep among ai / an relative to other race / ethnicity groups . over 34% of ai / an reported frequent insufficient sleep 14 days in the past month in contrast to 29% of nhb , 27% of nhw , and 25% of hispanics . the disparity in frequent insufficient sleep prevalence between ai / an and nhw remained even after we adjusted for recognized sleep correlates that included sociodemographic characteristics , lifestyle behaviors , and obesity . however , we also found that this disparity was attributable , in part , to the relatively high rate of fmd in the ai / an population . notably , previous sleep research in this population has largely been limited to the identification of factors associated with the increased prevalence of sudden infant death syndrome [ 1618 ] and has documented the prevalence of sleep disturbance among ai / an veterans .   other research on sleep health in ai / an suggests possible implications of the results of the present investigation . specifically , noting that cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) is the leading cause of death among ai / an , sabanayagam et al . assessed both symptoms of insomnia  including short sleep duration  and self - reported cvd among 449 ai / an aged 55 years of age in the native elder care study . notably , these investigators found that relative to participants reporting a 7-hour sleep duration , the multivariable odds ratio for cvd of those with a sleep duration 5 hours was 2.89 ( 95% ci : 1.177.16 ) , after adjusting for demographic , lifestyle , and clinical factors . these results suggest that the excess insufficient sleep documented in the present investigation could manifest itself in the increased risk for cvd - related morbidity and mortality in the ai / an population . in a review of the literature metabolic cost ,  and triggers a cascade of metabolic , neuroendocrine , and behavioral changes designed to increase food consumption and decrease energy expenditure , thereby giving rise to obesity . the excess insufficient sleep observed in this study may thus underlie findings indicating that ai / an are at increased risk of obesity relative to other race / ethnicity groups [ 2325 ] . furthermore , as diabetes is associated with obesity [ 2629 ] , our findings may describe a heretofore unrecognized risk factor underlying the increased rate of diabetes among ai / an [ 3032 ] . first , our measure of frequent insufficient sleep was based on subjective self - report and is not corroborated by actigraphy or polysomnography . second , the wording of the insufficient sleep question includes both the terms  rest  and  sleep ,  thereby being potentially subject to varying interpretations among respondents . third , our sample is limited to only households with landline telephones and to respondents residing in noninstitutionalized settings ; thus , our findings may not be generalizable to the overall us population . our finding of excess insufficient sleep among ai / an thus appears to confirm the importance of sleep health to chronic disease prevention and health promotion in this population . specifically , assessment of sleep sufficiency appears particularly germane to healthcare providers serving this population , as well as to public health messaging targeting sleep health ( including sleep correlates ) in ai / an communities . available interventions designed to promote awareness of the importance of sufficient sleep include a  summary for patients  describing the influence of both diet and sufficient sleep on efforts to lose weight , as well as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia [ 34 , 35 ] , with the latter improving both subjective and objective sleep quality , as measured by polysomnography . finally , as fmd appears associated with frequent insufficient sleep among ai / an , mental health assessment and intervention emerge as important components in the evaluation of insufficient sleep in this population .","objective . frequent insufficient sleep , defined as 14 days / past 30 days in which an adult did not get enough rest or sleep , is associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes .

 methods . 
 we assessed racial / ethnic differences in the prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep from the combined 2009 - 2010 behavioral risk factor surveillance survey among 810,168 respondents who self - identified as non - hispanic white ( nhw , n = 671,448 ) , non - hispanic black ( nhb , n = 67,685 ) , hispanic ( 
 n = 59,528 ) , or ai / an ( n = 11,507 ) . results . 
 we found significantly higher unadjusted prevalences ( 95% ci ) of frequent insufficient sleep among ai / an ( 34.2% [ 32.136.4 ] ) compared to nhw ( 27.4% [ 27.127.6 ] ) . 
 however , the age - adjusted excess prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep in ai / an compared to nhw was decreased but remained significant with the addition of sex , education , and employment status ; this latter relationship was further attenuated by the separate additions of obesity and lifestyle indicators , but was no longer significant with the addition of frequent mental distress to the model ( pr  =  1.05 ; 95% ci  :  0.991.13 ) . 
 this is the first report of a high prevalence of frequent insufficient sleep among ai / an . 
 these results further suggest that investigation of sleep health interventions addressing frequent mental distress may benefit ai / an populations .",358
"mammography is the primary imaging modality for the early detection of breast cancer . despite advances in mammographic techniques ( digital ) , mammography still has its limitations with regard to both sensitivity ( 65.685.5% ) and specificity ( 87.794.3% ) . mammograms are coded using the ordered categories of the american college of radiology ( acr ) breast imaging reporting and data system ( bi - rads ) lexicon : category 1 , negative ; 2 , benign finding ; 3 , probably benign ; 4 , suspicious finding ; 5 , highly suggestive of malignancy . the diagnostic work - up of breast lesions depends on the bi - rads classification of the breast lesions . the guideline for non - invasive diagnostic tests for breast abnormalities of the agency for health care research and quality in the united states ( ahrq ) states that breast lesions classified as bi - rads 1 and 2 require no further work - up or follow - up other than routinely called for . the chance of a bi - rads 4 lesion being malignant varies from 2% to 95% , whereas this chance is over 95% for a bi - rads 5 lesion . this biopsy procedure can not be replaced by breast magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , because histology is obligatory in these cases . the most difficult mammographic lesions are the lesions that are classified as bi - rads 3 . the probability of a bi - rads 3 lesion being cancer is considered to be less than 2% . for the work - up of a bi - rads 3 lesion , biopsy or follow - up , the decision on the work - up of bi - rads 3 lesions depends on the possibilities for biopsy procedures , the wishes of the patient and the preference of the radiologist . most patients who are referred for a biopsy have benign disease because of the low predictive value of both physical examination and mammography . the value of breast mri in bi - rads 3 lesions is not yet clear . breast mri is emerging as a clinically useful additional diagnostic tool and has an excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value ( npv ) , which usually exceeds 90% . the diagnostic accuracy of breast mri varies with the expertise of the radiologist and the particular patient population studied . it is important that breast mri is used for those groups of patients for whom there is evidence of acceptable diagnostic accuracy . breast mri as a first - line imaging modality is performed by screening women at increased risk for breast cancer . as a second - line modality , breast mri can be used for the following indications : inconclusive findings in conventional imaging , preoperative staging , axillary node malignancy and unknown site of primary tumor , the evaluation of therapy response in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting , imaging of the breast after conservative therapy , prosthesis imaging , nipple discharge and mr - guided biopsy and lesion localization . although the npv of mri in breast cancer is the highest of all imaging techniques and in most cases a negative breast mri excludes malignancy , it is not yet common practice to use breast mri as a problem - solving modality in excluding patients for further diagnostic work - up . therefore , in this meta - analysis , the usefulness of breast mri as a problem - solving modality in patients with mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions is investigated . a computerized search was performed to identify relevant studies in medline and embase up to 2010 . the following strategy was followed in medline :  magnetic resonance imaging  [ mesh term ] or  magnetic resonance imaging  [ text word ] or  mri  [ text word ] or mr imaging  [ text word ] and  probably benign lesions  [ text word ] or  microcalcifications  [ text word ] or  inconclusive findings  [ text word ] and mammography [ mesh term ] or mammography [ text word ] and  sensitivity and specificity  [ mesh term ] or  specificity or sensitivity  [ text word ] . in embase medline and embase were searched for studies that used breast mri as a problem - solving modality in mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions . studies were included if the following inclusion criteria were met : ( 1 ) all patients underwent a mammography and breast mri ; ( 2 ) the study population had mammographic bi -

rads 3 by mammography in 43 patients . the 56 mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions were distributed into non - calcified regular - shaped lesions ( 64.3% ) , focal asymmetric densities ( 21.4% ) , generalized microcalcifications ( 12.6% ) and a cluster of tiny calcifications ( 1.7% ) . the sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , ppv and npv of mri in the determination of malignancy in these mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions were calculated as 100% , 96.4% , 96.4% , 33.3% and 100% , respectively . concluded that mri may be helpful in the evaluation of focal asymmetric densities as mri confirmed that 9 of the 12 mammographic focal asymmetric densities were breast tissue and the other 3 were masses . another study evaluated the usefulness of breast mri in cases of inconclusive mammographic or sonographic findings . in this study , not only mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions ( n  =  15 ) were included but also bi - rads 4 lesions ( n  =  22 ) and mammographic bi - rads 0 lesions ( n  =  78 ) . in total , 115 breast mri scans were used as an adjunctive tool and the findings were correlated with pathology . the equivocal mammographic findings for which mri was performed were asymmetry without associated microcalcifications ( 85.2% ) , architectural distortion ( 10.4% ) and change in the appearance of the site of a previous benign biopsy finding ( 4.3% ) . mri had a sensitivity of 100% , npv of 100% and compared with mammography had significantly higher specificity ( 91.7% versus 80.7% , p  =  0.029 ) , ppv ( 40% vs 8.7% , p  =  0.032 ) , and overall accuracy ( 92.2% vs 78.3% , p  =  0.00052 ) . concluded that breast mri can be a useful adjunctive tool when equivocal findings at conventional mammography are asymmetry or architectural distortion . three published studies evaluated the role of mri in patients with mammographic bi - rads 3 microcalcifications . also included mammographic bi - rads 4 microcalcifications and cilotti et al . and uetmatsu et al . included mammographic bi - rads 4 and 5 microcalcifications . in the study of akita et al . the clinical value of additional breast mri in patients with microcalcifications on mammography and negative ultrasound findings was evaluated . fifty patients with mammographic microcalcifications ( 9 bi - rads category 3 and 41 bi - rads category 4 ) were included . mammography had a sensitivity of 100% , a specificity of 24% and an accuracy of 44% , whereas mammography plus mri had a sensitivity of 85% , a specificity of 100% and an accuracy of 96% . they concluded that breast mri significantly improved the rate of diagnosis of malignancy in breast lesions that were detected as mammographic bi - rads 3 or 4 microcalcifications compared with mammography alone . in the study of uematsu et al . , breast mri was performed in 100 microcalcifications detected at screening mammography in 96 patients . ppvs and npvs were calculated on the basis of a bi - rads category and the absence or presence of contrast uptake in the area of microcalcifications . npv of bi - rads mammography 3 was 93% versus 97% npv of mri ( p  =  0.167 ) . the ppv of contrast uptake of mri was 86% , which is significantly higher than the 67% ppv of bi - rads mammography 4 and 5 ( p  =  0.033 ) . concluded that the imperfect ppvs and npvs of mri in the evaluation of microcalcifications detected at screening can not replace stereotactic vacuum - assisted biopsy . concluded that the ppv and npv of mri in the characterization of microcalcifications are not high . in their study , 55 patients with mammographic calcifications classified as bi - rads categories 3 , 4 or 5 underwent mri and stereotactic vacuum - assisted biopsy . the sensitivity , specificity , ppv , npv and diagnostic accuracy were 73% , 76% , 73% , 76% and 74.5% , respectively . their conclusion is that mri can not be considered a diagnostic tool for evaluating microcalcifications . in one study , the role of mri in the evaluation of mammographic bi -

rads mammography 4 and 5 ( p  =  0.033 ) . uematsu et al . concluded that the imperfect ppvs and npvs of mri in the evaluation of microcalcifications detected at screening can not replace stereotactic vacuum - assisted biopsy . concluded that the ppv and npv of mri in the characterization of microcalcifications are not high . in their study , 55 patients with mammographic calcifications classified as bi - rads categories 3 , 4 or 5 underwent mri and stereotactic vacuum - assisted biopsy . the sensitivity , specificity , ppv , npv and diagnostic accuracy were 73% , 76% , 73% , 76% and 74.5% , respectively . their conclusion is that mri can not be considered a diagnostic tool for evaluating microcalcifications . the ahrq guideline states that the work - up for mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions should be biopsy or follow - up imaging after 6 months . there is not yet a role for breast mri , because ultrasonography- or mammography - guided core or vacuum biopsy can obtain histological proof of a bi - rads 3 lesion . a variety of minimally invasive procedures are widely available , relatively safe , inexpensive and provide a diagnosis without surgical intervention . furthermore , breast mri has its limitations , which include higher costs , longer examination time , and lower availability compared with mammography and ultrasound . if breast mri is to be an effective addition to the work - up of a mammographic bi - rads 3 lesion , the npv of breast mri must be sufficiently high to definitively rule out further work - up with biopsy . although there were only 5 studies that investigated the usefulness of mri as a problem - solving modality in mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions , the npv was 100% in non - calcified mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions and 7697% in mammographic bi - rads 3 microcalcifications . on the other hand , kuhl indicated that the evidence for the effectiveness of breast mri is relatively weak in helping to solve mammographic problems , because in a multicenter trial of bluemke et al . the npv was not high enough to exclude malignancy with sufficient confidence in the case of an equivocal or suspicious lesion seen at conventional imaging . the diagnostic accuracy of mri was studied in 821 patients with a suspicious mammographic bi - rads 4 or 5 lesion ( 85% ) or a suspicious clinical finding with a negative or benign conventional work - up ( 15% ) before biopsy . mri had an npv of 85% with cancer missed in 48 of 329 negative mri examinations . this npv is not sufficiently high to avoid biopsy in suspicious mammographic bi - rads 4 or 5 lesions . this widely referenced multicenter study was performed in 14 hospitals from 1998 to 2001 and therefore used now outdated mr equipment . furthermore , the study of bluemke et al . included patients with microcalcifications of the breast , which have a negative influence on the npv . in this meta - analysis , 3 studies assessed the role of mri in mammographic bi - rads 3 microcalcifications . therefore , mri can not be implemented as a problem - solving modality in mammographic microcalcifications at this time . mri can be useful as an additional tool in patients with calcifications ; it can be helpful in demonstrating or excluding underlying invasive cancer , because mri has a high npv for invasive cancer . an important application of mri in patients with associated with suspicious microcalcifications could be to evaluate disease extension . however , the studies that comply with the inclusion criteria of the meta - analysis , i.e. non - calcified mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions , reported an npv of 100% and concluded that mri can be a useful tool in mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions , especially when mammographic findings are asymmetry or architectural distortion . although there are sparse data , the first solid data indicate that breast mri might be useful as a problem - solving modality to exclude patients with non - calcified mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions from further diagnostic work - up .","abstractthe probability of a mammographic breast imaging reporting and data system ( bi - rads ) 3 lesion being cancer is considered to be less than 2% . 
 therefore , the work - up of a mammographic bi - rads 3 lesion should be biopsy or follow - up mammography after 6 months . however , most patients referred for biopsy have benign disease . although the negative predictive value ( npv ) of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is highest of all imaging techniques , it is not yet common practice to use breast mri as a problem - solving modality to exclude patients for further diagnostic work - up . therefore , in this meta - analysis the usefulness of breast mri as a problem - solving modality in mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions is investigated . after a systematic search only 5 out of 61 studies met the inclusion criteria . 
 the npv in 2 of those studies was reported to be 100% . 
 it was concluded that mri can be used as an adjunctive tool to mammographic bi - rads 3 findings to exclude patients for further diagnostic work - up . 
 the other 3 studies assessed the accuracy of mri in mammographic bi - rads 3 microcalcifications . 
 these studies reported an npv of mri between 76% and 97% . 
 therefore , mri can not be implemented as a diagnostic tool to evaluate mammographic microcalcifications at this time . 
 the first solid data indicate that breast mri might be useful as a problem - solving modality to exclude patients with non - calcified mammographic bi - rads 3 lesions for further diagnostic work - up . 
 however , further research is needed to verify these results .",353
"cervical infection by one of approximately 15 high - risk hpv types is generally accepted as the necessary causative agent of cervical cancer [ 1 , 2 ] . the upper aerodigestive tract , including the oral cavity , the pharynx , and the larynx , is also lined by a squamous mucous membrane and because of the morphological similarities and epitheliotropic nature of hpv , a link between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) and hpv seems logical . hnscc is usually etiologically linked to tobacco and/or alcohol or other lifestyle habits , but a minority of patients develop hnscc in the absence of exposure to these factors or any other obvious predisposing genetic defect . several investigators have reported detection of hpv infection in healthy oral mucosa as well as in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity ( oscc ) and oropharynx ( opscc ) [ 4 , 5 ] , which are related to sexual behaviour and younger age . hpv has shown to have a predilection for certain , especially nonkeratinized , anatomical sites of the oropharynx . high - risk hpv types , such as hpv 16 , have been detected even in clinically normal oropharyngeal mucosa . in the cervix , the persistence of hpv infection may increase the likelihood of viral integration and concomitant deregulation of viral protein expression , leading to overexpression of e6/e7 oncoproteins [ 7 , 8 ] . in oral cancers the integration of hpv dna into the host 's cell genome is probably a less common event . various hpv types have been identified in patients with oral cancer , but clinical and case control studies have not proved a causal relationship between the virus and oral carcinomas beyond any reasonable doubt [ 8 , 9 , 11 ] . hpv dna detection alone is regarded as insufficient evidence for a causal role in oral cells transformation and is more like a secondary invader [ 7 , 10 ] . hpv integration into the host cell genome however , is a causal factor in head and neck carcinogenesis [ 1113 ] . in many reports , in which the hpv - positivity varies from 40 to 57% , there is no reference to the viral integration of the hpv positive samples [ 5 , 8 , 10 ] . the purpose of our study is to define hpv detection in patients with osccs and to evaluate the detection of e6/e7 high - risk hpv mrna as a possible biomarker for posttreatment surveillance . sixty - four ( 64 ) cytological samples were obtained from patients with hnscc of the oral cavity , ( 35 oral tongue , 8 maxilla , 4 mandible , 8 floor of mouth , 6 retromolar trigone , and 3 buccal mucosa ) who visited the outpatient clinic of the radiotherapy department of the regional anticancer oncology hospital  saint savvas  , athens , greece , between november 2008 and november 2011 . ethical approval was granted by the ethics committee of regional anticancer oncology hospital of athens  st . the samples were collected using a brush and swabbing the mouth , maxilla and mandible , oral tongue , and buccal mucosa and were preserved in thin prep ( preservcyt solution , hologic uk ) . cytological samples were transferred in lysis buffer ( nuclisens lysis buffer , biomrieux hellas s.a , cat no . 200292 ) for 30 minutes , then total nucleic acid was extracted by the offboard protocol with the nuclisens easymag platform ( biomrieux hellas s.a ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions . dna quality test was carried out using human globin , beta , primer set kit ( maxim biotech , inc . , south san francisco , ca , usa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions . to assess rna integrity , 5  g of rna per sample then , the papillocheck hpv - screening ( greiner , germany ) was used for the type - specific identification of 24 types of hpv ( 15 high - risk types : 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 68 , 73 , and 82 , probable high - risk types : 53 , 66 and 7 low - risk types : 6 , 11 , 40 , 42 , 43 , 44/55 , and 70 ) . this technology is based on a dna chip for the type - specific identification of 24 types of hpv . e1-based pcr was performed according to the manufacturer 's guidelines . for each sample , we mixed 19.8  l papillocheck mastermix , 0.2  l hotstartaq plus dna polymerase ( 5u/l , qiagen , cat no . hybridization is followed by mixing 30  l of the papillocheck hybridization buffer in a new reaction tube with 5  l of the pcr product at room temperature and transferring 25  l of the hybridization mix into each compartment of the chip . the chip was washed in 3 washing solutions , centrifuged for 3 minutes at 5000  rpm , and scanned on the checkscannertm . a commercial real - time nuclisens easyq assay ( nuclisens easyq hpv 1.1 , biomrieux hellas s.a , cat no . 290003 ) was performed for the qualitative detection of hpv e6/e7 mrna of five high - risk hpv types ( 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , and 45 ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . firstly , three premixes were made by adding reagent sphere diluent ( tris - hcl , 45% dmso ) into reagent spheres ( nucleotides , dithiotreitol , and mgcl2 ) . in each premix , we added u1a / hpv 16 , hpv 33/45 , or hpv 18/31 primer and molecular beacon mixes , kcl stock solution , and nasba water . secondly , 10  l of this premix was distributed to each well in a reaction plate , and the addition of 5  l rna followed . the plates were incubated for 4 minutes at 65c to destabilize secondary structures of rna , followed by cooling down to 41c . the reaction was started by addition of enzymes ( amv - rt , rnase h , t7 rna polymerase , and bovine serum albumin ) and measured in real time using the lambda fl 600 fluorescence reader ( bio - tek , winooski , vt ) at 41c for 2 hours and 30 minutes . following diagnosis and molecular analysis , patients with positive histology of hnscc of the oral cavity , with a karnofsky index ( ki )  70% , and with normal renal , hepatic and bone marrow function were included . baseline laboratories studies requirements included neutrophils greater than 1.5  10/l and platelets > 100  10/l . exclusion criteria were distant metastatic disease , a life expectancy of < 3 months , pregnancy , previous cancer disease within 5 years of study entry , existence of second primary tumor , and karnofsky index ( ki ) of < 70% . furthermore , patients with severe renal , liver , cardiovascular , or pulmonary diseases and patients with hematological malignancies were excluded . all participants underwent an extensive presurgical evaluation that included clinical examination , panendoscopy , complete blood count and biochemical profile , clearance creatinine , cardiovascular examination , chest x - ray or ct , and ct and/or mri of head and neck . patients with early stage resectable disease ( stage i - ii ) and selected patients of stage iii ( t2n1m0 ) were treated surgically . patients with locally advanced disease ( unresectable or marginally resectable ) , stage iii - iva , were treated either with induction chemotherapy or radical chemoradiation . depending on response after induction chemotherapy , patients underwent either surgery followed by postoperative chemoradiation or radical combined radiation therapy with chemotherapy . before induction chemotherapy the palpable edges of the primary lesion ( both the longest and the shortest axes ) were marked by at least four points , which were 0.5  cm away . tumor response was evaluated after the end of induction chemotherapy using a clinical examination and ct or mri of the head and neck with tumor volumetry . complete response ( cr ) was defined as a reduction of the tumor volume  70% up to the complete disappearance . partial response ( pr ) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of tumor , taking as reference the baseline sum diameters . progressive disease ( pd ) was defined as enlargement of tumor volume  20% or new tumor manifestations . stable disease ( sd ) was defined as insufficient shrinkage to qualify for pr and insufficient increase to qualify for pd . the median follow - up interval was 18 months ( range 4 to 36 months ) . patients are monitored every two months in the first two years , every three to four months in the next 3 to 5 years , and once a year thereafter until death . disease - free survival was estimated from the end of treatment to tumor recurrence , distant metastasis , or death from any cause . chi - squared tests were performed to assess statistical significance of any differences in prevalence . 2  2 contingency tables fisher 's exact test was performed along with odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals calculation . we collected 64 samples from the oral cavity , 19 of which were unsatisfactory for molecular analysis due to insufficient quantity of dna , thus 45 samples were finally analysed ( table 1 ) . the patients ' ages ranged from 19 to 82 years ( mean age : 51.9 years ) . clinical , pathological , and treatment characteristics of the patients are described in table 1 . papillocheck assay detected high risk hpv dna in 3/45 of the osccs ( 2 sccs of the oral tongue and 1 of the floor of the mouth ) . the different hpv types revealed by the dna and rna test are shown in table 2 . in the 3 high - risk hpv dna positive oral cavity cancers , hpv 16 was detected in 2 samples ( 1 case of scc of the oral tongue and 1 of the floor of the mouth ) and hpv 18 in 1 sample ( 1 case of oral tongue scc ) . in addition , the low - risk hpv 6 was found in 2 oral tongue samples . further analysis using the nuclisens easyq assay detected e6/e7 mrna expression from the five high - risk hpv types ( 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , and 45 ) in 4/45 of the total samples ( 8.9% ) ( 3 cases of oral tongue scc and 1 of the floor of the mouth ) . hpv 16 was the commonest type revealed by the rna test as shown in table 2 . as far as the site - specific oscc is concerned , hpv 16 was detected in 3 out of 5 hpv dna positive oral cavity sccs ( 2 cases of oral tongue scc and 1 of floor of the mouth ) , while hpv 18 was found in 1 out of 5 hpv - infected oral cavity sccs ( 1 case of oral tongue scc ) , by the rna detection method . 8 of 45 patients ( 1 stage i ( t1n0m0 ) , 5 stage ii ( t2n0m0 ) , 2 stage iii ( t2n1m0 ) ) underwent surgical excision ( 7 oral tongue , 1 maxilla ) . 4 of them had no adverse features , and they did not undergo any further treatment . the rest of the 4 patients with adverse features ( > 2 positive ln , resection margins < 5  mm , perineural tumor invasion , and vascular space invasion ) received external beam radiation therapy ( ebrt ) 5460  gy . all patients who were treated surgically are so far disease - free ( 7 hpv dna negative and 1 hpv dna positive ( defined as absence of recurrence at the primary site , assessed by physical examination at every clinic visit and imaging studies at specified intervals ) . however , one of them developed a second primary tumor of the lung and so far is disease - free from both primaries ( table 2 ) . from the 37 patients with locally advanced ( unresectable or marginally resectable ) disease ( stage iii - iva ) , 28 patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 2 cycles of tpf ( docetaxel 75  mg / m , ( d1 ) cisplatin 75  mg / m ( d1 ) , and 5-fu 500  mg / m ( d1-d5 ) ( referred as treatment protocol a ) and 9 patients underwent radical external beam radiation therapy ( ebrt : 6872  gy ) with concurrent chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) ( d1d22 ) and weekly cetuximab due to medical contraindications for induction chemotherapy with tpf ( referred as treatment protocol b ) .   from 28 patients treated with protocol a , 18 had complete response . 10 of them underwent radical surgery and 8 of them underwent radical radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy . depending on histological findings , patients underwent ebrt 5460  gy with or without concurrent chemotherapy ( cisplatin 75  mg / m d1 , d22 ) and weekly cetuximab . for the patients with high - risk features , such as r1 resection , extra capsular nodal spread , and vascular space invasion , perineural invasion total dose of 66 gy was granted . from 18 patients with complete response , 14 patients are today free of disease ( 3 hpv dna positive ( hpv 18 , 16 , 6 ) , 11 hpv dna negative ) , 2 died from lung metastasis ( 1 hpv dna positive ( hpv 16 ) , 1 hpv dna negative ) , and 2 are still alive with local recurrence ( 2 hpv dna negative ) ( table 2 ) . the rest of the 10 patients who were treated with protocol a had partial response ( table 1 ) . all of them underwent radical ebrt ( 6872  gy ) with concurrent chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) ( d1d22 ) and weekly cetuximab . 1 of them is free of disease , 6 died from metastatic disease , 1 died from other causes , and 2 of them are still alive with local recurrence . from 9 patients with stage iii - iva who were treated with protocol b , 5 of them are free of disease , 1 died from metastatic disease , and 3 are still alive with local recurrence . of the approximately 120  hpv types so far known to infect the mucosal surfaces of the genital tract , 14 are considered to be  high risk  or  oncogenic [ 1 , 2 ] . some of these high - risk types have been found in the oral cavity and oropharynx of both cancer - free adult individuals and in patients suffering from hnscc [ 4 , 7 , 8 , 12 ] . hpv 16 , the hpv type most prevalent in cervical sccs , is also the most common type present in hpv - positive hnsccs [ 10 , 1315 ] . the great variation in hpv prevalence found in osccs in different studies may be due to differences among the analyzed population , but also due to differences in the samples tested ( i.e. , formalin - fixed or fresh biopsies , exfoliated fresh cells ) , the methods of dna extraction , and , most importantly , the hpv detection methods used [ 8 , 16 ] . several studies using a variety of techniques , including immunohistochemistry , in situ hybridization , dot blot and southern blot hybridization , and polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , have been used to demonstrate the presence of hpv genome in hnscc [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 15 ] . our study shows that the use of dna and rna detection methods confirms the prevalence of hpv infection among patients with osccs . hpv 16 infection has been found in 2 cases . in both cases infected by hpv 16 , what is interesting is that the rna test revealed hpv 16  e6/e7  mrna . this may be explained by the fact that total viral dna of hpv 16 has been integrated into the host genome , and , therefore , it can not be detected by the dna test . in 75% of the hpv - positive sccs of the oral tongue , hpv implication in oral tongue cancer has already been stated by many authors [ 5 , 17 ] . on the other hand , clinical results indicated that the association between patient mortality and hpv detection was not statistically significant ( p = 0.4215 ) . the prevalence of hpv among currently disease - free patients was also not statically significant ( p = 1.000 ) . as already stated , e6/e7 mrna expression from high - risk hpv types is probably a less common event in hnscc patients [ 13 , 14 ] . nevertheless different investigators ' results suggest that hpv - positive carcinomas represent a different tumor entity [ 14 , 18 ] . high - risk hpv types demonstrate an integration tendency , as can be assumed in our study by the mrna oncoproteins ' expression . we should also mention , as many investigators indicate , that low - risk hpv types ( hpv 6 in our case ) have been found in some head and neck carcinomas and might be implicated in the carcinogenesis process [ 14 , 18 , 19 ] . although authors support better prognosis for hpv - positive oral cancer cases [ 3 , 14 , 16 , 18 ] , hpv - positive tumors are usually diagnosed in higher stage than hpv - negative tumors . therefore there is a small subgroup of hpv oral cancers that demonstrate a worse response to treatment and have a lower rate of survival . sexual transmission of oncogenic hpv genotypes is universally accepted for the anogenital region , whereas the route of infection for the oropharyngeal region is unclear [ 2 , 18 ] . although several studies have recently identified hpv , particularly type 16 , in a subset of squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsils and base of the tongue [ 9 , 14 , 16 , 21 ] , the possibility of sexual or other transmission of hpv in oral cancer patients also needs to be explored [ 5 , 6 , 18 ] . the immune response might also affect the survival , but it seems to depend on whether hpv is present in the tumor cells in an episomal form or as an integrated virus [ 14 , 18 ] . although our data showed a relatively low hpv and oral cancer association , people from different geographical regions often demonstrate higher or lower hpv prevalence in oscc , which could also be the reason for our results . despite the heterogeneity between different studies , hpv appears to play an important role in some types of oropharyngeal carcinomas and possibly a small subgroup of cancers in the oral cavity   and may represent an alternative pathway in carcinogenesis to the known and established factors of tobacco and alcohol [ 9 , 18 ] the ability to control head and neck cancer will therefore depend on three basic cornerstones : prevention , detection , and early diagnosis . the recent development of an hpv vaccine might offer hope for the prevention of cervical and anogenital carcinomas and possibly also represent an additional prevention option for a substantial number of patients with hnscc . this study described the detection rates and attribution of hpv genotypes as well as the e6/e7 mrna expression of site - specific osccs in 45 greek patients . dna and rna assays detected the same genotypes in all high - risk hpv infected samples . this study confirms the prevalence of hpv infection among patients with osccs . future analysis and followup of more osccs","the relation between hpv and head and neck cancer has recently and extensively been investigated . 
 the purpose of this study was to indentify hpv genotypes , as well as e6/e7 mrna expression of high - risk hpvs ( 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 and 45 ) in oral squamous cell carcinomas ( osccs ) from 45 greek patients . 
 the overall prevalence of hpv dna positive osccs was 11.1% ( 5/45 ) , while high - risk hpv dna was found in 6.7% ( 3/45 ) of osccs . 
 e6/e7 mrna expression was detected in 8.9% ( 4/45 ) of the oral cavity samples . 
 our data indicated that hpv 16 was the commonest genotype identified in hpv - positive osccs by both dna and rna tests . 
 this study confirms the prevalence of hpv infections among patients with osccs . 
 future analysis and followup of more osccs will enable us to correlate hpv detection and clinical outcome .",232
"in the past two decades , there has been tremendous growth of intensive care medicine in india . however , there are scant data on the organizational aspects , case mix and practice patterns in indian intensive care units ( icus ) . most of the available information comes from either single - center studies or studies in specific groups of patients or conditions . it is essential to have data from several indian icus to reflect the vast and diverse spectrum of critical care illness , services , and practices . such information may be useful to identify deficiencies in the organization of care and to identify targets for education , clinical improvement , and research . the data would provide baseline estimates of disease prevalence , severity of illness and mortality , essential for designing research studies . this multicenter study was planned to gather such information about icus all over india . in order to enable participation from a large number of icus throughout the country , we used a point prevalence design , obtaining data on four different days over a 1-year period . this was a multicenter , observational , point prevalence study , performed on four separate days . all patients present in the icu on july 14 , 2010 , october 13 , 2010 , january 12 , 2011 and april 13 , 2011 were included in the study . these days were the second wednesdays in the 1 month of each quarter and were representative of the major seasons . data were recorded for all patients present in the icu during the 24 h starting 08.00 am on the study day to 08.00 am next day . the first time an icu joined the study , data about the icu was recorded . a closed icu was defined as one in which final orders for the patient were written by the icu team ; an open icu was defined as one in which care of the patient was directed by non - icu doctor teams , and orders could be written by non - icu team doctors . a center was considered adequately equipped if all the following facilities were available either in the icu or in the hospital : renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) , computerized tomography scan , microbiology , biochemistry and hematology laboratories , echocardiography and cardiac catheterization laboratory . facilities available in the intensive care unit and hospital in 120 centres intensive care unit characteristics data collected for each patient included the following : 
 primary reasons for icu admission , source of admission , demographics , patient characteristics and comorbidities as listed in tables 3 and 4 . admission was defined as surgical if the patient was admitted to the icu from the operation theatre or recovery room . elective surgery was defined as a surgical procedure which was planned more than 24 h prior to icu admission . emergency surgery was defined as a surgical procedure before icu admission which was planned < 24 h in advance . the primary reason for icu admission was the single most applicable diagnostic category based on the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ( apache ) iii classificationage , physiological parameters , and comorbidities used to calculate the apache ii score and sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) score . physiological variables were the worst recorded values during the 24-h study period . when data for any parameter required calculation of the apache ii and sofa score was missing , that parameter was assumed to be normal . a sofa score of 3 or 4 for any individual organ was used to identify organ failureinterventions are listed in table 5presence of infection ( suspected or proven infection at icu admission or during the 24-h study period ) ; severe sepsis or septic shock ( svspss ) at any time during the patient 's icu stay ; suspected or proven tropical infections ( malaria , dengue , leptospirosis , scrub typhus ) ; microrganisms , and antibiotic therapy . primary reasons for icu admission , source of admission , demographics , patient characteristics and comorbidities as listed in tables 3 and 4 . admission was defined as surgical if the patient was admitted to the icu from the operation theatre or recovery room . elective surgery was defined as a surgical procedure which was planned more than 24 h prior to icu admission . emergency surgery was defined as a surgical procedure before icu admission which was planned < 24 h in advance . the primary reason for icu admission was the single most applicable diagnostic category based on the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ( apache ) iii classification age , physiological parameters , and comorbidities used to calculate the apache ii score and sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) score . when data for any parameter required calculation of the apache ii and sofa score was missing , that parameter was assumed to be normal . a sofa score of 3 or 4 for any individual organ was used to identify organ failure interventions are listed in table 5 presence of infection ( suspected or proven infection at icu admission or during the 24-h study period ) ; severe sepsis or septic shock ( svspss ) at any time during the patient 's icu stay ; suspected or proven tropical infections ( malaria , dengue , leptospirosis , scrub typhus ) ; microrganisms , and antibiotic therapy . primary reason for intensive care unit admission patient demographics , intensive care units admission characteristics and severity of illness * survival status at icu discharge was recorded within 30 days from the day of the study . patients discharged alive from icu were followed up till hospital discharge , or 30 days from the day of the study , whichever was earlier . for patients dying in the icu , investigators were asked to record whether any form of limitation of treatment occurred . terminal discharges ( tds ) from icu to a location outside the hospital , either on family or patient request , as well as those documented as left against medical advice , were also recorded . nonsurvivors were patients who died in the icu as well as those who were tds within 30 days from the day of the study . secondary outcomes were as follows : hospital mortality , defined as a composite of those who died in the hospital and tds from the icu within 30 days from the day of the study , and icu and hospital lengths of stay , till 30 days from the study day . the standardized mortality ratio ( smr ) using the hospital mortality and that predicted by apache ii was calculated for those patients who were admitted to the icu within 24 h of the study day . for calculation of icu and hospital length of stay , missing data analysis was confined to data from adult patients ( > 16 years of age ) . continuous variables were compared with the use of the student 's t - test , analysis of variance , mann - whitney test or the kruskal - wallis test . multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of icu mortality . a stepwise forward conditional multivariate analysis was performed with icu characteristics , patient factors , and interventions found to be statistically significant in the univariate analyses . analysis was confined to data from adult patients ( > 16 years of age ) . continuous variables were compared with the use of the student 's t -

test , analysis of variance , mann - whitney test or the kruskal - wallis test . multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of icu mortality . a stepwise forward conditional multivariate analysis was performed with icu characteristics , patient factors , and interventions found to be statistically significant in the univariate analyses . data analysis was done for adult patients ( n = 4038 ) from 120 icus . details of participation are provided in the supplementary tables 14 . about 81 centers ( 67.5% ) were considered adequately equipped , whereas 29 ( 32.5% ) were categorized as  not adequately equipped . patients in medical icus had significantly higher severity of illness and mortality compared to patients in other types of icus . more than half the number of participating icus had a patient - nurse ratio of two or less patients per nurse . the primary apache iii diagnostic categories are summarized in table 3 , and patient demographics , severity of illness , and outcomes are detailed in table 4 . almost 546 patients died in the icu , and 183 patients were tds from the icu . the hospital mortality was 21.7% and included 694 patients who died in hospital and 183 tds . median length of icu stay was 6 ( interquartile range [ iqr ] 3 - 13 ) days , with significantly longer stays in nonsurvivors than in icu survivors [ table 2 ] . figures 1 and 2 show the distribution of apache ii scores and number of organ failures with the associated mortality . almost 53.6% patients did not have any organ failure on the study day ; mortality was 8.3% in these patients . distribution of acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores ( number of patients in vertical bars on the y1 axis ) and mortality rate ( solid line on the y2 axis ) distribution of organ failures ( number of patients in vertical bars on the y1 axis ) and mortality rate ( solid line on the y2 axis ) a subset of 1718 patients were admitted within 24 h of a study day , of which 1627 patients could have an apache ii diagnostic category assigned to enable calculation of the predicted mortality . of these , 428 patients were predicted to die in hospital , whereas the observed hospital mortality was 286 . apache ii over predicted mortality at scores above 19 , as seen in figure 3 . observed mortality ( solid line ) versus acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii predicted mortality ( dashed line ) on the y2 axis in 1627 patients . horizontal bars denote number of patients ( y1 axis ) mortality was higher in inadequately equipped icus compared to well - equipped icus ( 27.8% vs. 20.8% , p < 0.001 ) , despite similar apache ii scores . medical admissions accounted for 77.1% of admissions ; they had a higher severity of illness than surgical admissions and a significantly higher mortality . similarly , mortality was significantly higher for admissions after emergency surgery than elective surgery [ table 3 ] . almost 124 patients were admitted after poisoning or drug overdose , including 72 organophosphorus or organochlorine poisoning , 5 snake bites and 21 unknown toxins . a sub - group of 1144 patients ( 28.3% ) had svspss during the icu stay , with mortality of 34.0% . about 12.2% patients developed an infection during their icu stay and 1455 patients had a suspected or confirmed infection during the 24-h study period . microbiological cultures and other tests for microbial identification were obtained in 2039 patients , and positive results were obtained in 35.9% . overall , 1077 organisms were identified : 68.9% gram - negative organisms , 15.9% gram - positive organisms , 7.5% fungi , 2.4% mycobacteria , 1.7% viruses , and 1.1% malarial parasites . various interventions in the icu are detailed in table 5 . on the study day , 5342 antibiotics were given to 72.4% patients , while 4.7% patients received antimalarials . about 60.7% of 2583 patients who did not have a suspected or confirmed infection on the study day received antibiotics , whereas 6.7% of the 1455 patients with a suspected or confirmed infection on the study day did not receive antibiotics . about 56.0% of medical patients and 72.3% of surgical patients received antibiotics without having a suspected or confirmed infection on that day . in patients receiving antimicrobials , patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation ( mv ) , vasopressors or inotropes ( vis ) , and rrt had significantly higher mortality than those who did not ( 35.6% vs. 11.1% , p < 0.001 ; 36.1% vs. 12.9% , p < 0.001 ; and 31.5% vs. 16.2% , p < 0.001 , respectively ) . in 898 patients receiving vis , arterial and central venous catheters were inserted in 46.7% and 71.4% patients , respectively , and cardiac output and lactate levels were measured in 10.9% and 18.8% patients , respectively . normal saline was the preferred fluid in more than 86% of the 1085 patients that received a fluid bolus . the results of the multivariate analysis of organizational and patient characteristics , severity of illness , and need for interventions are summarized in table 6 . the apache ii and sofa scores , public hospital icus , medical icus , inadequately equipped icus , medical admission , self - paying patient , the presence of svspss shock , acute respiratory failure ( pao2 /fio2 ratio < 300 ) or cancer , and the need for a fluid bolus and mv were independent predictors of mortality . patients had moderate severity of illness , as evidenced by an apache ii and sofa scores of 17.4  9.2 and 3.8  3.6 , respectively . this widespread practice of tds is contrary to that reported in one single center study and one study of end - of - life care practices in four hospitals in mumbai . it suggests that end - of - life care in indian icus may be suboptimal and is probably related to the unresolved legal status of withholding and withdrawal of life - sustaining treatments in critically ill patients in india . it may also perhaps reflect a small proportion of cases in which the patients or families wishes to have a peaceful death at home were respected . we assumed that all tds from the icu eventually died and included these in the icu mortality . admittedly , while a small proportion of tds may have survived , merely counting the number of patients who died in icu would underestimate the number of nonsurvivors . the low smr observed in a subset of patients in this study must be interpreted with caution . it may reflect the quality of care , but could also be due the visibly poor calibration of apache ii . variables such as the glasgow coma scale may have been inaccurately recorded in sedated patients , with resultant erroneously high apache ii scores . our mortality in patients with apache ii scores above 19 and in patients with 3 or more organ failures was lower than that predicted by apache ii or that observed by vincent et al . in their study of the sofa score . a formal evaluation of apache ii as well as other scoring systems is necessary to determine the scoring system that works best in our circumstances . our overall icu mortality rate of 18.1% was higher than the 16.2% rate observed in the intensive care over nations ( icon ) audit . our icu mortality of 34.0% from svspss was similar to the 36.7% mortality in a multicenter study of 150 icus from 16 asian countries . however , it was higher than that reported in the impress study ( 28.4% globally and 30.8% for asia ) and in the icon study ( 258% ) . in mechanically ventilated patients , mortality of 33.8% in our study was more than the 28% mortality reported in the third international survey on mv . thus , improvements are required in the organization and delivery of critical care in indian icus . it is essential to increase health insurance plans and government schemes to reduce the economic burden on individuals and families . absence of adequate facilities in the hospital may lead to inadequate or delayed care or may necessitate transport that may increase the risk of complications , with consequent increase in mortality . a study by parikh and karnad in a large public hospital icu in mumbai had an observed mortality of 36% , smr of 1.67 and lower intensity of interventions . this could represent either variations in case mix and clinical practice or could reflect inadequate facilities as well as patients inability to afford expensive interventions . perhaps , greater spending to attain higher levels of care in terms of equipment , drugs , interventions , staffing , and organization may lead to better outcomes with greater cost - effectiveness . a more detailed analysis that includes costs and the participation of more public hospital icus is essential to answer these questions . the presence of a training program in critical care medicine was not associated with improved outcome on multivariate analysis . a majority of the programs were of 1-year duration , and there have been variations in the intensity and quality of training between the accredited icus . the content and structure of the program , as well as the accreditation process , may need to be reviewed . we defined a closed icu as one where the final orders were written by the intensive care team . this includes the completely closed model , the semi - closed , transitional , or mandatory consult model or the high - intensity multidisciplinary care models . studies of the impact of high - intensity models on outcome have shown mixed results , with several studies showing improved mortality and better resource utilization , some showing no effect and one showing higher mortality . however , we were unable to demonstrate that closed units were associated with lower mortality , and this study was not designed to detect other benefits of a closed icu model . this study confirms that gram - negative infections are predominant in india ( 69% ) , as opposed to gram - positive infections in western countries . while antibiotics were given in 60.7% of noninfected patients , some patients may have been completing their course of antibiotics , and a proportion of noninfected surgical patients may have received antibiotics as perioperative prophylaxis . nevertheless , these data suggest that infection control practices and antibiotic stewardship need to be strengthened in indian icus . in patients receiving vis , insertion of arterial catheters , cardiac output monitoring and estimation of lactate levels were infrequently performed , perhaps because monitoring was not either available or was not utilized . arguably better - performing icus that were motivated and willing to share data contributed to the study , while icus with poor performance did not . only 11% of icus and 10% patients were from the public sector , but this may represent the general distribution of icus between the private and public sectors in india . source data verification was not performed . we assumed that the investigators correctly applied the definitions and diagnostic criteria for sepsis and other conditions such as malaria , dengue fever , etc . , some data were incomplete , especially for the length of icu stay and hospital stay . however , there was no systematic exclusion of data , and the information obtained would still remain valuable . we were unable to obtain data on physician staffing patterns , protocols and night - time coverage by intensivists . the strengths of this study include a large number of icus and patients from all regions of the country and from different types of icus . data from this study can be used to determine the prevalence of different conditions in indian icus , as well as to determine the baseline mortality rates in important subgroups of patients , e.g. , 34.0% in patients with svspss , 33.8% and 36.1% in patients requiring mv and vis , respectively . we did not estimate the smr from the apache ii score for all patients as we calculated the score on the study day , and not in the first 24 h of icu admission . however , we did estimate the smr for those patients whose apache scores were calculated within 24 h of icu admission . we only analyzed data from adult patients as there were only 171 children in the database . this multicenter , point - prevalence study of 4038 adult patients from 120 icus is a snapshot of intensive care in india . highlights include a moderate severity of illness with relatively high mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock , patients on vasopressors or inotropes or receiving mechanical ventilation . antibiotics are often given in noninfected patients , monitoring practices in seriously ill patients can be improved . self - paying patients , public hospitals icus , and inadequately equipped icus are independently associated with a worse outcome . terminal discharge from the icu is widely practiced and legal , social , and other issues related to end - of - life care need to be resolved .","aims : to obtain information on organizational aspects , case mix and practices in indian intensive care units ( icus).patients and methods : an observational , 4-day point prevalence study was performed between 2010 and 2011 in 4209 patients from 124 icus . 
 icu and patient characteristics , and interventions were recorded for 24 h of the study day , and outcomes till 30 days after the study day . 
 data were analyzed for 4038 adult patients from 120 icus.results:on the study day , mean age , acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ( apache ii ) and sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) scores were 54.1  17.1 years , 17.4  9.2 and 3.8  3.6 , respectively . 
 about 46.4% patients had 1 organ failure . 
 nearly , 37% and 22.2% patients received mechanical ventilation ( mv ) and vasopressors or inotropes , respectively . 
 nearly , 12.2% patients developed an infection in the icu . 
 about 28.3% patients had severe sepsis or septic shock ( svspss ) during their icu stay . 
 about 60.7% patients without infection received antibiotics . 
 there were 546 deaths and 183 terminal discharges ( tds ) from icu ( including left against medical advice or discharged on request ) , with icu mortality 729/4038 ( 18.1% ) . in 1627 
 patients admitted within 24 h of the study day , the standardized mortality ratio was 0.67 . 
 the apache ii and sofa scores , public hospital icus , medical icus , inadequately equipped icus , medical admission , self - paying patient , presence of svspss , acute respiratory failure or cancer , need for a fluid bolus , and mv were independent predictors of mortality.conclusions:the high proportion of tds and the association of public hospitals , self - paying patients , and inadequately equipped hospitals with mortality has important implications for critical care in india .",436
"deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) remains an underestimated problem in icu patients , despite the findings of many randomized controlled trials performed in the field of dvt prophylaxis after surgery during the past few decades . the canadian survey reported in the present issue of critical care   provides a useful snapshot of daily clinical practice in canada with regard to dvt prophylaxis . it strongly suggests that studies dedicated to dvt prophylaxis in icu patients should be performed in order to develop useful recommendations . furthermore , a great effort would have to be made to educate physicians regarding both dvt screening and pharmacological aspects . clinicians should be aware that dvt in icu patients has unusual characteristics that make its clinical diagnosis difficult . , in which the clinical signs of dvt ( e.g. oedema , pain and flushing ) occurred in less than 1.5% of patients . as a result , physicians are often lulled into an inappropriate sense of security . moreover , the diagnosis is not always easy to confirm . the insensitivity of doppler ultrasound and the major difficulty in performing venography in icu patients generally lead to blind anticoagulant prophylaxis . even when a pulmonary embolism leads to death , diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in a patient who has already been treated and ventilated for a pulmonary condition because autopsies are rarely conducted in trauma victims . as stated at the most recent american college of chest physicians consensus conference , however , trauma patients represent a group that is at very high risk for dvt . the discussion should therefore no longer focus on the incidence of thrombosis , but rather on the different methods of prevention that could be used . most of the canadian respondents in the survey appear to be aware of this , which would explain why up to 34% of icu directors do not consider mechanical prophylaxis at all . it has been strongly suggested , however , that elastic stockings should be combined with lmwh . combining noninvasive with pharmacological prophylaxis it is also cost - effective and easy to use . in order to improve the benefit from such combinations of mechanical and pharmacological measures , classic intermittent pneumatic compression devices applied directly to the entire leg are often difficult to use because of fractures , immobilization with plaster casts , or external fixation instruments . with the foot pump is designed to overcome the venous stasis that is associated with surgery . it flattens the metatarsal arch , emptying the venous plexus ( 30 ml blood ) and thus reproducing the effect of normal weight - bearing . the efficacy of the foot pump has already been demonstrated in level ii and iii studies . a recent large , prospective , randomized study conducted in 274 patients with total hip replacement   compared the safety and effectiveness of the foot pump with those of lmwh prophylaxis . that study showed no significant difference between the two methods ; dvt was detected in 24 ( 18% ) patients randomized to foot pump prophylaxis as compared with 18 patients ( 13% ) randomized to receive the lmwh enoxaparin . there was no difference in the transfusion requirements or intraoperative blood losses between the two groups . this new method could be helpful in trauma , neurological , or neurosurgical patients when anticoagulants are contraindicated . in summary , mechanical prophylaxis should systematically be used alone or in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis in icu patients . although unfractionated heparin ( 5000 iu administered subcutaneously two or three times per day ) is used extensively in the canadian centres , there is considerable evidence   that these small doses of heparin are relatively ineffective in comparison with doses used in orthopaedic surgery . in the literature , selection of unfractionated heparin was supported by dvt detection methods , such as echography and duplex scanning . these methods are unacceptable because of their low sensitivity in asymptomatic patients , especially in the icu . administration of lmwh has been shown to result in significantly better results . in 1996 , .   showed that 30 mg enoxaparin given twice daily exhibited superior antithrombotic efficacy as compared with subcutaneous heparin 5000 iu twice daily . the overall venographic dvt rate was reduced from 44 to 31% , and the proximal dvt rate from 15 to 6% in patients receiving heparin and enoxaparin , respectively . since then , only one relevant study has been reported , which compared lmwh with placebo in icu patients . in that study , nadroparin was able to decrease the dvt rate significantly , but no direct comparison between lmwh and unfractionated heparin was undertaken . although there is still insufficient data in the icu setting , the large amount of data gathered by surgical trials should allow extrapolation . lmwh appears to be effective and safe postoperatively , and hence should probably be recommended in icu patients except when renal function is impaired and in very old patients . the optimal duration of treatment has not been defined , but it appears reasonable to suggest that prophylaxis with lmwh should be continued for as long as risk factors are present , such as inflammation , sepsis and immobilization . new compounds such as recombinant hirudin   and pentasaccharide   should be evaluated in these very high risk patients because those agents have exhibited high efficacy in preventing dvt after total hip replacement surgery . they may be particularly useful in those settings in which thrombotic risk rapidly exceeds haemorrhagic risk . oral anticoagulants can not be recommended in trauma patients because some have to undergo multiple surgical procedures . in addition , interactions between vitamin k antagonists and other drugs used in this setting may be hazardous . thrombotic complications ( dvt , pulmonary emboli ) are a major concern in icu patients and still occur in a significant number of patients . antithrombotic agents , and lmwh in particular , should be considered in a systematic manner , except for those cases in which they are contraindicated . finally , educational programmes should be implemented that include epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of vte prevention . dvt = deep vein thrombosis ; icu = intensive care unit ; lmwh = low - molecular - weight heparin ; vte = venous thromboembolism .","the survey of how canadian intensive care units ( icus ) prevent and diagnose venous thromboembolism ( vte ) presented in this issue of critical care illustrates considerable variability . 
 lack of optimal patient care reflects how vte is rated in icus . 
 the discussion should no longer focus on the incidence of thrombosis , but rather on its prevention . 
 unfractionated heparin remains the most commonly used agent to prevent vte , despite the recognized efficacy and safety of low - molecular - weight heparins ( lmwhs ) in the icu setting . in addition , too few icu directors consider the use of mechanical prophylactic measures , such as graded elastic stockings and venous foot pump . 
 the present situation calls for large randomized controlled trials in either medical or surgical icu patients , and for new education programmes in order to modify the care of icu patients with regard to vte .",184

"transesophageal echocardiogram ( tee ) has been introduced to the operating room over 30 years ago . we report a case of esophageal perforation caused by tee during an aortic valve replacement operation , treated successfully with a new endoscopic clip . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of post - tee esophageal perforation treated endoscopically with this new clip device . a 72-year - old female was admitted to the operating theater for aortic valve replacement . during the operation and in the first hours in the intensive care unit ( icu ) the patient had to undergo tee in order to assess postoperative left ventricle performance status . a deep 2  1.5 cm ulcer covered with blood thrombus was found approximately 2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction . the rest of the endoscopy was unremarkable . within the next 48 h , thoracic and only a few blood clots were found in the area between the stomach and the left liver hilum , but no signs of mediastinitis or free intra - abdominal air . four days later , as the patient became febrile , a second gastroscopy was performed . a 2  1.5 cm perforation was seen at the same site of ulcer with no bleeding ( fig . due to the patient 's clinical condition and the size of the gap , an endoscopic intervention was decided . a new 12-mm clip ( otsc ; ovesco endoscopy , tbingen , germany ) was engaged . the clip is made of nitinol and approximates large perforation margins like a surgical clamp . the edges of the perforation were approximated by using a specific endoscopic double grasping forceps and applying suction through the cap . thus , the tissue was pulled into the cap and the clip was released by rotating the wheel attached to the shaft of the endoscope . a nasogastric levin tube was uneventfully left in the stomach under direct vision for long - term enteral feeding . further , the patient was offered two intra - abdominal drainage catheters in the operating theater so that intra - abdominal air and blood clots be drained and high fever get under control . all intra - abdominal and peripheral blood cultures were sterile . the patient was kept on intravenous antibiotics , proton pump inhibitors and parenteral nutrition over the next 10 days followed by enteral feeding through the levin tube . two weeks later she was transferred to the clinical ward , experiencing no dysphagia , and was discharged fully recovered 3 months after the operation . tee has safely been applied in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in icu departments for diagnostic purposes and monitoring over 30 years . factors that may determine the way of intervention following esophageal perforation are age , clinical condition , location and size of the perforation , cost of intervention and elapsed time since the injury . the time since perforation has occurred is crucial . a diagnosis delayed for more than 36 h is associated with high mortality ( 50% ) , despite surgical intervention . up to date , there have been no randomized controlled trials comparing surgical to endoscopic intervention regarding patient outcome . in our case , the tee performed in the operating theater and the icu led to esophageal perforation due to the patient 's esophagus anatomy . the delayed diagnosis of perforation is attributed to the blood thrombus on top of the ulcer seen in the first endoscopy that behaved as a sealant . our patient 's serious clinical condition precluded major surgical intervention , and it was decided to provide her with endoscopic therapy . additionally , due to the size of perforation and cost , a single clip that could seal the gap was very appealing . last , by leaving this clip in place for a long time , longer than common clips , could possibly guarantee safe sealing of this perforation . according to clip manufacturers , the clip may remain in place for over 6 months and is magnetic resonance imaging - safe . esophageal perforations closed endoscopically range from 3 to 25 mm in size . due to the new device technology ( twin grasper and the cap at the tip of endoscope ) , a single clip is enough and able to create a full - thickness closure of perforations up to 3 cm in diameter . this new clip provides a secure and successful esophageal perforation closure rate , up to 100% in perforations diagnosed within the first 24 h . according to this study , the clip remains in place for over 6 months and the mean repairing time of an esophageal perforation after successful multiple clipping is 18 days ( interquartile range 626 ) . most importantly , chronicity of perforation ( > 10 days ) was the only independent predictive factor for successful perforation closure in univariate and multivariate analysis . however , esophageal perforation as a complication of this clip during patient intubation has been reported in up to 3% of patients , but probably this can be attributed to the learning curve . indeed , in another study with 94 patients regarding the use of the otsc clip to narrow the pouch in patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery , no esophageal perforation occurred . in conclusion , although tee is a safe procedure , it may be complicated by esophageal perforation . we clearly showed and strongly suggest that esophageal perforation of 5 days can safely and successfully be treated endoscopically by applying this new otsc clip device .","esophageal perforation due to transesophageal echocardiogram ( tee ) during cardiac surgery is rare . 
 a 72-year - old female underwent tee during an operation for aortic valve replacement . 
 further , the patient presented hematemesis . 
 gastroscopy revealed an esophageal bleeding ulcer . 
 endoscopic therapy was successful . 
 although a ct scan excluded perforation , the patient became febrile , and a second gastroscopy revealed a big perforation at the site of ulcer . 
 the patient 's clinical condition required endoscopic intervention with a new otsc clip ( ovesco endoscopy , tbingen , germany ) . the perforation was successfully sealed . 
 the patient remained on intravenous antibiotics , proton pump inhibitors and parenteral nutrition for few days , followed by enteral feeding . 
 she was discharged fully recovered 3 months later . 
 we clearly demonstrate an effective , less invasive treatment of an esophageal perforation with a new endoscopic clip .",197
"adenomyoepithelioma has been described as a rare benign neoplasm that occurs almost exclusively in the breast . in the breast it is defined as a neoplasm composed of two structures , namely , tubules limited by an inner epithelial layer of duct - like cells and an outer layer with mostly clear myoepithelial cells . apart from the breast , adenomyoepitheliomas have been described in the salivary glands and in the lung . in the skin , these neoplasms seem to be exceedingly rare , with only few reports of adenomyoepitheliomas published to date [ 47 ] . we present the case of a 53-year - old woman with a clinically benign nodular cutaneous lesion that revealed histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of adenomyoepithelioma . a 53-year - old woman presented to her dermatologist with a 3 cm asymptomatic nodule on the left forearm . the biopsy specimen consisted of a 2.5  1.9  1.5 cm tan ellipse of skin and contained a hard yellow nodule measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension . examination of the sections at scanning magnification revealed beneath an intact epidermis a zone of fibrosis within the upper part of the dermis ( figure 1 a , b ) . beneath the scar , there was a large , lobulated neoplasm , which for the most part was surrounded by a compressed fibrous pseudocapsule . each of the aggregates of neoplastic cells varied in sizes and shapes and some were large and nodular ( figure 1a  c ) . at higher magnification , most of the cells that constituted the lesion displayed myoepithelial differentiation with polygonal and  plasmacytoid  features ( figure 2 ) . the cells presented sometimes as solid sheets , but also as cords and solitary units . in places glandular and ductal structures were evident ; in some areas apocrine - type secretion within glandular structures was found ( figure 2 a  c ) . f ) . in some areas cells were present within a myxoid stroma ( figure 2 g foci of cells with pleomorphic nuclei and mitotic figures were identified ( figure 2 k the myoepithelial cellular component of the neoplasm stained for s100 protein and was negative for cytokeratin and carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) expression . we describe a cutaneous neoplasm composed of myoepithelial cells and a focal epithelial and glandular component . the s100 positivity indicates myoepithelial cells , while epithelial - glandular cells are negative for s100 protein expression . based on findings by conventional microscopy and immunohistochemistry , this neoplasm shows myoepithelial differentiation and focal epithelial lined tubules with features of apocrine secretion , findings that are consistent with the diagnosis of primary adenomyoepithelioma of the skin . while various adnexal neoplasms with a myoepithelial cellular component have been described in the skin , adenomyoepithelioma of the skin seems to be extremely rare . what are the criteria that distinguish adenomyoepithelioma from other benign cutaneous neoplasms with myoepithelial differentiation ? while myoepithelioma is defined as a benign neoplasm consisting exclusively of myoepithelial cells embedded in a myxoid stroma , adenomyoepithelioma shows in addition to myoepithelial cells a second component displaying various degrees of epithelial - ductal differentiation . chondroid syringoma ,  at the other end of the spectrum is a benign adnexal neoplasm that , in addition to apocrine epithelium , manifests various degrees of follicular and/or sebaceous differentiation . clinically , myoepitheliomas occur usually in children and young adults and are located on the extremities , while mixed apocrine tumors affect older individuals and are usually found on the face . the few cases of cutaneous adenomyoepitheliomas that have been described to date , including the present case , were described in older patients and were located on the extremities and on the trunk . pleomorphic adenoma in the breast is regarded as the analogue to mixed apocrine tumor in the skin , while adenomyoepithelioma of the breast is defined as a neoplasm with nodular aggregations of clear myoepithelial cells that surround epithelial lined tubules . occasionally , the myoepithelial component predominates and loses the close association with epithelial structures . in the skin , the predominance of myoepithelial cells in relation to ductal epithelial structures lacking features of follicular and/or sebaceous differentiation separates this neoplasm from mixed apocrine tumor . therefore , myoepithelioma , adenomyoepithelioma and mixed apocrine tumor lie in the spectrum of neoplasms with pure myoepithelial differentiation at one end and apocrine - sebaceous - follicular differentiation at the other . the most important question for the patient is the biologic potential of such a lesion . while the chronic course in our patient and the majority of the histopathologic features suggest a benign neoplasm , foci of cells having pleomorphic nuclei and mitotic figures were present . both findings could indicate the potential for locally aggressive behavior and/or metastasis , as has been rarely described in adenomyoepitheliomas of the breast . therefore , adenomyoepitheliomas of the skin should be completely excised , as has been recommended in the reported case .","analogous to adenomyoepitheliomas of the breast , cutaneous adenomyoepithelioma is composed of two components , one being myoepithelial , the other ductal epithelial , and it lies in the spectrum of neoplasms having a  pure  myoepithelioma at one end and a mixed apocrine tumor at the other . 
 we present the case of a 53-year - old woman with a 3 cm nodular lesion on her left forearm that had been present for many years . 
 histopathologic examination revealed a large lobulated neoplasm surrounded by a compressed fibrous pseudocapsule . 
 most of the cells that constituted the lesion displayed myoepithelial differentiation arranged in solid sheets , cords , and solitary units . 
 glandular and ductal structures with features of apocrine differentiation composed the second part of the neoplasm . the myoepithelial cellular component of the neoplasm stained for s100 protein and was negative for cytokeratin and carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) . based on findings by conventional microscopy and immunohistochemistry , 
 the neoplasm was classified as primary adenomyoepithelioma of the skin .",251
"this report describes the design , implementation , and feasibility of the interstitial cystitis : elucidation of psychophysiologic and autonomic characteristics ( icepac ) study . interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome ( ic / bps ) causes severe bladder pain and afflicts about 2.5% of the population.1 the authors hypothesized abnormality of bladder perception at the central and/or peripheral nervous system levels . typical symptoms and findings support this hypothesis ( table 1 ) , and suggest ic / bps is better conceptualized as either a chronic pain disorder , one involving autonomic nervous system dysfunction , or a combination of both . classification as a chronic pain disorder may imply aberrant afferent ( sensory ) processing , whereas autonomic nervous system disorders are more often conceptualized as reflecting a primary efferent disturbance ( table 1 ) . if ic / bps reflects a nervous system disorder , the large number of comorbid diagnoses associated with ic / bps2 suggests a widespread abnormality , either in a large portion of peripheral nerves or in a single location of the central nervous system responsible for end - organ input , control , or both . a number of ic / bps comorbid psychiatric , chronic pain , and autonomic disorders have been described previously.3,4 examination of the interstitial cystitis database suggests significant overlap of ic / bps with other pain areas , including lower back , pelvic , and abdominal pain in 60%80% of subjects.5 the presence of headache , abdominal pain , tachycardia , panic attacks , dry eyes and mouth , heat intolerance , and cold - sensitive fingers and toes suggests increased sympathetic activity in ic / bps.3,6,7 studies investigating autonomic function in ic / bps identified the presence of abnormal vasomotor tone,810 increased bladder sympathetic neuron density,6,11 and increased urine norepinephrine excretion.12 stress response is partially explored in chronic pain disorders like ic / bps . prior provocative testing was restricted to physical stressors , though the stress response system behaves differently when activated by physical or psychosocial stressors.13 moreover , disease activity at testing is generally not reported , further complicating interpretation . in feline ic / bps , sympathetic outflow increases1416 while the hypothalamic  pituitary  adrenal axis does not respond to external threat.17 sympathetic nervous system outflow may become exaggerated since adrenocortical hormone activity normally restrains sympathetic nervous system outflow.3,18 adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations appear to decline during the stress of an ic / bps flare in women3 and in men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome.19 lutgendorf et al15 found that although mean urinary or salivary cortisol did not differ between women with ic / bps and controls , subjects with higher morning cortisol had significantly less pain and urgency and those with higher urinary free cortisol reported less overall symptomatology ( p<0.05 ) . thus , information to date suggests correlation between lower circulating cortisol concentration , higher sympathetic nervous system outflow , and higher pain levels . the study aims to define autonomic , psychological , and other ic / bps comorbid disorders , evaluate associated changes in autonomic and sensory nervous system structure and function , and characterize stress response physiology . this paper describes the study design and feasibility in a population that is difficult to research in adequate number.20 developed initially by a core group of investigators , the protocols utilized in icepac evolved in the first year of the study through the guidance of an advisory board with expertise in each of the fields encompassed in this complex interdisciplinary effort . the board meets annually to review study progress , advise the investigators , and serves as the data safety and monitoring board . icepac plans to enroll 228 women aged 1880 years : 76 ic / bps subjects , 76 mpp subjects , 38 family member subjects ( female siblings / parents / children of ic / bps patients ) , and 38 healthy controls . the mpp group was selected to determine if findings are specific to ic / bps or occur with other pelvic pain syndromes . ic / bps was defined by at least 6 months of urgency , frequency , and bladder pain clearly linked to bladder filling and emptying . mpp was defined by at least 3 months of chronic pelvic pain unrelated to bladder state and a minimum of two of five pelvic floor tender points scoring > 4/10 on a numeric rating scale ( nrs ) when examined applying 2 kg pressure with the index finger . the differing pain durations for subjects to be classified as ic / bps or mpp , though not optimally comparable , are required for two reasons : 1 ) these durations reflect the current definitions found in the literature , and 2 ) subjects with mpp often become diagnosed and treated , effectively reducing pain burden , before 6 months have elapsed leading to recruitment difficulties if mpp inclusion requires 6 months of recent pain . family members of ic / bps subjects are excluded if they have any history of ic / bps , mpp , or chronic pelvic pain as they would then be indistinguishable from subjects with pelvic pain . healthy controls must have no history , symptoms or signs of fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome , ic / bps , mpp , chronic pelvic pain , migraine headache , or any other putative ic / bps comorbid disorders and be age matched to within 3 years of an ic / bps subject . general exclusion criteria include : attempted , recent , or existing pregnancy , recurrent urinary tract infections in the last 12 months , pelvic or bladder neoplasm , major organ impairment , uncontrolled illness or unstable medical disorder , central or peripheral nervous system disorder associated with its own confounding autonomic and neurologic findings , drug / medical device or noninvasive treatment initiation ( eg , bladder instillation , pelvic floor therapy ) within 30 days , major surgical intervention ( eg , cystoplasty , sacral neuromodulation therapy ) within 120 days , use of hormones ( except insulin , thyroid replacement , or oral contraceptives ) , opioid medications or allergy to bupivacaine , inability to stop all autonomic and gastrointestinal motility modifying agents prior to testing , any condition impairing ability to consent and comply with study procedures , or math / speech / needle phobia . all subjects sign an informed consent prior to undergoing any study procedures in accordance with the institutional review board of university hospitals case medical center in cleveland , oh , usa . the study administration is handled by the principal investigator ( pi ) , co - pi , and project manager . five satellite locations are used to screen and refer patients . to further increase recruitment , subcontracts were developed with summa health systems ( akron , oh , usa ) and the university of toledo medical center ( toledo , oh , usa ) to allow recruitment from other hospital systems located in the region . with a diverse group of investigators performing the screening visit , it was necessary to standardize the examination to eliminate procedural bias . a total of four independent screening examinations were performed with each investigator ; the first two conducted by the icepac study pi while the trained investigator observed . after observing two examinations , this process took place on four different days and with four different patients to establish examiner consistency . additional rigor is brought to subject selection by requiring a structured screening examination , even if the referral came from a study investigator trained to perform the visit . a customized filemaker pro ( filemaker , inc . , santa clara , ca , usa ) , password protected database ( figure 1 ) resides on an encrypted network at the medical center . research assistants ( ra ) perform real - time entry of all registration , visit , and testing data that is internally validated and stored in the database . the icepac online survey system , developed specifically for this study , allows subjects to enter questionnaire responses into the database . the ra monitors responses in real time at a different terminal to validate subject response patterns , speed , and subject attention . data are stored in the icepac research database and the icepac online survey system is backed up daily . data stored within the two systems can be exported and analyzed using the desired analytic software package . completion is anticipated in early 2015 with enrollment through december 2012 depicted in figure 2 . subjects may contact icepac study staff or give permission for study staff to contact them and schedule a screening visit ( visit 0 ) . in the first year , a steady referral volume originated from a bimonthly interdisciplinary pelvic pain clinic , structured so that appropriate interested subjects could be consented , enrolled , and have their screening visit performed that day . mothers , sisters , and daughters accompanying study subjects to their visits are directly solicited . in addition to flyers at satellite clinics and postings in internal university / hospital communications , the study is listed on researchmatch.com and clinicaltrials.gov . investigators also guest lecture at regional ic support group meetings throughout northeast and central ohio . for example , initial inclusion criteria excluded mpp from the ic / bps group and excluded ic / bps from the mpp group to enable clean comparisons . the advisory board was concerned about recruitment and how realistic it might be to find patients with ic / bps who did not have mpp and recommended that the ic / bps group be allowed to have comorbid mpp , while keeping the mpp group clean ( without ic / bps ) . enrollment ( not completed subjects ) of the ic / bps group through december 2012 numbers 37 , of whom 25 also have mpp . had this change not been implemented , only twelve subjects would be enrolled while 25 would have been excluded . after informed consent , the initial standard medical evaluation includes a medical history , physical exam , pregnancy , and urine dipstick tests . physical evaluation includes height , weight , lying and standing blood pressure and heart rate , body temperature , and body mass index . an ra leads each visit to ensure direct , in - person contact between clinical and study personnel.21 once the above information is obtained , a study investigator reviews subject information and performs a routine physical examination of the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat , heart , lungs , extremities , and abdomen and assesses neurologic function . particular attention is paid to any neurologic findings ( eg , neuropathy , parkinsonian features ) that would require exclusion . . figures 3 and 4 show the locations of points examined for tenderness over the abdominal musculature , the inguinal ligaments , adductor muscles , and the pelvic floor musculature . the abdomen , inguinal region , and adductors are examined by applying 3 kg of force using an algometer ( model fdn-50 ; wagner instruments , greenwich , ct , usa ) . both the force associated with the first pain experience and a pain score ( nrs : 010 ) at 3 kg ( or the maximum tolerated force ) are recorded . pelvic floor muscle examination is done using 2 kg finger pressure where the study investigator standardizes the pressure applied by the digit with the algometer prior to starting the examination . the vulvodynia examination involves moving a lubricated cotton - tipped applicator back and forth inside the vagina ( reported as a pressure or pain sensation ) followed by a standard six - point assessment of the vulvar mucosa . the subject is oriented to the sensation of pin and cotton on the thigh and asked to determine whether similar contact on the vulva is experienced as pin or cotton and to rank any pain on an nrs of 010 . a diagnosis of vulvodynia requires three or more points ranked at a pain nrs of four or more . the fibromyalgia examination is conducted per american college of rheumatology criteria22 using 4 kg of pressure applied by the thumb standardized against the pressure algometer at standard sites . the fibromyalgia examination is conducted at visit 0 only for healthy controls  as fibromyalgia is exclusionary for healthy controls  and at visit 2 for ic / bps , mpp , and family members . the ra records the subject pain ratings and study investigator comments pertaining to the examination . based on history , examination , and referring physician records , subjects are grouped as ic / bps  mpp , mpp alone , or healthy subject . if the subject qualifies for the study , the ra schedules additional study visits and the subject is sent home with a urine hat and 24-hour voiding diary to be completed before her next visit . study ineligibility may lead to one of two actions : 1 ) the subject may qualify at a later date ( ie , if subject had a recent procedure that requires a specific delay before enrollment ) , and will be contacted to return at the appropriate time ; or 2 ) subject will be excluded from the study indefinitely . subjects arrive with their completed 24-hour voiding diary having not voided in the prior hour . subjects use a portable computer to complete the psychological and ohio dysautonomia ( odysa ) questionnaires40 on the icepac online survey system while the ra monitors progress and validates responses . the questionnaires listed in table 2 are administered in random order to neutralize any questionnaire order effect with the exception of the odysa , which is given last due to its length . the odysa questionnaire was developed over the last several years to query for the presence of symptoms suggestive of comorbid disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia , raynaud s syndrome , complex regional pain syndrome , migraine headache , irritable bowel syndrome , cyclic vomiting syndrome , functional dyspepsia , syncope , and orthostatic intolerance . subjects are informed that they are not required to answer all questions and may skip questions should they feel uncomfortable for any reason . the ra will verify missing questionnaire data with the subject to determine whether omission was intentional before proceeding forward with the study visit . visit 1 also includes a 20 ml bladder instillation of a 0.75% bupivacaine solution performed on ic / bps and mpp subjects only . the local anesthetic solution is prepared by the university hospitals research pharmacy ( university hospitals , cleveland , oh , usa ) and dropped off at the procedure location . since the intent of this procedure is to relate the change in bladder function to local anesthetic induced change in afferent processing , subjects undergo a baseline bladder ultrasound and uroflow ( flopoint elite ; verathon , bothell , wa , usa ) measurement so that pre- and post - procedure volumes can be matched as closely as possible for an  apples to apples prior to receiving the bladder instillation , the investigator cleans the subject s urethra with three benzalkonium chloride swabsticks ( aplicare , inc . , meriden , ct , usa ) , and then inserts a lubricated 8f pediatric catheter ( c.r . , murray hill , nj , usa ) . the subject is asked to hold the solution in the bladder for a minimum of 60 minutes if possible . subjects are asked to give pain ratings pre- and post - instillation . while waiting to void , subjects are given water to drink and the odysa questionnaire to complete . after 60 minutes of holding the solution , bladder volume is determined via ultrasound for comparison to the baseline volume reading . if the volume is reduced compared to baseline , more water is given and the bladder is subjected to ultrasound again after a suitable period of time has elapsed . once the volume is approximately equal to that of the baseline recording ( 10% ) , a final uroflow is performed . subjects who received an instillation are given a 3-day voiding diary to return at the final study visit and reminded which medications must be stopped prior to their next visit . at this visit , the investigator reviews medications the subject will need to temporarily discontinue / halt prior to the autonomic testing study visit ( visit 2 ) . autonomic testing includes the cardiac responses to deep breathing and to the valsalva maneuver , the post - ganglionic quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test , and a tilt table test . ras complete all autonomic nervous system testing with a trained investigator required only during the tilt table test . the methods of the autonomic nervous system laboratory have been previously described23 and will be reiterated here in brief . the cardiac response to deep breathing is a fairly pure measure of pulmonary afferent stretch receptor and cardiac parasympathetic efferent activities.24 the subject takes six full breaths per minute for 1 minute while an electrocardiogram records heart rate . the difference between inspiration ( higher heart rate ) and expiration ( lower heart rate ) is averaged for the five best breaths and compared to age - based norms . the valsalva maneuver is performed by asking the subject to blow against a pressure gauge holding 40 mmhg for 15 seconds with an open glottis ( insured by a small leak in the connecting tubing ) while continuous blood pressure , measured by digital plethysmography ( nexfin monitor model 1 ; bmeye b.v . , amsterdam , the netherlands ) , and heart rate are recorded . measurements include the highest heart rate at the end of the pressure holding period ( phase ii )  reflecting cardiac sympathetic function , the lowest heart rate after release ( phase iv )  reflecting cardiac parasympathetic function , and maintenance of diastolic pressure throughout phase ii  reflecting vasomotor sympathetic function . age - based norms are expressed as a ratio of the highest to lowest heart rates ( valsalva ratio ) . the tilt - table test requires the subject to remain inclined at 70 degrees for 30 minutes preceded and followed by baseline blood pressure and heart rate readings taken each minute for 510 minutes . the subject is asked every few minutes for any standard orthostatic symptoms such as lightheadedness , nausea , diaphoresis , blurred or darkening vision , and fatigue , ranked on a nrs from 010 . tilt results are interpreted as either normal , showing orthostatic hypotension ( > 20 mmhg systolic or > 10 mmhg diastolic blood pressure drop in the first 3 minutes of tilt ) , postural tachycardia syndrome ( > 30 beats per minute ( bpm ) rise in heart rate in the first 10 minutes of tilt in the presence of orthostatic symptoms and in the absence of a drop in blood pressure ) , or reflex syncope ( an abrupt drop in pressure usually accompanied by a drop in heart rate that would have led to loss of consciousness had the subject not been reclined ) . the heart rate record is also analyzed for heart rate variability . during the tilt test , the gastric electrical activity ( polygram net analysis package ; medtronic , minneapolis , mn , usa ) is recorded for 10 minutes with the patient in the supine position and then during the 30 minutes of head - up tilt . the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test provides a specific measure of cholinergic sympathetic efferent small fiber function . in brief , a battery sourced current is driven for 5 minutes across a 10% solution of acetylcholine located in the outer chamber of a dual - chambered capsule applied to the skin . sweat rate is detected through the change in humidity in the inner chamber of the same capsule . since each sudomotor nerve innervates multiple sweat glands , the axon stimulated by the acetylcholine iontophoresis signals the other sweat glands and results in sweat output into the inner chamber.25 the remainder of visit 2 is performed in a standard examination room . a water load test26 is administered , which consists of recording the maximal volume of water a subject can consume in 5 minutes with comparison to normal values . subjects classified as ic / bps , mpp , or family members then undergo a fibromyalgia examination based on the 1990 american college of rheumatology22 criteria , checking the 18 standard tender points applying 4 kg of pressure with the thumb , calibrated using an algometer every fourth point . an examination of the extremities ( small fiber score ) looking for generalized small ( and large ) fiber peripheral nerve dysfunction is performed assessing pin , temperature , vibration sensation , superficial and deep allodynia , distal muscle strength , and reflexes ( figure 5 ) . a pelvic neurologic examination27 is performed to evaluate dermatomes t12 , l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , and s5 for pin prick and vibration sensations . subjects are compensated for their time and offered participation in other icepac substudies such as the trier social stress test study28 or an icepac sleep study investigating sleep disorders in women with ic / bps . icepac plans to enroll 228 women aged 1880 years : 76 ic / bps subjects , 76 mpp subjects , 38 family member subjects ( female siblings / parents / children of ic / bps patients ) , and 38 healthy controls . the mpp group was selected to determine if findings are specific to ic / bps or occur with other pelvic pain syndromes . ic / bps was defined by at least 6 months of urgency , frequency , and bladder pain clearly linked to bladder filling and emptying . mpp was defined by at least 3 months of chronic pelvic pain unrelated to bladder state and a minimum of two of five pelvic floor tender points scoring > 4/10 on a numeric rating scale ( nrs ) when examined applying 2 kg pressure with the index finger . the differing pain durations for subjects to be classified as ic / bps or mpp , though not optimally

impairment , uncontrolled illness or unstable medical disorder , central or peripheral nervous system disorder associated with its own confounding autonomic and neurologic findings , drug / medical

within 120 days , use of hormones ( except insulin , thyroid replacement , or oral contraceptives ) , opioid medications or allergy to bupivacaine , inability to stop all autonomic and gastrointestinal motility modifying agents prior to testing , any condition impairing ability to consent and comply with study procedures , or math / speech / needle phobia . all subjects sign an informed consent prior to undergoing any study procedures in accordance with the institutional review board of university hospitals case medical center in cleveland , oh , usa . the study administration is handled by the principal investigator ( pi ) , co - pi , and project manager . five satellite locations are used to screen and refer patients . to further increase recruitment , subcontracts were developed with summa health systems ( akron , oh , usa ) and the university of toledo medical center ( toledo , oh , usa ) to allow recruitment from other hospital systems located in the region . with a diverse group of investigators performing the screening visit , it was necessary to standardize the examination to eliminate procedural bias . a total of four independent screening examinations were performed with each investigator ; the first two conducted by the icepac study pi while the trained investigator observed . after observing this process took place on four different days and with four different patients to establish examiner consistency . additional rigor is brought to subject selection by requiring a structured screening examination , even if the referral came from a study investigator trained to perform the visit . ca , usa ) , password protected database ( figure 1 ) resides on an encrypted network at the medical center . research assistants ( ra ) perform real - time entry of all registration , visit , and testing data that is internally validated and stored in the database . the icepac online survey system , developed specifically for this study , allows subjects to enter questionnaire responses into the database . the ra monitors responses in real time at a different terminal to validate subject response patterns , speed , and subject attention . data are stored in the icepac research database and the icepac online survey system is backed up daily . data stored within the two systems can be exported and analyzed using the desired analytic software package . completion is anticipated in early 2015 with enrollment through december 2012 depicted in figure 2 . subjects may contact icepac study staff or give permission for study staff to contact them and schedule a screening visit ( visit 0 ) . in the first year , a steady referral volume originated from a bimonthly interdisciplinary pelvic pain clinic , structured so that appropriate interested subjects could be consented , enrolled , and have their screening visit performed that day . mothers , sisters , and daughters accompanying study subjects to their visits are directly solicited . in addition to flyers at satellite clinics and postings in internal university / hospital communications , the study is listed on researchmatch.com and clinicaltrials.gov . investigators also guest lecture at regional ic support group meetings throughout northeast and central ohio . for example , initial inclusion criteria excluded mpp from the ic / bps group and excluded ic / bps from the mpp group to enable clean comparisons . the advisory board was concerned about recruitment and how realistic it might be to find patients with ic / bps who did not have mpp and recommended that the ic / bps group be allowed to have comorbid mpp , while keeping the mpp group clean ( without ic / bps ) . enrollment ( not completed subjects ) of the ic / bps group through december 2012 numbers 37 , of whom 25 also have mpp . had this change not been implemented , only twelve subjects would be enrolled while 25 would have been excluded . after informed consent , the initial standard medical evaluation includes a medical history , physical exam , pregnancy , and urine dipstick tests . physical evaluation includes height , weight , lying and standing blood pressure and heart rate , body temperature , and body mass index . an ra leads each visit to ensure direct , in - person contact between clinical and study personnel.21 once the above information is obtained , a study investigator reviews subject information and performs a routine physical examination of the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat , heart , lungs , extremities , and abdomen and assesses neurologic function . particular attention is paid to any neurologic findings ( eg , neuropathy , parkinsonian features ) that would require exclusion . . figures 3 and 4 show the locations of points examined for tenderness over the abdominal musculature , the inguinal ligaments , adductor muscles , and the pelvic floor musculature . the abdomen , inguinal region , and adductors are examined by applying 3 kg of force using an algometer ( model fdn-50 ; wagner instruments , greenwich , ct , usa ) . both the force associated with the first pain experience and a pain score ( nrs : 010 ) at 3 kg ( or the maximum tolerated force ) are recorded . pelvic floor muscle examination is done using 2 kg finger pressure where the study investigator standardizes the pressure applied by the digit with the algometer prior to starting the examination . the vulvodynia examination involves moving a lubricated cotton - tipped applicator back and forth inside the vagina ( reported as a pressure or pain sensation ) followed by a standard six - point assessment of the vulvar mucosa . the subject is oriented to the sensation of pin and cotton on the thigh and asked to determine whether similar contact on the vulva is experienced as pin or cotton and to rank any pain on an nrs of 010 . a diagnosis of vulvodynia requires three or more points ranked at a pain nrs of four or more . the fibromyalgia examination is conducted per american college of rheumatology criteria22 using 4 kg of pressure applied by the thumb standardized against the pressure algometer at standard sites . the fibromyalgia examination is conducted at visit 0 only for healthy controls  as fibromyalgia is exclusionary for healthy controls  and at visit 2 for ic / bps , mpp , and family members . the ra records the subject pain ratings and study investigator comments pertaining to the examination . based on history , examination , and referring physician records , subjects are grouped as ic / bps  mpp , mpp alone , or healthy subject . if the subject qualifies for the study , the ra schedules additional study visits and the subject is sent home with a urine hat and 24-hour voiding diary to be completed before her next visit . study ineligibility may lead to one of two actions : 1 ) the subject may qualify at a later date ( ie , if subject had a recent procedure that requires a specific delay before enrollment ) , and will be contacted to return at the appropriate time ; or 2 ) subject will be excluded from the study indefinitely . subjects arrive with their completed 24-hour voiding diary having not voided in the prior hour . subjects use a portable computer to complete the psychological and ohio dysautonomia ( odysa ) questionnaires40 on the icepac online survey system while the ra monitors progress and validates responses . the questionnaires listed in table 2 are administered in random order to neutralize any questionnaire order effect with the exception of the odysa , which is given last due to its length . the odysa questionnaire was developed over the last several years to query for the presence of symptoms suggestive of comorbid disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia , raynaud s syndrome , complex regional pain syndrome , migraine headache , irritable bowel syndrome , cyclic vomiting syndrome , functional dyspepsia , syncope , and orthostatic intolerance . subjects are informed that they are not required to answer all questions and may skip questions should they feel uncomfortable for any reason . the ra will verify missing questionnaire data with the subject to determine whether omission was intentional before proceeding forward with the study visit . visit 1 also includes a 20 ml bladder instillation of a 0.75% bupivacaine solution performed on ic / bps and mpp subjects only . the local anesthetic solution is prepared by the university hospitals research pharmacy ( university hospitals , cleveland , oh , usa ) and dropped off at the procedure location . since the intent of this procedure is to relate the change in bladder function to local anesthetic induced change in afferent processing , subjects undergo a baseline bladder ultrasound and uroflow ( flopoint elite ; verathon , bothell , wa , usa ) measurement so that pre- and post - procedure volumes can be matched as closely as possible for an  apples to apples  comparison of detrusor and sphincter functions . prior to receiving the bladder instillation , the investigator cleans the subject s urethra with three benzalkonium chloride swabsticks ( aplicare , inc . , meriden , ct , usa ) , and then inserts a lubricated 8f pediatric catheter ( c.r . the subject is asked to hold the solution in the bladder for a minimum of 60 minutes if possible . subjects are asked to give pain ratings pre- and post - instillation . while waiting to void , subjects are given water to drink and the odysa questionnaire to complete . after 60 minutes of holding the solution , bladder volume is determined via ultrasound for comparison to the baseline volume reading . if the volume is reduced compared to baseline , more water is given and the bladder is subjected to ultrasound again after a suitable period of time has elapsed . once the volume is approximately equal to that of the baseline recording ( 10% ) , a final uroflow is performed . subjects who received an instillation are given a 3-day voiding diary to return at the final study visit and reminded which medications must be stopped prior to their next visit . at this visit , the investigator reviews medications the subject will need to temporarily discontinue / halt prior to the autonomic testing study visit ( visit 2 ) . autonomic testing includes the cardiac responses to deep breathing and to the valsalva maneuver , the post - ganglionic quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test , and a tilt table test . ras complete all autonomic nervous system testing with a trained investigator required only during the tilt table test . the methods of the autonomic nervous system laboratory have been previously described23 and will be reiterated here in brief . the cardiac response to deep breathing is a fairly pure measure of pulmonary afferent stretch receptor and cardiac parasympathetic efferent activities.24 the subject takes six full breaths per minute for 1 minute while an electrocardiogram records heart rate . the difference between inspiration ( higher heart rate ) and expiration ( lower heart rate ) is averaged for the five best breaths and compared to age - based norms . the valsalva maneuver is performed by asking the subject to blow against a pressure gauge holding 40 mmhg for 15 seconds with an open glottis ( insured by a small leak in the connecting tubing ) while continuous blood pressure , measured by digital plethysmography ( nexfin monitor model 1 ; bmeye b.v . measurements include the highest heart rate at the end of the pressure holding period ( phase ii )  reflecting cardiac sympathetic function , the lowest heart rate after release ( phase iv )  reflecting cardiac parasympathetic function , and maintenance of diastolic pressure throughout phase ii  reflecting vasomotor sympathetic function . age - based norms are expressed as a ratio of the highest to lowest heart rates ( valsalva ratio ) . the tilt - table test requires the subject to remain inclined at 70 degrees for 30 minutes preceded and followed by baseline blood pressure and heart rate readings taken each minute for 510 minutes . the subject is asked every few minutes for any standard orthostatic symptoms such as lightheadedness , nausea , diaphoresis , blurred or darkening vision , and fatigue , ranked on a nrs from 010 . tilt results are interpreted as either normal , showing orthostatic hypotension ( > 20 mmhg systolic or > 10 mmhg diastolic blood pressure drop in the first 3 minutes of tilt ) , postural tachycardia syndrome ( > 30 beats per minute ( bpm ) rise in heart rate in the first 10 minutes of tilt in the presence of orthostatic symptoms and in the absence of a drop in blood pressure ) , or reflex syncope ( an abrupt drop in pressure usually accompanied by a drop in heart rate that would have led to loss of consciousness had the subject not been reclined ) . the heart rate record is also analyzed for heart rate variability . during the tilt test , the gastric electrical activity ( polygram net analysis package ; medtronic , minneapolis , mn , usa ) is recorded for 10 minutes with the patient in the supine position and then during the 30 minutes of head - up tilt . the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test provides a specific measure of cholinergic sympathetic efferent small fiber function . in brief , a battery sourced current is driven for 5 minutes across a 10% solution of acetylcholine located in the outer chamber of a dual - chambered capsule applied to the skin . sweat rate is detected through the change in humidity in the inner chamber of the same capsule . since each sudomotor nerve innervates multiple sweat glands , the axon stimulated by the acetylcholine iontophoresis signals the other sweat glands and results in sweat output into the inner chamber.25 the remainder of visit 2 is performed in a standard examination room . a water load test26 is administered , which consists of recording the maximal volume of water a subject can consume in 5 minutes with comparison to normal values . subjects classified as ic / bps , mpp , or family members then undergo a fibromyalgia examination based on the 1990 american college of rheumatology22 criteria , checking the 18 standard tender points applying 4 kg of pressure with the thumb , calibrated using an algometer every fourth point . an examination of the extremities ( small fiber score ) looking for generalized small ( and large ) fiber peripheral nerve dysfunction is performed assessing pin , temperature , vibration sensation , superficial and deep allodynia , distal muscle strength , and reflexes ( figure 5 ) . a pelvic neurologic examination27 is performed to evaluate dermatomes t12 , l1 , l2 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , and s5 for pin prick and vibration sensations . subjects are compensated for their time and offered participation in other icepac substudies such as the trier social stress test study28 or an icepac sleep study investigating sleep disorders in women with ic / bps . after informed consent , the initial standard medical evaluation includes a medical history , physical exam , pregnancy , and urine dipstick tests . physical

completed for 25 healthy controls , 33 ic / bps  mpp , eight mpp , and three family members . initially , the pi and co - pi were the main source of referrals , but this pattern was not sustainable once clinic populations were exhausted . efforts at maintaining contact with investigators to encourage referrals have led to gradual referral growth across a broader group of referrers . study investigators are kept up - to - date on study progress through an icepac investigator newsletter , which also serves as a reminder to refer . to date , the only adverse events have been associated with the bupivacaine instillation procedure . as a result , the investigators , guided by the icepac data safety monitoring board adopted a smaller , pediatric hydrophilic catheter and , since then , no further adverse events of any type have been reported . studies involving chronic pain disorders such as ic / bps pose two very specific challenges . first , in the current era , most successful clinical  translational studies on disorders involving chronic pain are interdisciplinary in design , requiring significant education , cross - training , and front - end work for the team to be successful . md , usa ) is currently funding much of the work on ic / bps through the multidisciplinary approach to the study of chronic pelvic pain ( mapp ) multisite network . second , these populations have been difficult to recruit in large numbers.20 the purpose here is to present an approach to both of these challenges for the benefit of others who are performing related studies and spell out which strategies were and were not successful . the original proposal arose from a collaboration funded by the interstitial cystitis association of america between dr buffington and dr chelimsky on the familial characteristics of ic / bps and an interdisciplinary team seeing pelvic pain patients together in a clinic setting , with a set of questions regarding these patients . disagreements on methods ( eg , the best way to examine the pelvic floor musculature ) were incorporated as questions to be answered by the grant . thus , this study is noteworthy for its true interdisciplinary nature , from conception to implementation , and there was strong investment in the grant by the research team . although such a process takes longer , the authors believe the design quality was higher , and the scientific questions posed were more clinically relevant . the board reflects the interdisciplinary composition nature of the research team and is comprised of a psychophysiologist with expertise in heart rate variability and stress responses , a pelvic pain neurologist , an urologist , a gynecologist specializing in pelvic pain and detailed vulvar examinations , a psychiatrist , and a sleep specialist . the board provided refinements to the study and helped validate that the project was capable of addressing important questions with an adequately sophisticated design . a simple issue pertained to the practicality of scheduling meetings for 20 busy surgeons and clinicians . this was initially addressed by scheduling monthly conference calls at an optimal time with topical discussions that were highly relevant and intellectually stimulating . an investigator newsletter was implemented as a means of maintaining investigator engagement and transparent communication . the collaboration of disciplines that usually do not understand each other s technical terms required significant education , with an initially steep learning curve . cross - disciplinary training for standardization of pelvic floor , neurologic , and urologic examinations conducted during study visits was completed by each investigator . this was a highly rewarding process for investigators from varied disciplines , resulting in novel questions on each area driven by an entirely fresh perspective . another set of challenges arose from sheer study size . a protocol comprised of multiple investigators from different departments and medical centers required multiple revisions in order to obtain institutional review board approval . urologists and gynecologists have different views on methodology and the relative importance of different portions of the examinations . it took several months of re - evaluations and standardization to obtain a final protocol , a feat not possible without the guidance and expertise of the icepac study advisory board members . the number of investigators , of whom consensus was required , slowed attempts to modify the study . exploration of new ideas or protocol modifications , such as assessment of sleep pattern and sleep disorder causality or measurement of stress and tight junction related cytokines in serum in subjects undergoing the trier social stress test , require more discussion and take longer to implement . as a result , however , the design is more likely to be embraced by specialists in diverse areas of medicine ( eg , urologists , gynecologists ) . the number of physicians trained to perform study visits ( which was the only way to recruit the large number of subjects proposed ) required particular attention to investigator training ( described in methods ) and protocol standardization . to this end , attention was paid to protocol scripts , and most of these were designed to be read and controlled by the ra rather than the investigator , which minimizes protocol variability . for example , semi - quantitative tuning forks29 ( us neurologicals llc , poulsbo , wa , usa ) for the assessment of vibration sensation were introduced , the temperature of the hot water stimulus was standardized to 115f , and a digital algometer ( model fdix 10 ; wagner instruments ) to standardize the force used to assess pin sensation to 0.55 n ( about 2 oz ) were implemented as part of standard operating procedure . selection of the psychological questionnaires required great care , ensuring that appropriate psychological constructs were evaluated while simultaneously limiting the time requirement burden on subjects and reducing the impact on statistical power of the number of variables employed . after extensive discussion and consideration of alternatives , the advisory board ultimately supported the selection of psychological proposed instruments . the psychological questionnaire set includes 313 questions and the odysa either 158 or 330 questions , depending on the subject s symptomatic history . though all subjects have completed the question set to date , a small number of subjects have expressed concern about questionnaire time burden . breaks are offered in the process and no time constraints are placed on subjects to complete the questionnaires . the database had to be accessible by subjects for entry but not for look - up , and specific layouts needed to remain inaccessible to some team members while accessible to others ( eg , demographic and diagnostic information needed to be blinded to the investigator to eliminate bias ) . using the filemaker server and database platform in cooperation with university hospitals information technology and solutions allowed the authors to design a database with all of these features , which may well be useful for other similar studies in the future . this level of sophistication though required the fulltime effort of a data manager for 3 years . as with all studies on pelvic pain , recruitment presents a challenge . in an effort to maintain study awareness , the pi , co - pi , and project manager visited each of the investigators to encourage active participation . investigators are invited to annual advisory board meetings to encourage a shared sense of academic participation and monthly phone conferences were conducted . advertisements were placed on several research subject recruitment websites and patient support organizations ( as outlined in the methods section ) . recruitment returns from the effort at the subject level far exceeded those from efforts at the investigator and provider level . recurrent communication with eight interested providers and potential collaborators from neighboring institutions resulted in few referrals . in contrast , promoting icepac study information to patient support groups , both regional and national , resulted in higher enrollment than referrals alone . the study utilizes the autonomic laboratory and clinic rooms for subject examinations that are also employed by patients for neurology and urology clinics . coordinating open times requires negotiation and reminders to hospital administration of the importance of the study in fostering clinical referrals . however , every effort is made to maintain an excellent working relationship with clinic staff and faculty , which results in excellent cooperation . when hospital staff turnover occurs , renewed educational efforts help replacement staff get up to speed on the study . icepac has been designed to allow careful phenotyping of subjects , which affords the novel identification of potentially important patient subgroups . the study is exploratory in nature , collecting a broad and comprehensive array of data , and its conclusions should generate specific , testable hypotheses that form the basis for future studies . moreover , icepac can be seen as a template for the study of other complex pain phenomena , such as gastrointestinal and other visceral and nonvisceral referred pain . as of december 2012 , data collection has been completed for 25 healthy controls , 33 ic / bps  mpp , eight mpp , and three family members . initially , the pi and co - pi were the main source of referrals , but this pattern was not sustainable once clinic populations were exhausted . efforts at maintaining contact with investigators to encourage referrals have led to gradual referral growth across a broader group of referrers . study investigators are kept up - to - date on study progress through an icepac investigator newsletter , which also serves as a reminder to refer . to date , the only adverse events have

recruit the large number of subjects proposed ) required particular attention to investigator training ( described in methods ) and protocol standardization . to this end , attention was paid to protocol scripts , and most of these were designed to be read and controlled by the ra rather than the investigator , which minimizes protocol variability . for example , semi - quantitative tuning forks29 ( us neurologicals llc , poulsbo , wa , usa ) for the assessment of vibration sensation were introduced , the temperature of the hot water stimulus was standardized to 115f , and a digital algometer ( model fdix 10 ; wagner instruments ) to standardize the force used to assess pin sensation to 0.55 n ( about 2 oz ) were implemented as part of standard operating procedure . selection of the psychological questionnaires required great care , ensuring that appropriate psychological constructs were evaluated while simultaneously limiting the time requirement burden on subjects and reducing the impact on statistical power of the number of variables employed . after extensive discussion and consideration of alternatives , the advisory board ultimately supported the selection of psychological proposed instruments . the psychological questionnaire set includes 313 questions and the odysa either 158 or 330 questions , depending on the subject s symptomatic history . though all subjects have completed the question set to date , a small number of subjects have expressed concern about questionnaire time burden . breaks are offered in the process and no time constraints are placed on subjects to complete the questionnaires . the database presented some informatics challenges . with current privacy regulations and concerns , the database had to be accessible by subjects for entry but not for look - up , and specific layouts needed to remain inaccessible to some team members while accessible to others ( eg , demographic and diagnostic information needed to be blinded to the investigator to eliminate bias ) . using the filemaker server and database platform in cooperation with university hospitals information technology and solutions allowed the authors to design a database with all of these features , which may well be useful for other similar studies in the future . this level of sophistication though required the fulltime effort of a data manager for 3 years . as with all studies on pelvic pain , recruitment presents a challenge . in an effort to maintain study awareness , the pi , co - pi , and project manager visited each of the investigators to encourage active participation investigators are invited to annual advisory board meetings to encourage a shared sense of academic participation and monthly phone conferences were conducted . advertisements were placed on several research subject recruitment websites and patient support organizations ( as outlined in the methods section ) . recruitment returns from the effort at the subject level far exceeded those from efforts at the investigator and provider level . recurrent communication with eight interested providers and potential collaborators from neighboring institutions resulted in few referrals . in contrast , promoting icepac study information to patient support groups , both regional and national , resulted in higher enrollment than referrals alone . the study utilizes the autonomic laboratory and clinic rooms for subject examinations that are also employed by patients for neurology and urology clinics . coordinating open times requires negotiation and reminders to hospital administration of the importance of the study in fostering clinical referrals . however , every effort is made to maintain an excellent working relationship with clinic staff and faculty , which results in excellent cooperation . when hospital staff turnover occurs , renewed educational efforts help replacement staff get up to speed on the study . icepac has been designed to allow careful phenotyping of subjects , which affords the novel identification of potentially important patient subgroups . the study is exploratory in nature , collecting a broad and comprehensive array of data , and its conclusions should generate specific , testable hypotheses that form the basis for future studies . moreover , icepac can be seen as a template for the study of other complex pain phenomena , such as gastrointestinal and other visceral and nonvisceral referred pain . the icepac study represents a comprehensive , interdisciplinary approach to understanding the autonomic and psychophysiologic characteristics of ic / bps . the study has proven feasible to date , although it is too early to report findings . the major obstacles have been by - products of the different perspectives and areas of expertise that a diverse group of investigators has brought , which , interestingly has also been one of the study s greatest strengths . that is , as perspectives have been shared and a common approach has been forged , each specialty has benefited by the input of the others . the investigators are hopeful that the findings of the icepac study will reflect the strength of this collaborative process .","background and purposeinterstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome ( ic / bps ) is relatively common and associated with severe pain , yet effective treatment remains elusive .

"pilomatricoma also known as benign calcifying epithelioma of malherbe is an uncommon slow growing benign adnexal skin tumor , which differentiates towards the hair matrix . , we report a case of pilomatricoma with bullous appearance in a young female which is rare , and also review the literature on bullous pilomatricoma . a 17-year - old girl presented with a solitary reddish semi - transparent blister over her right upper arm since 3 months . initially , the lesion started as a solid pin - head sized papule , which gradually progressed to form a semi - transparent blister with a hard nodule inside . no history of similar lesions in the past or in family members . on examination , single 2 cm sized erythematous semi - transparent bullae with a white nodule was seen on the medial aspect of the right upper arm [ figure 1a and b ] . on palpation , the bullae had a jelly like consistency and the nodule underneath was hard . on puncturing the lesion , it oozed a jelly like material .

"mindfulness refers to an awareness that emerges by paying attention to purpose and to the present moment and nonjudgmentally focusing on the unfolding of one 's immediate experience . more recently , mindfulness has been proposed as a cognitive behavior , rather than physiological , paradigm for meditation . mindfulness aims to develop enhanced awareness of the moment - to - moment experience of perceptible mental processes and forms an important component of meditation practices . initially , a meditator engages in focused concentration or attention over an object and as one grows in his practice , he leans towards the attentional disengagement or open monitoring . meditation imbibes an initial phase of mindfulness , making mindfulness a key determinant of meditation practice . during the last decade , several studies have been conducted across the globe to report the development of mindfulness and its effects on health and well - being . one such study conducted on a martial art technique  aikido using a mindfulness attention awareness scale ( maas ) concluded that consistent practice of aikido leads to development of mindfulness . another study on insomnia in menopausal women reported that postmenopausal women with insomnia are less mindful than women without insomnia , thereby concluding that mindfulness - based interventions , such as meditation , may be beneficial for postmenopausal insomnia . a study assessing the health risk behavior in adolescents concluded that mindfulness possibly shields against decision - making processes that place adolescents at risk for smoking . there are several others studies looking at the effects of mindfulness on neurological and psychiatric diseases and also assessing the levels of mindfulness in normal and diseased individuals . one of the studies reviewing the instruments of measuring mindfulness concluded that the maas was used by most studies ( n = 27 ) and had positive overall quality ratings for most of the psychometric properties reviewed . given the fact that past studies have looked at the levels of mindfulness in various practices , health and disease conditions , we planned the current study to asses the levels of mindfulness in a moving meditation practice . one of the various forms of mindfulness is the practice of a unique technique called cyclic mediation ( cm ) . it was fundamentally designed for novice practitioners and combines the practice of yoga postures with guided meditation . cm is known to induce a quiet state of mind , which is compatible with the description of meditation ( dhyana or effortless expansion ) , according to patanjali . although this moving meditation differs from the classic description of meditation , in which the practitioners remain seated , keeping as still as possible , the mental state in both practices ( moving meditation and seated practices ) is supposed to be comparable . an essential part of the practice of cm is being aware of sensations arising in the body , which emphasize the mindful component . there have been several studies which have proven the beneficial effects of cm . in one of the studies conducted on middle managers , cm program decreased occupational stress levels and baseline autonomic arousal in 26 asymptomatic , studies conducted to ascertain the effects of cm practice reported a decreased oxygen consumption indicating physiological relaxation as in mindfulness . few studies looking at the immediate effects of cm concluded that it improves attention , cognition , enhances slow wave sleep , and reduces anxiety . mindful yoga practices ( like cm ) may generate the state of mindfulness , which , when evoked recurrently through repeated practice , may accrue into trait or dispositional mindfulness . despite several studies on cm , none have reported its mindful component . the current study aimed at investigating the level of mindfulness in experienced cyclic meditators . we also report the correlation between the years of meditation experience and the level of mindfulness . one hundred and thirty - three ( n = 133 ) healthy male volunteers ( 66 meditators and 67 non - meditators ) with ages ranging from 25 to 35 years [ group mean age  standard deviation ( s.d . ) , 24.6  4.5 for meditators and 24.1  4.7 for non - meditators ] participated in the study . meditators were selected from s - vyasa yoga university , south india and corresponding non - meditators ( controls ) matched for age , gender , and education were obtained from similar institutes in bangalore , india . meditators had a minimum 3 years experience of meditation ( group mean experience  s.d . , 5.12  1.35 years ) . non - meditators had no exposure to any yoga practices and were unaware of the aims of the study . subjects with cognitive deficits ruled out by routine clinical examination were excluded from the study . this study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and a signed informed consent was obtained from all the subjects following explanation of the study . the questionnaire was administered in a classroom setup ( for approximately 30 min ) and two of the project coordinators were present to supervise the administration and to assist the participants where necessary . all the participants filled out the questionnaire , but for whom more than 10% of the items were missing or whose reports were considered unreliable ( i.e. , consistently rated the highest or the lowest scores on all items ) , were excluded from the analyses ( n = 06 ; 4% ) . the subjects participating in this study had higher educational qualifications with almost 90% of the participants being postgraduates . this was a cross - sectional study , where subjects ( meditators ) were recruited from s - vyasa yoga university and other universities ( non - meditators ) by convenience sampling . maas is a 15-item self - reported single - factor scale that is exclusively focused on attention / awareness component of mindfulness construct . this instrument has been independently used to assess individuals either with or without meditation experience . this scale has been widely used for various studies and has reported positive overall quality ratings for most of the psychometric properties reviewed . maas is a brief , easy to administer scale , and has therefore been used in wide range of studies related to assessing mindfulness trait . maas is known to have good reliability ratings and a history of clinical and research use that was developed to assess the core attentional aspect of mindfulness , and the capacity for moment - to - moment attention in particular . the maas consists of 15 items that measure the level of mindfulness ( example items are i could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until some time later  , or i find it difficult to stay focused on what 's happening in the present  ) . the items are answered on a six - point scale ( 1 = almost always ; 6 = almost never ) on which higher scores are an indication of higher trait mindfulness . the maas has been validated in various samples of students (  = 0.82 ) and adults from the general community (  = 0.87 ) . the questionnaire was scored by computing a mean of the 15 items in the questionnaire . the data were checked for normality and an independent samples t - test was employed to compare the means of both the groups . we also calculated the partial correlation ( r ) between the years of meditation experience against the levels of mindfulness . for all the analysis , we present 95% confidence intervals and considered p < 0.05 as significant . this was a cross - sectional study , where subjects ( meditators ) were recruited from s - vyasa yoga university and other universities ( non - meditators ) by convenience sampling . maas is a 15-item self - reported single -

meditators ( independent samples t - test , t = 10.391 , p < 0.001 ) . the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the levels of mindfulness trait between meditators and non - meditators was ( 1.05 , 1.55 ) . we found a positive correlation ( r = 0.620 ) between the years of meditation practice and the levels of trait mindfulness . mean total scores of meditators and non - meditators on the mindfulness attention awareness scale . in the present study , we studied trait mindfulness and its correlation with duration of meditation practice using a maas . we found that meditators had higher levels of trait mindfulness and were positively correlated with the duration of meditation practice . while there are known differences between buddhist views of mindfulness and modern psychological adaptations , there is broad agreement that a clearly formulated mental training , usually referred to as meditation , the practice of cm involves physical postures ( asanas ) , breath work , physical and mental awareness together leading to a state of meditation . according to patanjali , development of meditation ( dhayana ) is a process and takes a series of practices , which together are called ashtanga yoga  the eightfold path to reach the highest state of consciousness . one reaches the state of mindfulness or meditation or antaranga yoga as a result of continued and consistent practice of the first six limbs of yoga . our results are very much in accordance with patanajali 's concept of the process of development of mindfulness and meditation . another school of yoga , hatha yoga comprises practices of postures , breath work , and cleansing practices , all aimed at striking a balance between the body and the mind . consistent practice of these hatha yoga techniques transforms the practitioner and establishes him in the state of mindfulness and meditation . the meditation technique practiced in the current study comprises all these components , which justifies the higher levels of mindfulness in the meditation group . also , higher levels of trait mindfulness in cm practitioner can be accredited to the years of cm practice , which would have lead to the development of mindful trait in the meditators as signified by the positive correlation between level of mindfulness and the duration of meditation practice . the findings of the present study are in line with earlier studies on trait mindfulness in meditators . highly experienced zen meditators showed similar trends where levels of mindfulness were found to have strong positive correlation to the years of meditation experience . the results of this study indicate that maas is sensitive to individual differences in levels of mindfulness and suggest that the higher scores among those consciously practicing this skill are due to such training . an 8-week mindfulness - based stress reduction ( mbsr ) program showed increase in the trait mindfulness of the participants , which mediate the effects of training on clinical outcomes . in a similar study , 8 weeks of yoga training resulted in significant increases in trait mindfulness of practitioners . another study with cancer patients undergoing 8-weeks of mbsr , showed improved levels of mindfulness and lowered mood disturbances and symptoms of stress . a similar study like ours , comparing two different meditation techniques concluded that meditation improves the levels of mindfulness regardless of the meditation technique . studies explaining the underlying mechanisms of development of mindfulness have been its stage of infancy . however , if mindfulness is considered to be a component of self - awareness and meditation , one of the studies reports the role of frontal control systems in neuroanatomical models of self - awareness . several neuroimaging and electroencephalograpy ( eeg)/event related potentials ( erp ) studies have shown changes in activation of prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) and the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) , as well as significant increases in alpha and theta activity during meditation there is substantial evidence of changes in pfc during mindfulness meditation , which is known to be associated with attention , concentration , and emotion regulation . in another study , individuals with higher levels of mindfulness demonstrated less emotional reactivity in the midbrain ( amygdala , dorsal acc ) , which is likely due to an enhanced ability to engage the pfc . functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing experienced mindfulness meditators and novice controls have suggested increased neuronal activity in regions of the brain related to self - awareness ( e.g. , dorsolateral and medial pfc ) , particularly momentary self - awareness / self - reference . majority of the studies on mindfulness meditation and other mindfulness training programs have demonstrated significant changes in the pfc . these findings show promise for the individual 's ability to train the mind , changing not only emotional experiences , but also brain structure and functioning ; moreover , the ability to do so appears to improve over time as experience with meditation increases . one of the limitations of our study is that the meditators participating in this study lived in a yoga institute and practiced other yoga techniques . therefore , we are not sure if the development of higher levels of mindfulness is due to the meditation practice or an influence of other yoga practices . further studies should be conducted on subjects practicing only cm and not adhering to any other yoga practices . another limitation could be the small sample size . given the huge number of yoga practitioners in today 's date , studies with larger sample sizes are warranted . consistent practice of moving meditation practices like cm can lead to development of higher levels of mindfulness . this may positively impact mental states and attention , which can in turn help psychological well - being of individuals . this furthers the scope for clinical trials with cm as an intervention in the management of psychological disorders .","context : mindfulness forms an important component of meditation practice and has been increasingly popular around the world . 
 there has been growing interest in studying the mindful component of various meditation techniques . 
 one of the various forms of mindfulness is the practice of a unique technique called cyclic mediation ( cm ) . 
 we aimed at ascertaining the level of mindfulness in experienced practitioners of cm using a mindfulness attention awareness scale ( maas).materials and methods : maas was administered anonymously in a classroom setup and two of the project coordinators were present to supervise the administration and to assist the participants where necessary . 
 we executed a cross sectional design . 
 one hundred and thirty - three ( n = 133 ) healthy male volunteers ( 66 meditators and 67 non - meditators ) with ages ranging from 25 to 35 years participated in the study . 
 meditators had a minimum 3 years experience of meditation.results:data were analyzed using ibm spss 20 . 
 the data were checked for normality and an independent samples t - test was employed to compare the means of both the groups . 
 maas scores were significantly higher in meditators as compared with the non - meditators ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 we found a positive correlation ( r = 0.620 ) between the years of meditation practice and the levels of trait mindfulness.conclusions:cm can lead to development of higher levels of mindfulness and may have the ability to positively impact mental states and attention , thereby offering the potential for prevention of clinical levels of psychopathology and improving overall psychological well - being in healthy individuals .",322
"asymptomatic carotid plaques are very commonly encountered in daily clinical practice , with prevalence ranging from 0.1% to 7.5% in the general population . asymptomatic carotid stenosis refers to narrowing of the carotid artery caused by atherosclerosis in patients who have not experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack in the territory of that artery . the pathogenesis of carotid plaque from asymptomatic to cerebrovascular events is a complex process which is still not completely understood . although many systemic risk factors predispose to development of atherosclerosis , plaque is not uniformly distributed in the carotid arteries and it preferentially affects certain regions of circulation ( e.g. , the inner curve , close to side branches , and in the bulbs of the carotid artery [ 46 ] ) , suggesting that local mechanical factors might determine plaque development and growth . plaque morphology and composition are evidently related to blood flow , which therefore influences the local predisposition to atherosclerosis progression , plaque rupture , and thrombosis . furthermore , there is ample evidence that low wall shear stress is involved in plaque initiation and progression through various molecular mechanisms that influence endothelial cell morphology and function . atherosclerosis is considered to be a disease caused by a variety of clinical environmental factors and genetic factors . in recent years , numerous polymorphisms of genes related to atherosclerosis have been found by genome - wide association study ( gwas ) and meta - analysis in large - scale studies [ 913 ] . on the other hands , other hemodynamic parameters related to atherosclerosis include wall pressure , shear strain rates , and flow velocity . cfd is mechanical engineering field which is widely used in mechanical engineering to solve complex problems by analyzing fluid flow , heat transfer , and associated phenomena by using computer simulations . examples are aerodynamics and hydrodynamics of vehicles , power plants and turbines , electronic engineering , chemical engineering , external and internal environmental architectural design , marine and environmental engineering , hydrology , meteorology , and biomedical engineering . in recent years , cfd biomedical research is more accessible because high - performance hardware and software are easily available with advances in computer science . few studies have investigated the relationship between carotid plaque hemodynamic characteristics and risk of stroke in asymptomatic patients . therefore , in this study , we aimed to investigate the relationship between hemodynamic parameters of asymptomatic carotid plaques by using cfd and magnetic resonance angiography ( mra ) , including flow velocity across the lesion , wall shear stress ( wss ) , wall pressure ( wp ) , and the risk of stroke . this prospective study was performed at the chinese pla general hospital , beijing , china from march 2011 to june 2013 . for the purpose of our study , asymptomatic participants with carotid plaque ( thickness 2 mm ) in one of the carotid arteries were enrolled . the exclusion criteria included : 1 ) images were not suitable for cfd analysis : the stenosis degree greater than 95% or less than 10% ; and 2 ) contraindications for mra : any electrically , magnetically , or mechanically activated implant , intracranial aneurysm clips ( unless made of titanium ) , ferromagnetic surgical clips or staples , metallic foreign body in the eye , or pregnancy . demographics , histories of common diseases ( previously diagnosed or taking corresponding medications at baseline ) , and results of laboratory tests at baseline were collected from computerized medical records and ultrasound reports . the primary endpoint was defined as a stroke based on typical clinical symptoms and confirmed by follow - up brain ct or mra . secondary endpoints included any ischemic stroke or tia , and all - cause death . a flow chart explaining the final data used for analysis is shown in figure 1 . the participants were divided into a stroke group and a non - stroke group according to follow - up data . written informed consent the study was approved by the ethics committee for medical research of the chinese pla general hospital . carotid plaques mras were obtained by a signal 1.5 t mr systems ( general - electric healthcare , milwaukee , wi ) using a bilateral phased - array surface coil with a slice thickness of 1.2 mm . mra scan range was from the aortic arch to the skull base , and we selected the 4 cm within the scope of the original image of the carotid bifurcation ( i.e. , within the 4-cm scope of the cca , ica , and eca ) . after the scan was completed , the digital imaging and communications in medicine ( dicom ) format images were derived . all images were imported to the post - processing workstation adw4.5 - 1 ( general - electric healthcare , milwaukee , wi ) for image evaluation and analysis . luminal area ( la ) was defined as the area encompassed by the inner boundary of the intimal surface in plaque slices . total vessel area ( tva ) was defined by the outer boundary of the vessel . wall area ( wa ) was calculated by the software , subtracting tva from la ( wa = tvala ) . geometric modeling was performed by importing the dicom format mra data into reverse engineering 3d reconstruction software mimics ( materialise inc . , belgium ) , by threshold segmentation ( figure 2a ) , region growing , and use of mask film editing ( figure 2b ) tools to get a sense of vessels in the region of interest ( roi ) mask by mimics the 3-dimensional ( 3d ) transport calculation functions , connection of the extracted two - dimensional ( 2d ) section , and generating a 3d carotid arteries geometric model ( figure 2c ) . we then imported the 3d models into the forward engineering software 3-matic to remesh the surface of the arteries ( figure 2d ) and improve the quality of the grid . we imported stl format images into the icem - cfd software to identify the 3d space structure , and defined the 1-inlet , 2-outlets , the vessel wall , and other parts of arteries . then , we set the parameters required for the tetrahedral mesh according to the size of the arteries . to guarantee the accuracy of the boundary of the target artery , we set up a 3-layer boundary calculate condition , and the growth factor was increased by 1.2 times . we imported tetrahedral mesh files into a fluent model with ansys software and set the following boundary conditions : ( 1 ) vascular wall characteristics : vascular walls were set to smooth , no penetration of rigid ; ( 2 ) blood characteristics : the blood flow was assumed laminar , incompressible , and newtonian , with density of 1060 kg / m and viscosity of 0.0035pas ; ( 3 ) the inlet velocity was measured by mra and the blood flow of internal and external carotid arteries were 55% and 45% , respectively ;

specific inlet flow velocity measured by mra , which allowed us to get more accurate parameters of fluid dynamics . several studies have investigated the association between carotid plaques progression and risk of cerebrovascular events in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [ 1,22,2428 ] . these risk factors including age , sex , severity of stenosis , increased plaque area , carotid artery end - diastolic velocity , systolic blood pressure , and increased serum creatinine . our analysis suggests that plaque morphology characteristics nwi and hemodynamics parameter wss are independent risk factors for the progression from asymptomatic to stroke . logistics regression analysis and roc curve suggest that the combination of nwi and wss is better at predicting the risk of stroke . during the early stages of atherosclerotic plaque growth , the vessel may remodel and accommodate plaque growth without compromising luminal size . there are few plaque morphology characteristics , such as wa , used to assess plaques . clinical trials have shown that in human carotid arteries , luminal stenosis has limited value as an indicator of atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability , enabling prediction of only 1 of 10 strokes in asymptomatic patients . plaque burden , which is represented by plaque volume and maximum wall area ( mwa ) , as a direct measure of the lesion itself , may have substantial usefulness in the assessment of atherosclerosis . studies have shown nwi is a sensitive factor for early detection of carotid atherosclerosis plaques , and it can reflect the progression of plaque more accurately than other morphology characteristics such as la and wa . calculated as wa / tva , nwi contains information about lumen stenosis and thickening of the wall , which make nwi is the most effective indicator for evaluating the severity of atherosclerosis . furthermore , it can avoid the difference in the wall area caused by different vascular thicknesses . therefore , nwi may also be used as a dynamic index to measure the dynamic changes of plaques . even though morphology characteristics of plaques were thought to relate to the progression of local lesion , as mentioned above , plaque rupture is not solely dependent on plaque morphology , and other local factors are probably involved . as a consequence of improvements in imaging of atherosclerosis and in computational power , there is increasing evidence that hemodynamic factors are important in the atherogenic process and in the development of unstable plaque and thromboembolic stroke . disturbances of hemodynamics are thought to have a role in several aspects of this process , particularly in the causation of plaque rupture and in the formation of surface thrombus . the follow - up radiographic results confirmed that the culprit sites were consistent with the regions of high wss . wss is the parallel frictional force exerted by blood flow on the endoluminal surface of the arterial wall . the magnitude of wss is influenced by changes in luminal geometry , blood flow velocity , and plasma viscosity . although studies suggested that a certain degree of high wss has anti - atherosclerosis effect , the increase of wss is not necessarily a protective factor for atherosclerosis . lovett   showed that plaque ruptures more frequently in the upper side of the lumen , which is affected by the high wss and leads to the production of vulnerable plaque with a thin fibrous cap . studies of clinical pathological autopsies also showed that plaque rupture mainly occurred in the upper side of the lesion , consistent with the area of high wss . although the absolute value of the wss is not enough to directly damage the structure of the fiber cap , the increased wss in the upper side of the lesion is the primary factor causing rupture of the plaque . studies have confirmed that wss is associated with regulation of many vascular functions , such as maintenance of acute vessel tone , vascular permeability , adhesion of leukocytes , development of blood vessels , and secretion of pro - thrombotic and antithrombotic signaling molecules . activated ecs produce chemokines , cytokines , and adhesion molecules that interact with leukocytes and platelets , and target inflammation to specific tissues as a host defense mechanism . balaguru s team developed a versatile model based on cfd simulation to explore the shear stress - associated changes of biological function in endothelial cells ( ecs ) . cell morphology , cytoskeletal arrangement , cell death , reactive oxygen species profile , nitric oxide production , and disturbed flow markers under certain wss condition were assessed . they observed a 2~4-fold increase in vegfr2 expression in high - wss regions , but the increase in expression was not observed in low - wss areas . mcp-1 involved in the recruitment of leukocytes plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerotic plaque formation . there was a 2-fold increase in expression of hif1- in high - wss regions , and a less than 2-fold increase in low - wss areas . plaques that contain a large lipid - rich necrotic core , intraplaque hemorrhage , inflammation , and/or are covered by a thin fibrous cap are considered the most vulnerable to rupture . in animal studies and small case studies , an association between wss and plaque composition was observed . although low wss may induce plaque initiation , it has been hypothesized that plaque destabilization can be caused by high shear stress on the plaque . tuenter s study evaluated the association between shear stress and plaque components in asymptomatic persons . we found that the combination of plaque morphology characteristics nwi and hemodynamics parameter wss can improve the ability to identify patients at highest risk of rapid disease progression and may predict the risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid plaques . more prospective studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to validate the findings of this study and to discover new risk factors for imaging and fluid mechanics .","backgroundatherosclerosis plaques in the carotid arteries frequently have been found in patients with stroke . however , the pathogenesis of carotid plaque from asymptomatic to cerebrovascular events is a complex process which is still not completely understood . 
 we aimed to investigate the prognosis of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques by use of magnetic resonance angiography ( mra ) combined with computational fluid dynamics ( cfd).material / methodswe prospectively studied a cohort of 228 participants ( mean age 59.218.48 ) with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques ; mean follow - up duration was 1147.56224.84 days .

 independent risk factors for stroke were obtained by cox regression analysis . 
 the area under the curve ( auc ) of receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) and z - statistic test were used to evaluate risk factors.resultslogistics regression analysis showed nwi ( or : 3.472 , 95% ci : 2.9434.096 , p=0.11 ) and wss ( or : 6.974 , 95% ci : 1.07045.453 , p=0.42 ) were independent risk factors of stroke for patients with asymptomatic carotid plaques . 
 the area under the roc curve values for wss , nwi , and wss+nwi were 0.772 , 0.798 , and 0.903 , respectively.conclusionsthe combination of plaque morphology characteristics nwi and hemodynamic parameter wss may predict the risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid plaques .",407
"light - cured composite resins are being more used specially because they are 
 aesthetically advantageous and enable to be polymerized by physical and chemical 
 activators . however , the crucial point to be reached during 
 restorative dentistry procedures with composite resins is to obtain satisfactory 
 restorations with an adequate light activation technique . composites consist mainly of filler particles and a resin matrix based on different 
 monomers . currently , the most 
 widely marketed composite resins are based on the polymerization of bisphenol a glycol 
 dimethacrylate ( bis - gma ) and urethane dimethacrylate ( udma ) . the curing process occurs in the organic matrix where 
 there is a monomer - polymer conversion through an activation mechanism . however , an insufficient degree of 
 conversion directly affects the physical properties and chemical stability of 
 material . polymers used in the 
 composition of composite resins may absorb water and chemicals from the oral environment 
 ( sorption ) and may release some of their own components ( solubility ) . restorations are subject to tension due to chewing when an excessive 
 or continue non - functional load is applied , internal stresses and strain are generated 
 which can cause the material failure . in this context , the adequate polymerization plays an important role on the longevity of 
 composite resin restorations . this procedure requires sufficient light energy intensity 
 and an adequate wavelength in order to activate the photoinitiator within these 
 materials , which will react with the reducer agent to form free radicals and initiate 
 the polymerization process . variables such as adequate light intensity , correct wavelength and energy density ( power 
 density x exposure time ) are essential for achieving the proper depth of cure . different types of light curing units 
 have been proposed for the polymerization of light activated resinous materials 
 including conventional quartz tungsten halogen ( qth ) lamp , plasma arc , argon laser and 
 light - emitting diodes ( led ) . all these devices emit blue light in the spectrum of the 
 absorption of camphorquinone , which is the photoinitiator generally found in most 
 resinous material . the qth lights can 
 achieve satisfactory results , but they present certain limitations such as shorter 
 durability of the lamp and heat production . led have been recognized as a promising technology for 
 polymerization of resin - based materials because all the light emitted is within the 
 spectrum of maximum absorption of camphorquinone at 468 nm . different curing regimes can exert an influence on the resistance of the union , hardness 
 and crosslinking density . when high 
 power density is applied , more photoinitiator molecules are activated at the same time 
 and consequently acceleration occurs immediately upon light exposure , thereby generating 
 inner stresses that are confined into composite , dental structure and 
 interfaces . in the pulse - delay ( pd ) polymerization technique there is a decrease in shrinkage and 
 stress . in this technique , there is a short period ( about 1 - 3 min ) between initial exposition and final 
 cure . the interval between 
 both pulses , an initial pulse with low energy density and a final pulse with high light 
 irradiation , increases the composite resin pre - gel phase improving its flowability and 
 relieving the stress generate by composite shrinkage . it has been hypothesized that low power densities , 
 characterized by reduced power density in the initial seconds , may generate a small 
 number of free radicals . then , a more linear polymeric structure is obtained , with lower 
 crosslinking density , which negatively affects the material 's chemical and physical 
 properties . a previous 
 study concluded that marginal 
 integrity of restorations and the composite "" plasticizing effect "" are negatively 
 affected when a pd technique is used . the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different light sources , pd 
 curing protocols and storage media on sorption , solubility and biaxial flexural strength 
 ( bfs ) of a composite resin . the null hypotheses tested were : ( 1 ) qth and led curing 
 light units using different energy densities produce no influence on sorption , 
 solubility and bfs ; ( 2 ) qth and led curing light units using different curing techniques 
 produce no influence on sorption , solubility and bfs ; ( 3 ) storage procedure in water and 
 ethanol produces no influence on sorption , solubility and bfs . a nanohybrid composite resin ( esthet - x , dentsply , rio de janeiro , rj , brazil ) ( batch

 piston - on - ring flexural strength test . specimens were made using a stainless steel mold with 2 mm in thick

 prior to use to ensure consistency of light output . a single increment of composite 
 material was placed into a stainless steel mold and confined between two opposing 
 polyester strips ( k - dent , quimidrol , joinville , sc , brazil ) . the specimens were then removed from the mold and 
 excesses were eliminated with a scalpel blade ( free - bac , wuxi xinda medical device

 specimens were removed from the oven and placed on a bench for 2 h , at a temperature 
 of 231c , completing a cycle of 24 h. specimens were weighed daily on an analytical 
 scale accurate to 0.001 mg ( marte ay220 , marte balanas e aparelhos de preciso ltda ,

 mass ( m1 ) was obtained , that is , until the mass loss of each specimen was not more 
 than 0.1 mg per 24 h cycle . afterwards , the specimens were returned to their 
 respective labeled bottles , and 15 ml of either deionized water or 75% ethanol were 
 added with manual pipettes . the bottles were capped , replaced in the oven and kept at 
 371c for 28 days . after this period , all bottles were removed from the oven and kept at room 
 temperature , 231c for 2 h. the specimens were removed from the bottles , dried with 
 absorbent paper for 15 s and left in a sterile bucket ( duflex , sswhite , rio de

 specimens were returned to the desiccators until they reached a constant weight ( m3 ) 
 using the same procedure described to obtain m1 . the values for water sorption and solubility were calculated in g / mm

 mass of the specimen after immersion into storage media in mg , m3 was a final mass of 
 the specimen recorded after to evaporation of the water or ethanol in mg , and v was a 
 volume of the specimen in mm . after sorption and solubility tests , all specimens were submitted to a biaxial 
 piston - on - ring flexural strength test . the specimen was positioned on a circular 
 metallic device with 3 mm in radius that contain 3 symmetrically spaced steel 
 spheres . each specimen was placed concentrically on the supporting spheres to ensure 
 that the load was applied at the center of the specimen . a steel piston of 2 mm in 
 diameter was attached to a universal testing machine ( emic , dl2000 , so jos dos 
 pinhais , pr , brazil ) and the test was performed at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm / min 
 using a 50 kgf load cell until specimen failure . the bfs was calculated according to 
 the astm f394 - 78 specifications as follows : s=-0.2387 p(x - y)/d ; where s is the flexural strength in mpa , p is the 
 load at failure in n , and d is the specimen thickness in mm of the failure area . x 
 and y were determined as follows : x=(1+v ) ln ( b / c)+[(1-v)/2 ]

 where v is poisson 's ratio of the composite resin ( 0.24 ) , a is the radius of the support circle , b is the

 analysis of variance and tukey 's tests for parametric values , and kruskal - wallis and 
 mann - whitney tests for non - parametric values ( =0.05 ) . pearson 's correlation was used 
 to verify the correlation among the sorption , solubility and bfs . all tests were 
 performed using the spss 17.0 for windows statistics software ( spss inc . , chicago ,

 radius of the tip of the piston , and c is the radius of the specimen . data obtained from the sorption , solubility and bfs tests were subjected to three - way 
 analysis of variance and tukey 's tests for parametric values , and kruskal - wallis and 
 mann - whitney tests for non - parametric values ( =0.05 ) . pearson 's correlation was used 
 to verify the correlation among the sorption , solubility and bfs . all tests were 
 performed using the spss 17.0 for windows statistics software ( spss inc . , chicago , 
 il , usa ) . however , to 
 facilitate understanding , the data presented in the tables are the means of the groups 
 with their respective standard deviations ( s.d . ) . the results for sorption and 
 solubility at energy densities of 16 j / cm and 20 j / cm are shown 
 in tables 1 and 2 , respectively . in general , no significant difference was found between the 
 light sources and between the curing modes tested in this study ( p>0.05 ) . however , in 
 the interaction between permeant and light source with a density of 16 j / cm , 
 it was seen that the specimens light - cured with the led unit device in pd10s and stored 
 in ethanol led to higher values of sorption and solubility than those light - cured with 
 qth ( p<0.05 ) . ethanol showed higher sorption and solubility than water irrespective 
 of curing unit or curing method ( p<0.05 ) . means , standard deviations ( sd ) for comparison between light source and permeant

 statistical differences ( p>0.05 ) in the bfs there were interactions between light sources , curing modes and permeants at 
 an energy density of 16 j / cm ( p<0.05 ) ( table 3 ) , which did not occur at a density of 20 j / cm , where 
 there were significant differences only between the permeants ( water and ethanol ) ( table 4 ) . means , standard deviations ( sd ) for biaxial flexural strength at 16 
 j / cm values with same superscript capital letter ( a , b or c ) denote no statistical 
 differences ( p>0.05 ) means , standard deviations ( sd ) for biaxial flexural strength at 20 
 j / cm values in the same column with same superscript minute letter ( a or b ) denote 
 no statistical differences ( p>0.05 ) values in the same line with same superscript capital letter ( a or b ) denote no 
 statistical differences ( p>0.05 ) the correlation among sorption , solubility and bfs was performed by pearson 's 
 correlation coefficient test . otherwise , bfs were negatively correlated with sorption and 
 solubility ( table 5 ) . successful composite resin restoration depends on the association of low rate shrinkage , 
 good flowability , appropriate cure and satisfactory mechanical properties . led sources seem to be a promising 
 technology for polymerization of dental resin materials , but its application in 
 composite curing remains controversial . in this study , qth lamp was adopted as a control in order to 
 compare its performance with led . led units produce a narrow band of wavelengths 
 ( 450 - 490 nm ) , conveniently situated within the absorption spectrum of camphorquinone , 
 which is the photoinitiator present in the most of light - activated dental 
 materials . in general , the led 
 unit showed similar behavior to the qth unit , suggesting that similar polymerization 
 quality was reached by the equipment , except when led using 16 j / cm in pd10 
 s intensity produced higher values of sorption and solubility than qth ( p<0.05 ) . led 
 curing unit using cm at 16 j / cm produced lower values of bfs than qth used 
 with the same protocol ( p<0.05 ) . this fact could be associated with the greater heat 
 generated by the qth unit , which may speed up the polymer chain induction process in 
 composite , increasing the mobility of molecules during the reaction and allowing more 
 monomers to react before the curing process ends . the polymerization does not stop right after the photoactivation 
 period , and heat contributes for this post - activation polymerization . although camphorquinone presents its maximum absorbance at 
 468 nm , it has an absorption band ( 380 - 510 nm ) that is coincident with the light band 
 emitted by qth lamps resulting in more camphorquinone molecules being 
 activated . consequently , the 
 crosslinked polymer was probably lower in these led subgroups than in the corresponding 
 qth subgroups and more susceptible to softening in solvents . the size of the specimens used in this study differed from the iso 4049:2000 , as the standard dictates that they must 
 be 15 mm in diameter . this contrasts with the diameter of the light guide tip of the 
 curing units , which are 8 to 10 mm in diameter , and which would limit the uniform 
 irradiation throughout the circumference of the specimen . traditionally , the manufacturers have recommended high light intensity or power density 
 to provide a higher degree of monomer conversion into polymer , thereby improving the 
 mechanical properties of composite resin . high power density 
 used for short light exposures led to a lower degree of cure and lower flexural strength 
 and modulus than when the composite was cured with intermediary power densities for 
 longer exposures . in some 
 studies that used 24 j / cm of energy density , the 
 curing modes tested presented similar behavior . it has been speculated that this 
 occurred as a result of the formation of a densely crosslinked polymer network because 
 an adequate energy density had been used . the same finding was seen in this study in the groups that used 20 
 j / cm , where there were no significant differences between the subgroups 
 studied . the subgroups that used 16 j / cm presented different values of 
 sorption , solubility and bfs storage in ethanol for the qth and led units ( p<0.05 ) . the use of low initial intensity followed by high intensity light with an interval 
 between them seems to create a uniform polymerization of the composite resin , providing 
 its best adaptation to cavity walls and possibly the least polymerization contraction 
 stress . in the delay 
 period , little amount of free radicals and double bond conversion are produced and the 
 composite resin has more time to molecular rearrangement and stress relief . in the pd cure , there was reduced gap 
 formation without any mechanical properties being compromised , which can be considered 
 as an indicative that composite has the same quantity of remaining double 
 bonds . the use of slow - cure 
 methods ( pulse curing modes ) in combination with the interval between two irradiations 
 seem not to interfere with solvent sorption and could be useful for adhesive composite 
 restorations . in this study , 
 there were no significant differences among the curing modes in terms of sorption , 
 solubility and bfs ( p>0.05 ) except for qth comparing the cm and pd3s at 16 
 j / cm , where pd3s produced lower values of bfs than the cm ( p<0.05 ) . however , this 
 result was different from those of other studies , where the pd mode 
 resulted in a linear polymer structure that was less crosslinked , thereby increasing the 
 susceptibility of polymers to softening in ethanol . some studies 
 have shown a significant reduction in mechanical properties , such as flexural modulus 
 and hardness , when composites were photo - cured by pd mode and submitted to solvent 
 action . however , based on the methodology used in this study and the obtained results , 
 the curing modes presented similar behavior . according to lopes , et al . ( 2009 ) , this could have occurred because 
 another study used unfilled resins 
 for their tests instead of filled composite resin . another explanation for the 
 difference between the results of this study and that where the photo - cured composites 
 using the pd mode were more susceptible to softening in solvent could be attributed to 
 the type of tests applied to assess the amount of crosslinking , such as hardness 
 deterioration , degree of conversion and remaining double bonds , which only make an 
 indirect assessment of the quality of the polymer . the effect of the different solvents was clearly significant in all groups ; ethanol 
 resulted in more solubility , sorption and lower bfs than water media . 4049:2000 specifications , the storage time is 7 days , but in the 
 present study the storage time of 28 days in the same way as established for other 
 studies in which most of the composites studied reached 
 saturation within 7 - 60 days . the amount of solvent uptake by the polymer is determined 
 by differences in solubility parameters between the polymer and the permeant . water or solvent uptake into the resin 
 phase of cr causes two opposing processes : the solvent will extract unreacted 
 components , mainly monomer , thereby resulting in shrinkage , loss of weight and reduction 
 in mechanical properties ; conversely , solvent uptake leads to a swelling of the 
 composite resin and an increase in weight . these phenomena of sorption and solubility may serve as precursors 
 to a variety of chemical and physical processes which create biological concerns and 
 produce deleterious effects on the structure and function of the polymer 
 material . it is desirable that composites have all monomers converted into polymers during the 
 polymerization reaction and remain stable for long time . it may be assumed that , whereas the increase in the 
 degree of conversion reduced the solubility because the amount of unreacted monomers 
 available for leaching out was lower due to the high percentage of reacted aliphatic c = c 
 bonds from the dimethacrylate monomers . most dental polymers present ionic functional groups with water 
 affinity , which in turn optimizes their hydrophilicity . the susceptibility for more linear or less crosslinked 
 polymer to softening in solvents may be explained by the solvent - polymer interaction 
 and , consequently , by hoy 's solubility parameter for polar forces . solvents that can form strong secondary 
 bonds with the polymer chains can penetrate and replace the interchange secondary bonds , 
 and thereby pull apart and dissolve linear and branched polymers . distilled water , a solvent indicated in 
 iso specifications for resin - based 
 filling materials , simulates the wet intraoral environment provided by saliva and water . 
 however , intraoral conditions are clearly more complex than those achieved with 
 distilled water in the laboratory . according to the us food and drug administration guidelines , a 75% ethanol - water 
 solution is a clinically relevant food / oral simulating liquid . the 75% 
 ethanol solvent is the most frequently used to simulate accelerated ageing of 
 restorations as it has a solubility parameter matching that of bisgma when ethanol penetrates the polymer network , it causes the structure 
 swell , thereby allowing for the release of uncured monomers and causing the dissolution 
 of linear polymer chains . this 
 expansion is facilitated when crosslink density is low , based on the fact that more 
 space and pathways are available for solvent molecules to diffuse within the 
 structure . the properties of composite resins are affected by the degree of conversion , but an 
 analysis of the amount of crosslinking in the resins may provide a closer correlation to 
 mechanical properties . water 
 sorption may deteriorate polymer mechanical properties and because of this the resin 
 specimens were submitted to a mechanical test after the sorption and solubility tests . tensile strength is generally considered to be the most meaningful property of these 
 brittle materials in assessing the potential for failure of dental 
 restorations . flexural strength 
 can be measured using a three - point bending flexural test , a four - point bending flexural 
 test or a biaxial flexure test ; the drawback of the three - point and four - point flexural 
 tests is the inherent sensitivity to flaws and defect near specimen edges . as ban and anusavice ( 1990 ) related , the biaxial flexure test 
 is recognized as a reliable technique since the maximum tensile stress occurs within the 
 central loading area and edge failures are eliminated . in the evaluation of the correlation among the variables ( sorption , solubility and bfs ) , 
 it was possible to see how much higher the sorption and solubility were and how much 
 lower the bfs ( p<0.05 ) was . the degree of conversion and crosslink density can 
 influence the chemical degradation that is usually caused by oxidation and hydrolysis 
 processes , and consequently 
 reduce the physical and mechanical properties . thus , polymers with lower crosslink 
 densities are expected to undergo more softening in solvents , which results in greater sorption and solubility values 
 but lower bfs values . within the limitations of this in vitro study methodology , it was 
 concluded that , in general , the light sources ( qth and led ) and curing modes ( cm and pd ) 
 did not influence the sorption , solubility or bfs of the tested resin . however , the 
 different solvents ( water and ethanol ) did influence its sorption , solubility and bfs 
 behavior . the authors would like to thank nbia miranda ferreira ( dentsply ) for supplying 
 materials and paulo csar freitas santos filho for his assistance at the federal

 resin restorations.objectives the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of light - curing units , curing 
 mode techniques and storage media on sorption , solubility and biaxial flexural 
 strength ( bfs ) of a composite resin . 
 material and methods two hundred and forty specimens were made of one composite resin ( esthet - x ) in a 
 stainless steel mold ( 2 mm x 8 mm  ) , and divided into 24 groups ( n=10 ) 
 established according to the 4 study factors : light - curing units : quartz tungsten 
 halogen ( qth ) lamp and light - emitting diodes ( led ) ; energy densities : 16 
 j / cm2 and 20 j / cm2 ; curing modes : conventional ( cm ) and 
 pulse - delay ( pd ) ; and permeants : deionized water and 75% ethanol for 28 days . 
 sorption and solubility tests were performed according to iso 4049:2000 
 specifications . 
 all specimens were then tested for bfs according to astm f394 - 78 
 specification . 
 data were analyzed by three - way anova followed by tukey , 
 kruskal - wallis and mann - whitney tests ( =0.05 ) . 
 results in general , no significant differences were found regarding sorption , solubility 
 or bfs means for the light - curing units and curing modes ( p>0.05 ) . only led 
 unit using 16 j / cm2 and pd using 10 s produced higher sorption and 
 solubility values than qth . 
 otherwise , using cm ( 16 j / cm2 ) , led 
 produced lower values of bfs than qth ( p<0.05 ) . 
 75% ethanol permeant produced 
 higher values of sorption and solubility and lower values of bfs than water 
 ( p<0.05 ) . 
 conclusion ethanol storage media produced more damage on composite resin than water . in 
 general the led and qth curing units using 16 and 20 j / cm2 by cm and pd 
 curing modes produced no influence on the sorption , solubility or bfs of the 
 tested resin .",474
"carbapenem resistant gram - negative bacteria ( gnb ) such as enterobacteriaceae ( cre ) ( including escherichia coli [ crec ] and klebsiella pneumoniae [ crkp ] ) , pseudomonas aeruginosa ( crpa ) and acinetobacter baumanni ( crab ) are important emerging causes of nosocomial blood stream infections and carry significant mortality . urgent threat  by the us centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , while the antimicrobial availability task force formed by the infectious diseases society of america had identified crpa and crab of particular importance , because of growing antimicrobial resistance among these isolates and shrinking therapeutic options . indian single center studies overall report a prevalence of carbapenem resistance in up to 12 - 15% of enterobacteriaceae and 40 - 60% in a. baumanii and p. aeruginosa . however , there is little data from india about the clinical profile and treatment outcome of infections caused by these organisms . this was a retrospective study performed at a 600 bed tertiary care facility in chennai , india between may 2011 and may 2012 . we identified all blood culture results that had yielded a growth of carbapenem - resistant gnb during the study period . blood cultures were performed using bact / alert ( biomerieux ) culture system , and species ' identification was carried out with vitek - gni card ( biomerieux ) . antibiotic susceptibility was performed using disc diffusion interpretive criteria as per revised clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards . gram - negative bacteremia was defined as the isolation of gram - negative bacilli in blood culture specimen in at least two bottles of two different culture sets with clinical features compatible with systemic inflammatory response syndrome . clinical parameters analyzed included severity of illness as calculated by acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ( apache ) ii score on the day of bacteremia onset , presumed source of infection and presence of arterial and venous central catheters or hemodialysis catheters . the source of bacteremia was defined on the basis clinical and microbiologic evaluation using infections criteria proposed by cdc . presence of risk factors such diabetes , recent surgery , organ transplant and immunosuppression were recorded . prior antibiotic usage , dose of colistin and requirement for renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) after treatment with colistin commenced were also noted . the records of 50 patients with bacteremia caused by crec , crkp , crab , crpa were identified and analyzed . the mean age of patients was 52.3 years and 32 ( 64% ) were male . the most common co - morbid condition was diabetes mellitus ( 30% ) , followed by chronic kidney disease ( 22% ) . the total mean duration of hospitalization was 24.68 days with a mean of 11.76 days of intensive care unit ( icu ) care . the mean time to onset of bacteremia was 6.4 days after admission . of the 50 patients , 96% had already received antibiotics , including beta - lactam / beta - lactamase inhibitors ( 32% ) and carbapenems ( 40% ) [ table 1 ] . the mean (  standard deviation [ sd ] ) apache ii score at the onset of bacteremia was 19.64  3.8 . thirty - eight percent ( n = 19 ) patients had septic shock complicating bacteremia . fourteen episodes ( 28% ) of bacteremia were attributed to ventilator - associated pneumonia ( vap ) , 12 episodes ( 24% ) to the central line related bloodstream infections ( clabsi ) , 10 episodes ( 20% ) were due to intra - abdominal infections ( iai ) and 9 episodes ( 18% ) to urinary tract infections . the most common causative organism in our study was crkp ( 44% ) followed by crec ( 26% ) , while crab and crpa were isolated in 20% and 10% patients respectively [ table 2 ] . observed outcome of patients all patients received a loading dose of colistin with a mean of 5.14 million units intravenously followed by a mean 5.18 million units total daily dose . mean creatinine clearance ( calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate [ egfr ] ) at the initiation of colistin was 52.48 ml / min . six patients ( 12% ) required rrt after initiation of colistin for worsening renal functions ; all recovered to normal renal function . the overall survival at 30 days was 40% in our study with lowest survival rates for clabsi ( 33.3% ) , with survival rates for vap , iai and urosepsis patients of 35.7% , 40% and 44.4% respectively . overall 30 days survival for crab and crkp bacteraemia were lowest ( 30% and 31.8% respectively ) , while survival rates for crpa and crec bacteraemia were 40% and 61.5% respectively . we also found that patients treated with combination therapy had lower mortality ( 44.8% ) compared with colistin monotherapy ( 66.6% ) although this was statistically not significant ( p = 0.35 ) [ table 3 ] . carbapenem resistance in gram - negative organisms is increasingly encountered in healthcare - associated infections in india . bacteremic episodes due to these organisms carry a high mortality as shown by previous studies from other countries . in our study , the most common carbapenem resistant gram - negative isolate was crkp ( 44% ) followed by crec ( 26% ) with more than half of all episodes due to pneumonia or clabsi , similar to two previous indian studies presented as abstracts in scientific meetings . our patients had a high apache ii score ( 19.64  3.8 sd ) and had a mean icu stay of 11.76 days , with a mean time of onset of bacteremia after admission of 6.4 days . these results are in concordance with previous studies implicating these organisms as causes of healthcare - associated infections . seriously ill - patients in icus for prolonged periods often require central lines , dialysis catheters , broad spectrum antibiotics , and mechanical ventilation , which make them susceptible to resistant hospital - acquired infections . notably only 40% of our patients had received carbapenems , but virtually all had antibiotic exposure , suggesting that healthcare exposure and overall prior antibiotic exposure may be more important risk factors for developing carbapenem resistant infections rather than prior receipt of carbapenems . colistin has emerged as the cornerstone of therapy for carbapenem - resistant gnb , but the correct dose and frequency of dosing is a subject of on - going study . the mean colistin loading dose in our study was only 5.14 million units followed by mean total daily dose of 5.18 million units intravenously , even with a mean egfr of 52.48 ml / min at colistin initiation . use of low colistin doses may be because of a perceived concern about nephrotoxicity ; our study period was also prior to evolution of new colistin dosing recommendations . in our study , six patients ( 12% ) required new onset rrt due to worsening renal functions after colistin initiation but this was fully reversible with dosing adjustments , which was reassuring and similar to other studies . the overall 30 days survival rate in our cohort was only 40% , but it was difficult to assess whether this was due to sepsis itself or due to underlying severe illness and multiple co - morbidities . mortality in our patients was highest when clabsi or vap was the source of bacteremia and when crab and crkp were the causative organisms . better survival rates from the west have been reported , but similar results to ours have been observed in two previous indian abstract presentations . higher colistin doses are associated with higher microbiologic clearance and reduced mortality at 7 days although 28 days mortality did not differ . it is also possible that relatively low dose our patients received may have contributed to mortality . we also observed that patients treated with two drug combinations had a trend towards a higher survival rate than those treated with colistin monotherapy , as observed in other studies also . small study numbers in the two groups and the fact that more severely ill patients may receive combination treatment , may have resulted in the absence of a statistically significant difference . we acknowledge significant limitations in our study : its retrospective nature , relatively small sample size and absence of a control group for comparison . we have shown that carbapenem - resistant gram - negative bacteremia is a serious healthcare - associated infection in critically ill - patients in indian icus with co - morbidities and prior antibiotic exposure ; k. pneumoniae is the most common organism at our center . thirty days survival rate is only 40% and even lower for clabsi or vap or when due to a. baumanii or k. pneumoniae . colistin is the cornerstone of therapy and may need to be studied at higher doses to optimize the outcome ; nephrotoxicity requiring rrt was seen in 12% of patients only and was reversible in all . combinations of other antibiotics with colistin may result in a lower mortality compared with monothrapy , however this needs needs to be explored through a randomized controlled study","background : growing antimicrobial resistance and limited therapeutic options to treat carbapenem - resistant bacteremia prompted us to evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with healthcare - associated bacteremia.methods:this was a retrospective observational study of carbapenem - resistant gram - negative bacteremia performed at a tertiary care facility in chennai , india between may 2011 and may 2012.results:in our study , patients had mean 11.76 days of intensive care unit ( icu ) care and mean time to onset of bacteremia was 6.4 days after admission . 
 the commonest organism was klebsiella pneumoniae ( 44% ) . 
 patients with combination treatment had lower mortality ( 44.8% ) compared with colistin monotherapy ( 66.6% ) ; ( p = 0.35).conclusion : carbapenem resistant bacteremia is a late onset infection in patients with antibiotic exposure in the icu and carries a 30 days mortality of 60% ; k. pneumoniae is the most common organism at our center . 
 two drug combinations appear to carry a lower mortality compared with monotherapy .",229

"maintenance of blood glucose levels as close as possible to the nondiabetic range over time is an important goal in the current management of patients with diabetes . assessment of a patient 's diabetes management can be accomplished by directly analyzing the pattern of multiple blood glucose samples drawn over time . however , a high degree of cooperation is required on the part of the patient to collect a sufficient number of blood glucose samples that adequately represent typical diurnal glucose patterns . once collected , statistical analysis is then necessary to assess the central tendency and variability of glucose levels . as an alternative , a patient 's hba1c level can be easily and conveniently determined from a single blood sample . a large number of studies have shown that hba1c is strongly associated with the preceding mean plasma glucose ( mpg ) over previous weeks and months [ 25 ] . based on the statistical relation of hba1c and mpg , hba1c is widely used as a clinical estimation of mpg , and it has been proposed as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes , as well . hba1c has , therefore , become a standard assessment of glycemia   and a standard part of diabetes management . one of the most important limitations of hba1c is that it is not applicable in short intervals . erythrocyte life span in normal conditions averages ~120 days , and the glycation of hemoglobin ( hb ) is a continuous , nonenzymatic , relatively slow and nearly irreversible process   that means change in effects of previous glycation on hb takes several weeks to months to occur . to permit a much clearer assessing of diabetes management , it is generally recommended that the hba1c assay be used every 2 - 3 months . ideally , if measured each 120 days ( 4 months ) it gives a precise estimation of mpg over preceding 4 months , reliably comparable to previous hba1c value . if measurement is taken earlier than erythrocyte life span intervals ( 4 months ) , because of existing previously glycated hbs which have not reached end of their lives , the estimated mpg would be affected by previous plasma glucose levels . this would be an important issue , and if measured following a significant variations in plasma glucose during changes in patient 's diabetes control or medication , then it would end to a remarkable error in estimation of mpg . i devised an innovative mathematical model to describe novel equations governing hba1c which enables analysis of hba1c behavior and provides emerging new concepts in assessment of diabetes management . quarterly hba1c and corresponding seven - point capillary blood glucose profiles obtained in the dcct have been analyzed to define the relationship between hba1c and mpg . hba1c is linearly related to mpg based on linear regression analysis weighted by the number of observations per subject ( figure 1 ) , producing a relationship of 
						 ( 1)mpg(mg / dl)=35.6hba1c77.3 . 
					 or 
						 ( 2)hba1c=135.6mpg+2.17 . mpg at increasing levels of hba1c is shown in table 1 based on dcct data correlating hba1c with mpg using 7-point blood glucose profiles along with adag data using continuous glucose monitoring systems [ 5 , 9 ] . the kinetic analysis of hba1c formation depicted in figure 2 shows the linear relationship between hba1c formation rate and time , with the slope proportional to the mpg . the higher the blood glucose is , the faster hba1c will be formed , resulting in higher hba1c levels . for instance , it is elicited from the curve mpg = 137 , that the hba1c rate in newly born rbcs is 0% , and in rbcs with 60 and 120 days old , 6 and 12% , respectively . it can be corroborated that the mean hba1c in a collection of erythrocytes with different ages and hba1c rates is the median point or arithmetic mean of the upper and lower limits of the curve . erythrocyte life span in normal conditions is about 120 days and the level of hba1c at any point in time is contributed to by all circulating erythrocytes , from the oldest ( 120 days old ) to the youngest . since the rate of rbc formation is equal to its degradation , the percentage of rbc count in a single day is 1/120 of total rbc mass . hence , 1/120 of rbc collection are one day old , 1/120 are two days old , and likewise 1/120 are 120 days old . the mean value of hba1c in a collection of rbcs with different ages can be calculated by averaging of hba1c rate in each rbc as follows : 
						 ( 3)mean  hba1c=1120n(1/120)rbcmassrbcmass , 
					 where n is hba1c rate in rbcs with n days old and rbc mass is total number of rbcs in the body . since glycation of hb according to figure 2 follows a linear pattern , it is expected that 
						 ( 4)2=21 ,  3=31 ,  ,  120=1201 . 
					 hence , 
						 ( 5)hba1c=(1/120)rbcmass(1+120)(120/2)rbcmass=(1+120)2 . 
					 accordingly , the mean value of hba1c in a collection of rbcs would be the arithmetic mean of upper and lower limits of the curve . the mathematical relationship between data leading to the curves depicted in figure 2 can be correlated by the following formula : 
						 ( 6)hba1c = mpg/35.6 + 2.172 m , 
					 where mpg contributes the mean plasma glucose in which hb glycation is progressing and m is the variation of time in month . we will now map this model into mathematical expressions and start with an example . example 1assume that you have visited a diabetic patient with hba1c = 9% and mpg = 244  mg / dl and after adjusting the medications , patient 's mpg has fallen to the curve mpg = 137 as visualized by graphic presentation in figure 3 . after one month you are interested in calculating the hba1c which is the mixture of previously and newly glycated hbs and is estimated to be in range of 6% to 9%.as described in figure 3 , after passing one month of changes in mpg , the erythrocytes with 3 to 4 months old will reach the end of their lives and destroy themselves . this upper extreme can be calculated as 
							 ( 7)upper = mpg1/35.6 + 2.172(4m)=hb12(4m)=13.5% . as described before ( by ( 5 ) ) the mean value of hba1c in this group of rbcs is arithmetic mean of upper and lower extremes of the curve , that is 
							 ( 8)mean=upper2=mpg1/35.6 + 2.174(4m)=hb14(4m)=6.75% . 
						 over the past one month , these previously glycated rbcs undergo new glycation on the curve mpg = 137 to convey the prior mean hba1c to a newly higher point . this displacement of mean hba1c point on the second curve over m months can be written as 
							 ( 9)mean = mpgx/35.6 + 2.172m = hbx2m=3% . the sum of contributions ( 8) and ( 9 ) represents the cumulative mean hba1c in this group of rbcs with former and later glycation on two different curves . ( 10)1=mpg1/35.6 + 2.174(4m)+mpgx/35.6 + 2.172m = hb14(4m)+hbx2m=9.75% . 
						 furthermore , during the past one month , second group of rbcs have been newly formed and undergone glycation on the new curve ( mpg = 137 ) with mean hba1c of 
							 ( 11)2=mpgx/35.6 + 2.174m = hbx4m=1.5% . 
						 following all above steps , we can find the final desired hba1c by averaging equations 1 and 2 considering their coefficients according to available rbcs in each group ( 3  :  1 , three months versus one month ) .

						 to make the presented 3-variable equation more applicable , it can be used at definite points of time with different values of mpg1 and laboratory measured hbmix . as an instance , error estimation of measured hba1c for detection of patient 's mean plasma glucose in 2 and 3 months intervals is expressed in tables 3 and 4 according to different values of mpg1 and hbmix.as presented in tables 3 and 4 , estimated error emerged in different values of mpg1 and hbmix ranges from 50% to + 20% for 2-month interval and 26% to + 5% for 3-month interval . negative and positive errors contribute to overestimation and underestimation of patient 's mpg , respectively . the higher the difference between hb1 and hbmix is , the bigger the error emerged from crude estimation of patient 's mpg via laboratory measured hbmix . assume a diabetic patient with hb1 = 12% and mpg1 = 350 to whom changing in therapeutic regimens is applied . after two weeks , the rechecked hba1c is hbmix = 11% . according to ( 16 ) , the mean plasma glucose in recent two weeks can be calculated as

						 and is presented in table 2 . the calculated changes of hba1c over time derived from devised mathematical model are in full quantitative agreement with previous clinical studies [ 1113 ] showing that plasma glucose levels in the preceding 30 days contribute ~50% to the final results , and pg levels from 90120 days earlier contribute only ~10% . as briefly described , without applying the presented equations , early measurement of hba1c will end to a crude and erroneous estimation of patient 's mpg . how frequently should it be checked is a great controversy among authorities , but the general trend and recommendation vary from 2 to 3 months . additional application of our mathematical model is calculation of emerged error at any desired time intervals , defined as deviation of the crude estimation of mpg derived via hbmix , from real mpg calculated by devised equations

							 ( 21)error=1(35.6hbmix77.3)(570hbmixmpg1(m28m+16)1236(8mm2))100 . to make the presented 3-variable equation more applicable , it can be used at definite points of time with different values of mpg1 and laboratory measured hbmix . as an instance , error estimation of measured hba1c for detection of patient 's mean plasma glucose in 2 and 3 months intervals is expressed in tables 3 and 4 according to different values of mpg1 and hbmix . as presented in tables 3 and 4 , estimated error emerged in different values of mpg1 and hbmix ranges from 50% to + 20% for 2-month interval and 26% to + 5% for 3-month interval . negative and positive errors contribute to overestimation and underestimation of patient 's mpg , respectively . the higher the difference between hb1 and hbmix is , the bigger the error emerged from crude estimation of patient 's mpg via laboratory measured hbmix . hemoglobin is continuously glycated during the 120-day life span of erythrocyte such that the cumulative amount of hba1c in an erythrocyte is directly proportional to the time - averaged concentration of glucose within the erythrocyte [ 8 , 10 , 14 , 15 ] . glycated hemoglobins provide an index of the patient 's average blood glucose concentration over a long time period . this index is not affected by short - term fluctuations in blood sugar ( hour to hour ) and hence gives a relatively precise reflection of the state of blood glucose control in diabetes . to introduce novel applications and new concepts about hba1c , an innovative mathematical simulation was analytically modeled to describe the hba1c behavior and process of events . the basic suppositions are cited from available equations expressed in figures 1 and 2 [ 9 , 10 ] . the devised model is used to predict the mean plasma glucose at any desired point in time with great certainty . by using derived formulas , it does not take 120 days to detect a clinically meaningful and reliable value for hba1c and mpg over preceding months . in addition to the presented application , i specifically was interested in assessing the pattern of hba1c changes over time and calculation of emerged error during crude estimation of mpg from hbmix . as described in table 2 and figure 4 , change in hba1c shows a prompt fall upon institution of rigorous diabetic control . this finding can be readily explained by decay of older erythrocytes with highest rates of glycated hb , as demonstrated in figure 3 . this model refutes the explanation that recent pg levels ( i.e. , 3 - 4 weeks earlier ) contribute considerably more to the level of hba1c than do long past pg levels ( i.e. , 3 - 4 months earlier ) [ 1113 ] . according to calculated error for 2- and 3-month interval and its explained logic , without employment of the devised model , hba1c should be used with caution as a surrogate measure of mpg because it may significantly under or overestimate patient 's mpg . the tests currently in use for diagnosis are the fasting plasma glucose test and the less common oral glucose tolerance test . however , these tests can be inaccurate if a person has eaten recently or is sick . advantages of the hba1c test are that it can be given at any time and , because it reflects blood glucose levels over a longer period , it is not unduly influenced by events on the day of the test . this devised model also makes hba1c more befitting and useful for being a main part of guidelines on using the hba1c test as a diagnostic tool for diabetes . however , a consensus statement is necessary because right now there is no agreement on what hba1c level would constitute a diagnosis of diabetes .","hba1c is a standard clinical assessment of glycemia and the basis of most data relating glycemic control to complications . while daily blood glucose testing gives a picture of day - to - day fluctuations , the hba1c test offers an overview of how well glucose has been controlled over the past 4 months . 
 i devised an innovative mathematical model to describe novel equations governing hba1c which enables analysis of hba1c behavior and provides emerging new concepts in assessment of diabetes management . 
 linear relationship of hba1c and mean plasma glucose along with the kinetic analysis of hba1c formation has been used as the basic suppositions to construct this model . 
 the main application of this devised model is prediction of mean plasma glucose at any desired point in time after a change in therapy and with great certainty . 
 this model also appraises the pattern of hba1c changes over time and provides a unique opportunity to address common mistakes and misconceptions in routine application of hba1c that could have potentially important implications on diabetes control .",211
"seizures are the most common neurological events of childhood with approximately 35% of children experiencing a seizure at some point in their lives 25% of whom subsequently go on to develop epilepsy . the prevalence of epilepsy in india is 4.9 to 6.2 per 1000 population . of these patients with epilepsy , 43% comprises of children and adolescents .  intractable epilepsy  is defined as a failure to respond to at least two antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) given over at least a two - year period . a single definition for  intractable epilepsy can not suit all situations as definitions of intractability are individualized to the patient . of these patients deemed to be intractable , approximately 50% are estimated to have surgically remediable epilepsy [ 4 , 5 ] . hemispheric epilepsy  ( he ) refers to epileptiform activity in all four lobes of one hemisphere , and when it involves more than two lobes of the brain , it is termed  subhemispheric epilepsy  ( she ) [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] . these hemispheric brain lesions are commonly associated with early onset of catastrophic epilepsies and multiple seizure types that inhibit brain development . these respond well to early hemispheric / subhemispheric disconnective / resective surgeries [ 69 ] . an analysis was done of the pre- and postsurgical data of 34 children who underwent disconnective epilepsy surgeries , that is , a peri - insular hemispherotomy ( pih ) or a peri - insular posterior quadrantectomy ( pipq ) for hemispheric / subhemispheric epilepsy from april 2000 to march 2011 . the hemisphere contralateral to the hemiparesis was shown by radiological ( mri / computerised tomography ( ct ) ) and functional ( scalp eeg / eeg video telemetry ) imaging to have a unilateral diffuse abnormality and the remaining hemisphere was normal . when the epileptogenic zone encompassed large areas of the temporal , parietal and occipital lobes with sparing of the frontal lobe the decision was dependant on good concordance between the imaging ( mri , ct , nuclear studies ) , eeg , clinical and neuropsychological evaluations , and a clear localization of the lesion to the unilateral - affected region . the indications for pipq were the same as for hemispheric epilepsy , the pathology being localized to involve the temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . the presence of residual voluntary motor function of the contralateral distal musculature , that is , finger opposition and foot tapping , was the indication for pipq preserving eloquent uninvolved sensorimotor cortex . all patients went through a presurgical evaluation including a study of the seizure semiology , neurological examination , multiple electroencephalogram ( eeg ) examinations ( video telemetry ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , and neuropsychological evaluation . the focus of the evaluation was to identify a surgically remediable epilepsy syndrome with good electro - clinico - radiological concordance . if the structural lesion responsible for epilepsy could be safely removed without causing deterioration in the functional status , the patient was considered for epilepsy surgery . however , if there was no concordance in investigations in the phase i evaluation , the patient would enter a phase ii evaluation which would include prolonged invasive eeg monitoring , nuclear medicine studies ( positron emission tomography ( pet ) and single photon emission computerized tomography ( spect ) ) , and a wada ( sodium amylobarbital ) test . however , none of our patients required a phase ii evaluation . ( figure 1 ) this is a surgical method of functional hemispherectomy that enables disconnection of the hemisphere through peri - insular windows requiring limited removal of the fronto - parieto - temporal opercular cortices . following the surgical principles of  anatomical subtotal removal of the hemisphere and complete disconnection , the pih is a radical hemispheric tractotomy based on the concept of maximum disconnection with minimal excision . it resulted from the demonstration that the hemisphere could be disconnected , made nonfunctional , through very small removal of brain tissue [ 9 , 14 , 15 ] . a pipq was performed in all cases of subhemispheric epilepsy and the surgery tailored to encompass the whole epileptogenic lesion yet preserving the central region , which is still functional . ( figure 2 ) in this technical variant , there is a minimal removal of brain tissue but complete disconnection of the remaining major part of the abnormal cortex , which is left anatomically intact and viable by preservation of the arteries and veins irrigating these lobes . the primary motor and sensory cortices are identified and recognized from the study of the mri and correlation with intraoperative surface anatomy , based on gyral pattern , arteries , and veins [ 6 , 7 ] . the identification of the functional cortex is also aided by electrophysiological means under general anaesthesia before the disconnection . this identification maximizes both the extent of resection and the safety of surgery [ 6 , 7 ] . in this variant , the mesial temporal structures are resected , but the temporal neocortex is disconnected and not resected followed by a parieto - occipital disconnection [ 6 , 7 ] . the data was analyzed with nonparametric tests because of the small sample size among the children with poor outcome following surgery ( engel 's class ii nonparametric  square test and mann - whitney u test was were to compare the categorical and continuous variables between the groups . p < 0.05 ( two tailed ) was considered significant and data was analyzed using spss ( version 19 ) . the mean age of seizure onset was 3.8 years ( range : from neonates to 12 years ) . the mean duration of epilepsy was 4 years ( range : from 3 months to 14 years ) . 28 children ( 82.3% ) had a seizure frequency of 2 episodes / day , while 11 ( 32.3% ) had at least one episode of status epilepticus prior to surgery . epilepsy was due to rasmussen 's encephalitis ( re ; n = 11 ) ( figure 3 ) , infantile hemiplegia seizure syndrome ( ihss ; n = 12 ) ( figure 4 ) , hemimegalencephaly ( hm ; n = 3 ) ( figure 5 ) , sturge weber syndrome ( sws ; n = 4 ) ( figure 6 ) , and postencephalitic sequelae ( pes ; n twenty - seven ( 79.4% ) patients underwent pih for lesions causing hemispheric epilepsy , and seven ( 20.6% ) underwent pipq for lesions causing subhemispheric epilepsy . the seizure outcome after surgery was assessed by engel 's classification   and is described along with followup in table 1 . we recorded 11 variables and analyzed them to arrive at predictive variables of a complete seizure freedom . we found that age of seizure onset ( p = 0.03 ) and the etiology of the disease causing epilepsy ( p = 0.007 ) were predictive variables for the same . patients who had re , sws , pes , and ihss had good seizure outcomes following surgery . the results of our cognitive outcomes that have been published before   show that the mental and social age showed a steady increase after surgery . however , in the long term , intelligence quotient ( iq ) showed only a gradual gain on followup . older age of onset of seizures and a shorter duration of seizures prior to surgery were predictive of positive cognitive gains following surgery . complications in this series included pseudomeningocele in 2 ( 5.8% ) and low pressure hydrocephalus in 1 ( 2.9% ) who required a low pressure ventriculoperitoneal shunt . this is quite low as compared to other published series ( table 4 ) [ 911 ] . we also had 15 patients who developed postoperative fever , but csf cultures were sterile . this could have been due to an aseptic meningitis due to the presence of blood products in the disconnected cavity . our series documents 91.1% seizure freedom , which is similar to other published studies [ 9 , 12 , 1621 ] . following functional hemispherectomy , seizure free outcomes have ranged from 52 to 90% [ 9 , 1621 ] . this range could be explained by differences in patient selection or technical pitfalls such as incomplete removal in anatomical hemispherectomy and incomplete disconnection in functional hemispherotomy [ 14 , 19 ] . we found the age of seizure onset to be a strong predictor of seizure freedom ( table 2 ) . this finding is also supported by other studies [ 3 , 22 , 23 ] . a younger age of seizure onset is usually seen in children with developmental cortical malformations and multifocal epilepsy , which are proven to have poor seizure control . the etiology of the disease producing epilepsy is also a strong predictor of seizure freedom ( table 3 ) . the best results in our series were obtained in children suffering from re , sws , pes , and ihss ( table 3 ) . ihss and sws are seen in the perinatal age group , and they are generally unilateral with complete sparing of the opposite side . there has been evidence to support that in such cases , early surgical intervention facilitates good seizure control and helps the uninvolved hemisphere to develop and take over the functions of both sides . however , in one patient with ihss , we had a class ii seizure outcome and this was in the initial part of the series , which could be attributed to incomplete disconnection , and this patient was lost to follow up . all patients with re had a class i seizure outcome as this disease also strictly affects only one hemisphere . however , the seizure outcome in patients with hm was not satisfactory as described in literature , and this has been reported in other series too [ 9 , 1721 ] . the likely explanation could be the presence of migrational abnormalities in the so - called  preserved hemisphere  or early development of an epileptic encephalopathy , already in utero . we found a significant gain in the mental and social age in the immediate postsurgical period which continued into the second and third years of followup . our study   also showed that older age of onset of seizures showed positive mental and social age gains at followup . onset of intractable epilepsy within the first 24 months of life is a significant risk factor for mental retardation , especially if seizures occur daily [ 12 , 24 ] . most of these children have a low dq / iq to begin with and the improvement in cognitive skills after surgery is poorer in these children . furthermore , our study   also showed that a shorter duration of seizures prior to surgery is predictive of positive mental and social age gains , a finding that is in keeping with those of freitag and tuxhorn   and basheer et al . . in general , children with ie in our country are not exposed adequately to environmental stimuli as schooling is discontinued in the presence of seizures . with good postoperative seizure control , the child 's attention capacities increase and they engage in social interaction with their family and peers . an improved school attendance due to seizure freedom improves their adaptive skills that in turn helps the child improve his performance in activities of daily living . in our experience , over 90% of children with hemispheric and subhemispheric epilepsy syndromes achieve an excellent seizure outcome with less morbidity following epilepsy surgery . age of seizure onset and etiology of the disease causing epilepsy are independent predictive variables of a good seizure outcome . following seizure freedom , improvement of function in the residual brain occurs that in turn leads to improvement in adaptive and social functions and quality of life .","objectives : to study the outcome of disconnective epilepsy surgery for intractable hemispheric and sub - hemispheric pediatric epilepsy . 
 methods : a retrospective analysis of the epilepsy surgery database was done in all children ( age < 18 years ) who underwent a peri - insular hemispherotomy ( pih ) or a peri - insular posterior quadrantectomy ( pipq ) from april 2000 to march 2011 . 
 all patients underwent a detailed pre surgical evaluation . 
 seizure outcome was assessed by the engel 's classification and cognitive skills by appropriate measures of intelligence that were repeated annually . 
 results : there were 34 patients in all . 
 epilepsy was due to rasmussen 's encephalitis ( re ) , infantile hemiplegia seizure syndrome ( ihss ) , hemimegalencephaly ( hm ) , sturge weber syndrome ( sws ) and due to post encephalitic sequelae ( pes ) . 
 twenty seven ( 79.4% ) patients underwent pih and seven ( 20.6% ) underwent pipq . 
 the mean follow up was 30.5 months . at the last follow up , 31 ( 91.1% ) were seizure free . 
 the age of seizure onset and etiology of the disease causing epilepsy were predictors of a class i seizure outcome . 
 conclusions : there is an excellent seizure outcome following disconnective epilepsy surgery for intractable hemispheric and subhemispheric pediatric epilepsy . an older age of seizure onset , re , 
 sws and pes were good predictors of a class i seizure outcome .",329
"to present a unique case of a 58-year - old female with toxic anterior segment syndrome ( tass ) , following a triple procedure : descemet 's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty ( dsaek ) , phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation . the patient was treated with topical dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1% and topical atropine sulfate 1% . due to a slow improvement in her clinical status , oral prednisone 1 mg / kg / day was added . the anterior chamber reaction improved gradually , with tapering down of topical and oral treatment , until a complete resolution of the anterior chamber reaction was observed . taking into account the estimated volume of dsaek triple procedures performed worldwide , we would expect an annual incidence of several tass cases , following triple dsaek procedures . however , we were unable to find any such previous reports in the literature . this fact raises questions regarding the cause of reduced tass incidence following triple dsaek procedures . toxic anterior segment syndrome ( tass ) is an acute , sterile anterior chamber inflammation , which may develop following anterior segment surgery . most cases are reported after uneventful cataract surgery . in patients requiring both cataract extraction and endothelial keratoplasty , a descemet 's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty ( dsaek ) triple procedure , consisting of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens ( iol ) implantation , followed by dsaek , up to the present , only two reports of keratoplasty - related tass have been published , both following penetrating keratoplasty . the first was a case series of 8 patients with tass - like , noninfectious , severe , early inflammation . the second , reported a large outbreak of tass ( 24 cases out of 94 procedures performed ) , presenting as postoperative keratitis with inflammatory anterior chamber reaction  mainly hypopion and cells . this outbreak was found to be caused by faulty sterilization of the guided trephine system . to our knowledge herein is presented a case of tass following a triple procedure : dsaek , phacoemulsification and posterior chamber iol implantation . a 58-year - old female , suffering from bilateral fuchs endothelial dystrophy , bilateral cataract and corneal subepithelial scarring in her left cornea , following an adenovirus infection , underwent an uneventful dsaek triple procedure in her left eye : phacoemulsification , implantation of a posterior chamber iol and dsaek . intraocular pressure was 13 mm hg , best - corrected visual acuity was 20/200 , and the graft was attached to the recipient cornea , with a deep anterior chamber . treatment with topical dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1% and ofloxacin 0.3% administered four times daily was initiated . five days following the surgery , the patient presented with decreased vision in her left eye , which had begun 24 h postoperatively . on examination of her left eye , 1 ) revealed conjunctival hyperemia , a completely attached and centrally located endothelial corneal graft , deep anterior chamber with a cellular reaction of 3 + and prominent flare measuring 3 + . visualization of the posterior segment was poor due to the clinical status of the anterior segment  no details could be observed , but for a red light reflex . the patient was started on hourly topical dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1% . due to the extensive posterior synechiae , the patient received a short and intensive course of topical tropicamide 0.5% and phenylephrine hydrochloride 10% , followed by topical atropine sulfate 1% . follow - up examination , one day after the initiation of treatment , revealed significant improvement in the anterior chamber cellular reaction with no evident cells or flare , and residual posterior synechiae spanning 60 degrees . the posterior segment could be well visualized , showing no inflammatory involvement of the retina and vitreous . fibrin fiber accumulation was only mildly improved and therefore , the patient was started on oral prednisone 1 mg / kg / day . due to the early onset of visual deterioration ( 24 h postoperatively ) , the normal appearing posterior segment ( visualized shortly after initiation of treatment ) and the rapid clinical response to the above treatment , a clinical diagnosis of infectious endophthalmitis was ruled out . follow - up examinations on days 3 , 8 and 10 following initiation of treatment , revealed gradual absorption of fibrin and no evident posterior synechiae . 8 weeks following the tass diagnosis , the patient 's best - corrected visual acuity was 20/50 , with a spherical correction of + 1.25 diopter and a cylindrical correction of 1.75 diopter ( 170 axis ) . intraocular pressure was 14 mm hg , with a clear , attached , thin endothelial corneal graft . no evidence of an anterior chamber reaction , fibrin formation or posterior synechiae was observed . according to the eye bank of america association , 42,606 corneal transplants were performed in the usa in 2009 , out of which 18,221 were endothelial keratoplasty procedures (  2009 eye banking statistical report , washington , dc , eye bank association of america ) . the world health organization ( who ) estimates that about 120,000 corneal transplants are performed worldwide each year (  human organ and tissue transplantation report by the secretariat , submitted at the 112th session of the world health organization executive board , may 2003 ) . there is no sufficient data in the literature regarding the volume of triple dsaek procedure surgeries performed worldwide . the frequency of tass reported in the literature is about 0.250.8% [ 5 , 6 ] . therefore , we would expect an annual incidence of several tass cases , following triple dsaek procedures . it is probable that the cataract extraction constituent of the triple dsaek procedure is responsible for the occurrence of tass in our patient . nevertheless , the fact that there is no previous report of tass following such a procedure raises questions regarding the cause of the reduced incidence of tass following triple dsaek procedures . due to the fact that the inflammatory reaction may jeopardize the integrity of the endothelial graft and reduce the chances of a successful transplant , we intend to closely monitor this patient and apply a more gradual tapering down of her current treatment .","purposeto present a unique case of a 58-year -

"the effect of family on workforce is an important though often overlooked issue for work organizations , with implications for the morale , stability and productivity of the workforce . presumably men and women do not shed their family roles , relationships and experiences the moment they don their work clothes . indeed , the logic underlying many corporations ' decisions to offer employer - based family support , such as child care and flexible working schedules , may be that such benefits will enhance employees ' abilities to handle family matters and in so doing will enhance their work performance , commitment and satisfaction . this line of reasoning views the relationship between work and family as a reciprocal process in which work and family influence each other in a circular or feedback fashion . indian families are undergoing change , which in turn influences the environment in the basic unit . the family environment has been bombarded with new expectations , the media , high cost of living and a striving for better quality of life . although not much literature is available on the aspect of how family stress has influenced the productivity of the indian workforce , the author is of the opinion that absenteeism , alcoholism , gambling , heavy debts among employees are a reflection of bruised familial systems . the dual - earning couple is a new prototype that reflects the increasing educational and career aspirations of women . a significant proportion of these women in the workforce comprises of wives and mothers whose employment status demands a radical change in their pattern , activities , commitments and responsibilities , requiring a reassessment of the family environment . in india the proportion of women in the workforce in 1981 was 19.67% and it rose to 22.73% in 1991 , further rising to 25.68% in 2001 . on the flipside , psychosocial studies have shown that dual - earning couples in india have a poorer quality of marital life compared to single - earning couples,[46 ] in their study found that work - family conflict was expressed in 63% of thematic appreciation test ( tat ) stories written by women , whereas men 's stories did not reflect this conflict . sources of stress in the lives of working women emerged from a lack of time to attend to multiple roles , presence of young children ( 6 - 12 years ) in the family and additional responsibility at work in the form of promotions . the most common outcome of stress for the working woman was found to be poor mental and physical health resulting in depression , anxiety , asthma and colitis.[911 ] rajadhyaksha[79 ] studied dual - career as opposed to dual - earning couples in two metropolitan cities in india and found that in a dual - career family where husbands and wives were presumably matched in terms of their career involvement , work - family role conflict and organizational role stress were not significantly different among husbands and wives . for instance , women experienced more conflict between their job and home roles , while men experienced more conflict between their job and spousal roles . in the present day , the young indian adult is exposed to an entirely new pattern of living and a new set of mores , values and standards that are being widely accepted but which stand in contrast to those which were promoted by their parents and grandparents . the ambiguous values children and adolescents observe today in india , coupled with the increasing gap between aspirations and possible achievement , have led to a greater sense of ' alienation . ' parents too appear ill - prepared to cope with rapid social change , having grown up in hierarchically structured and interdependent social groups that included the extended family and kinship network , as well as caste groups that provided stability and solidarity . parents who seem modern in their child - rearing practices get anxious when their offspring breach established social codes . inter - generation conflicts related to marriage , career choice or separate living arrangements result in the tendency to fall back on tradition . subtle changes in family patterns , especially with regard to the use of authority within the family , as well as an increased focus on individual autonomy,[1617 ] are also likely to influence members ' expectations with regard to marriage and their choice of a spouse . educated middle class families are now more hesitant to make decisions for their offspring with regard to marriage , education and employment . changes have also been noticed with regard to a greater focus on the husband - wife relationship rather than the parent - child relationship . with an increased onus of responsibility falling on the individual rather than on the entire family , gore calls ' choice anxiety' increased autonomy and increased choice that have led to increased anxiety . ambiguity with regard to issues like respect for elders , role of the eldest son , love marriages , working wives , etc . , is an inevitable fallout of the changes within the indian family . relationship - focused education for young adults in the workforce has not been on top of the agenda for india 's policy makers . india 's policies on family and child welfare have been focused more in terms of health care , nutrition , reproductive health , sexuality and venereal disease . however , one can not forget that young adults of marriageable age from ' first - generation urban - educated families ' are facing relationship - based problems due to changing dynamics within the indian family . these include shifts in loyalty from filial obligations to lean more towards conjugal ties and issues of power and gender role allocations . marriage is traditionally seen as means for procreation , but there are slow changes in perception among adolescents towards viewing it as a means of companionship . with couples migrating to cities for better job prospects , there is a decreased availability of the informal support provided by the extended family in the past , resulting in young couples having to develop greater problem - solving and coping skills on their own . this in turn weighs heavily on an employee 's ability to focus completely on tasks at work . it is essential to bridge the gap between what their families of origin considered as an ideal or happy marriage and what they now desire from a spouse and family life . the author conducted individual interviews with family - intervention experts in bangalore city in order to better understand the changing family patterns that they were observing . among the professionals , there were two clinical psychologists , two psychiatric social workers , two psychiatrists and one divorce lawyer . the key person interview ( kpi ) cue statements to initiate discussions with the experts were as follows [ table 1 ] : description of key person interview participants 
 changes that you are seeing in the nature of problems that families are coming to you with in comparison to the nature of problems brought up a decade agoname some culture - specific areas that need to be kept in mind while preparing the family life education programsome areas that you feel need to be essentially covered by a family life education program for single young adults . changes that you are seeing in the nature of problems that families are coming to you with in comparison to the nature of problems brought up a decade ago name some culture - specific areas that need to be kept in mind while preparing the family life education program some areas that you feel need to be essentially covered by a family life education program for single young adults . it is interesting to note that among the changes noticed by family experts in relation to the aspect of family issues , is the ability to recognize issues early on in the marriage and to seek help for the same . another important change noticed by the experts was that a larger number of young couples who were either engaged or in a relationship were now seeking professional help in order to help them make the right choice of a partner or to resolve issues that they were afraid would snowball into a larger issue post - marriage . an interesting perspective put forward by the legal expert in family law was that he was seeing an increasing number of divorces that were occurring as early as the third or sixth month of marriage , with both partners willing to go in for a divorce by mutual consent . this , he said , was in stark contrast to what he encountered some 10 years ago , when most couples would go through a long - drawn - out battle with much mud - slinging or would want to keep trying to make things work . the recognition of sexual dissatisfaction by , and the unwillingness to stay in a marriage on the part of , the female spouse was also another prominent change that experts were noticing . a long - distance relationship , with spouses staying in different cities and meeting on the weekends , was also another trend that was being noticed . themes from key person interview with family experts leadership and decision - making issues in the joint family largely arose due to the inability to face up to , or communicate with , authority figures within the family , thus leading to frustration and passive aggression . talking about one 's sexual needs was another cultural peculiarity that often created rifts within couples or forced couples to try and work things out . it is also interesting to note that the family experts were able to clearly point out the need for any family life education program to be sensitive to indian culture in terms of how it viewed the role of the joint family . experts also pointed out the program had to be careful about how it portrayed communication within the family and had to keep in mind the factor of ' respect ' that indian families often prescribe to . the third column clearly gives the areas that these family experts felt a family life education program should cover . the experts felt that adaptability was an important skill that the new indian spouse was quickly losing . gender sensitivity in terms of acceptance of changing work and family roles of the female spouse by the male spouse was another important area that the experts talked about . discussions with these family - intervention experts brought out the following areas as possible aspects to be included in family life education program for the younger - generation workforce : 
 gender sensitivityparenting skillsconflict resolution skillsadaptability to changebalancing work and the familycommunication skillssocialization and social supportmoney managementchoosing a life partnersexuality and intimacydealing with violence and addiction 
  conflict resolution skills adaptability to change balancing work and the family socialization and social support choosing a life partner sexuality and intimacy dealing with violence and addiction the experts definitely seemed to sense the need for some form of education or training for the young indian adult who is either contemplating family life or is a new entrant into marriage or parenthood . family issues that eat into employees ' ability to perform or affect his cognitive and emotional state of being need to be addressed . a promotive and preventive strategy rather than a curative one would have to be adopted for this purpose . relationship - focused family life education programs for the target group of employees at the workplace may actually serve to fulfill this purpose , whereby employees , through group interaction and experiential learning , can be taught skills to deftly handle family - life conflicts either by themselves or through the support of mental health professionals . thus a mental health professional need not be there merely to diffuse a difficult situation arising out of deviance of an employee . he or she may act as a preventive agent of avoiding such deviance from arising , by tackling the problem at the root by pre - equipping the family with the necessary psychoeducation and skills .","the article presents the premises for the need to develop a relationship - focused family life education program for young adult employees . 
 the article explores the changing trends in the indian family unit and their impact on the workforce .

"from 2000 through 2005 , the french national reference centre for salmonella at the institut pasteur in paris reported 829 newport isolates among 69,759 salmonella clinical isolates . during this period and depending on the year , serotype newport ranked between 6th and 10th in prevalence among human serotyped isolates . from 2000 through 2005 , the agence franaise de scurit sanitaire des aliments reported 2,160 newport isolates among 101,791 salmonella isolates collected from animals and food products . antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing was performed on 585 human newport isolates and 342 nonhuman newport isolates by disk diffusion with 32 antimicrobial drugs ( additional information available from fxweill@pasteur.fr ) . of 585 isolates tested , 46 ( 7.9% ) were resistant to third - generation cepalosporins . the geographic origin of the isolates was mainly the paris metropolitan area and northern france ( appendix table ) . resistant isolates during 2000 ( 15% ) and 2003 ( 17.5% caused by a small outbreak ) . no third - generation cephalosporin resistance was detected in any of the nonhuman newport isolates tested . * studied ; n , no . of isolates received at the french national reference centre for salmonella ( 1 per patient ) . all but 1 of the newport isolates were resistant to cefoxitin ( appendix table ) . these isolates showed 4 resistance phenotypes ; most ( 41 , 89.1% ) were resistant to streptomycin , sulfonamides , chloramphenicol , and tetracycline . pcr and sequencing showed that the 45 isolates resistant to cefoxitin were positive for the blacmy-2 gene , and cefoxitin - susceptible isolates contained the extended - spectrum -lactamase gene blactx - m-1 . mg / l to > 256 mg / l , and ceftazidime mics ranged from 64 three isolates with additional resistance to aminoglycosides contained a class 1 integron with the 1-kb gene cassette aada24 ( known to encode resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin ) ( 11 ) . the chloramphenicol / florfenicol resistance gene flor was detected in all but 1 cmy-2producing newport isolate . clonal relatedness of newport isolates was assessed by multilocus sequence typing ( mlst ) and pulsenet standard method pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) ( figure 1 ) . all 16 newport mdr - ampc isolates tested had a common sequence type ( st ) , st45 . xbai - pfge identified 10 distinct profiles ( similarity 76.7% ) among all 45 newport mdr - ampc isolates . single enzyme matches were found for 3 of the profiles ( 15 isolates ) in the us pulsenet national database ( www.cdc.gov/pulsenet ; appendix table ; figure 2 ) . two pfge types ( new6 and new8 ) were divided into 24 subtypes because of additional band(s ) < 100 kb . isolates from the 2003 outbreak showed 4 similar but distinct pfge profiles that differed by 12 bands , migrated between 60 and 100 kb , and were attributed to plasmid(s ) ( additional information available from fxweill@pasteur.fr ) . if only cases with indistinguishable pfge profiles had been tested , potentially related cases would not have been linked to this outbreak . therefore , during an outbreak investigation of newport mdr - ampc , analysis of plasmid content ( either by alkaline lysis or s1 nuclease , depending on size of additional bands ) might complete xbai - pfge profiles for isolates whose profiles differ by 1 or 2 additional bands of low molecular mass . representative xbai pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) profiles of third - generation cephalosporin a dendrogram was generated with bionumerics software ( applied maths , sint - martens - latem , belgium ) . the pfge profile ( and if there were indistinguishable isolates in the pulsenet usa database [ www.cdc.gov/pulsenet ] , the corresponding centers for disease control and prevention pulsenet profile ) , the number of isolates , and the -lactamase genes are indicated . representative psti restriction profiles ( a ) and blacmy-2 southern hybridization ( b ) of plasmids from escherichia coli dh10b transformants of cmy-2producing salmonella spp . clinical isolates . lane 1 , dh10b/00 - 7490 ;

smaller bands ( in particular , the 0.8-kb band ) are not well visualized . alkaline lysis extraction showed that all but 1 of the newport mdr - ampc isolates harbored a plasmid > 125 kb that hybridized with a blacmy-2 probe ; the remaining isolate harbored a plasmid of 100 kb ( appendix table ) . analysis with s1 nuclease showed that these plasmids were 100 kb370 kb . up to 3 additional plasmids ( 3.5 kb100 kb ) that did not have blacmy-2 were detected in most isolates ( appendix table ) . cephalosporin resistance was transferred by electroporation of plasmid dna to eschericha coli dh10b for all 38 cmy-2positive isolates tested . when present in the donor strain , resistance to sulfonamides , chloramphenicol , and tetracycline was also transferred . restriction analysis of plasmids isolated from transformants showed 6 similar restriction profiles for newport isolates ( r1r6 ) ( figure 2 , appendix table ) . newport plasmids r1r6 and agona plasmid r8 were shown by pcr to contain variant a / c2 replicons ( 13 ) , whereas typhimurium plasmid r7 contained the i1 replicon . psti - digested plasmids analyzed by southern hybridization with a blacmy-2 probe ( figure 2 ) showed 4 hybridization profiles among newport isolates . profiles h2 , h3 , and h4 differed from h1 by 1 additional band ( > 10 kb for h2 , 3.2 kb for h3 , and > 18 kb for h4 ) , which indicated that the blacmy-2 gene was partially or totally duplicated . newport mdr - ampc isolates have been the source of sporadic cases and small outbreaks in humans in france during 20002005 . all isolates had the same mlst type , st45 , and highly similar xbai - pfge profiles . their plasmids carrying blacmy-2 were homogeneous ( same incompatibility group a / c2 , a main restriction type r1 , and a main hybridization type h1 ) . these results support clonal expansion of 1 newport strain ( or a limited number of genetically related newport strains ) able to acquire and maintain a large inca / c2 mdr plasmid . however , this strain was not found in french food animals or domestically produced food products ( additional information available from fxweill@pasteur.fr ) . further investigation identified the source as a wholesaler who imported meat from belgium , the united kingdom , hungary , canada , brazil , argentina , uruguay , and australia ( 12 ) . in contrast to europe , newport mdr - ampc has been frequently seen in the united states during the past decade . furthermore , several characteristics were shared between us and french newport mdr - ampc isolates : st45 ( 15 ) , pfge profiles new5 , new6a , and new6b ( displayed by 15 isolates among the 45 studied ) , and blacmy-2 plasmid hybridization type h1 ( 14 ) . we can reasonably hypothesize that during 20002005 some isolates likely entered france from north america through imported food . alternatively , they could have come to france and north america from some other country .","the multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) salmonella enterica serotype newport strain that produces cmy-2 -lactamase ( newport mdr - ampc ) was the source of sporadic cases and outbreaks in humans in france during 20002005 . because this strain was not detected in food animals , it was most likely introduced into france through imported food products .",79
"tuberculosis ( tb ) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world and the second leading infectious cause of death among adult globally . the risk factors for the development of tuberculosis include immigration , low income populations , immunosuppression , human immunodeficiency virus , and living in close contact with patients suffering from tuberculosis [ 2 , 3 ] . the precise incidence of genital tb can not be determined with certainty as some cases are asymptomatic and uncovered accidentally during investigation of infertility . in developing countries , genital the symptoms and signs of abdominopelvic tb can mimic peritoneal carcinosis or ovarian malignancy . based on iranian national health program , it is more than 50 years that all iranian newborn will receive vaccination against tb after delivery and before releasing from the hospital . but in cities close to the country borders , cases of tb have been reported mainly due to immigration from neighborhood countries particularly afghanistan , pakistan and iraq . although pulmonary tb can be diagnosed by its particular signs and symptoms as well as laboratory and imaging assessment , peritoneal tb has common symptoms with advanced ovarian carcinoma , including pelvic pain , mass , ascites , and elevated serum ca125 levels . based on literature review some other case reports showed ambiguity in the differentiation between peritoneal tuberculosis and advanced ovarian cancer before operation [ 2 , 57 ] . therefore , preoperative diagnosis between these two distinct diseases continues to be a dilemma . we presented three cases of peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking ovarian malignancy to point out    the importance of the histopathologic diagnosis before chemotherapy in women suspected having advanced ovarian cancer , especially if there is a family history of pulmonary tb or infertility . three women with abdominopelvic tb were operated during one year in taleghani hospital with preoperative suspicious of ovarian malignancy . case 1 a 24-year - old married , nulligravid woman was referred from gasteroentrology ward to the gynecologic ward with the complain of abdominal pain and distension , nausea , on and off vomiting in the preceding 3 months . her past medical history was unremarkable but in gynecologic history hypomenorrhea was highlighted ( figure 1 ) . family history revealed that her father had been diagnosed with pulmory tb , also her cousin had been involved with genital tb . during physical examination , she was a pale young lady with a distended abdomen and a fixed mass palpated up to the umbilicus . in her paraclinic investigations , among all serum tumor markers related to ovarian cancer , there was only a mild elevation of ca-125 ( 45  u / ml ) hemoglobin was 9.0  mg / dl . as she had a positive family history for tb a chest x - ray and skin tuberculin test have been performed and both were negative for tb.pelvic ultrasonography showed a normal size uterus with endometrial thickness equal to 5  mm . there was a septated multicystic mass of 134  140  81  mm cube in right adnexa with extension toward the left adnexa . left   ovary was also bigger than normal ( 70  35 )  mm containing multiple follicles . sonographic impression was mucinous cystadenoma of ovary or hydatid cyst.abdominopelvic computed tomography showed large amount of ascites in peritoneal cavity with cystic and solid vegetative mass , mild thickening of peritoneal layers in lower abdomen suggesting ovarian mucinous cystadenocarcinoma with peritoneal metastasis was noted . other possibilities suggested were primary carcinoma of mesenteric , peritoneal like mesothelium , or papillary carcinoma of peritoneum.because of highly suggestion of ovarian malignancy preoperation , the patient underwent exploratory laparatomy with midline incision . total volume of 400cc ascitic fluid was aspirated and sent for cytology and culture . adhesions were released . then left ovary 5  5  6  cm appeared with hemorrhagic cyst and adhesion to the left fallopian tube . a 24-year -

ray and skin tuberculin test has been performed and both were negative for tb.profiling of serum tumor markers and revealed a high level of ca-125 : 207  u / ml . hemoglobin was 10  mg%.pelvic ultrasonography disclosed uterus and adnexa as a large complex cystic mass shifting to the right with extensive adhesion to the adjacent structures . as the preoperation assessment was in favour of ovarian malignancy , the patient underwent exploratory laparatomy with a midline incision . there was no ascites , but miliary seeding all over the peritoneum and small bowel and large bowel , uterus , fallopian tubes and ovaries were seen , which were biopsied . a confluent mass containing uterus , ovaries and fallopian tube was seen which was necrotic . the frozen sections of the biopsied specimens showed granulation tissue , but as the family was completed and the mass was necrotic , hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy have been done . the permanent result of pathology showed many granulomatous lesion comprised epithelial cells , histiocytes , giant cells . right ovary and right tube were unremarkable , left ovary , fallopian tube and uterus had granulomatous lesion consistent with tuberculosis . old married woman gravida 6 , para 6 has been transferred to the gynecologic ward from the gasteroentrology ward with the complain of abdominal pain , weight loss and fever in the last 4 months ( figure 2 ) . her past medical history was unremarkable , and in her surgical history , last 2 deliveries were through cesarean section and she performed the tubal ligation . it is worth to mention that her normal menstrual pattern has been changed to oligomenorrhea since last 6 months . she had also a positive family history ; her mother had been diagnosed with pulmonary tb .   her abdominopelvic examination revealed a fixed and tender mass in the pelvis . as case 1 ,   due to positive family history for tb , a chest x - ray and skin tuberculin test has been performed and both were negative for tb . profiling of serum tumor markers and revealed a high level of ca-125 : 207  u / ml . pelvic ultrasonography disclosed uterus and adnexa as a large complex cystic mass shifting to the right with extensive adhesion to the adjacent structures . as the preoperation assessment was in favour of ovarian malignancy , the patient underwent exploratory laparatomy with a midline incision . there was no ascites , but miliary seeding all over the peritoneum and small bowel and large bowel , uterus , fallopian tubes and ovaries were seen , which were biopsied . a confluent mass containing uterus , ovaries and fallopian tube was seen which was necrotic . the frozen sections of the biopsied specimens showed granulation tissue , but as the family was completed and the mass was necrotic , hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo oophorectomy have been done . the permanent result of pathology showed many granulomatous lesion comprised epithelial cells , histiocytes , giant cells . right ovary and right tube were unremarkable , left ovary , fallopian tube and uterus had granulomatous lesion consistent with tuberculosis . case 3 a 57-year - old married woman , gravida 9 , para 8 , consulted with   the gynecologic ward by gasteroentrology consultant and then admitted complaining abdominal pain and distension since last two months ( figure 3 ) . she lost 10  kg during these 2 months which is highly suggestive of a serious problem . ultrasonography showed normal liver , spleen , kidneys , and uterus , but showed cystic masses in both adnexa with septation in favour of malignancy . so laparatomy with midline incision was done with impression of ovarian malignancy.about one liter ascites aspirated and omental cake with miliary seeding , which were seen all over the peritoneum and pelvic organs and over the liver and spleen , has been biopsied . ovarian masses were removed and sent for frozen sections along with the other biopsied specimens with the result of granulomatosis . because of necrotic and hemorrhagic appearance of uterus and ovaries as well as the patient 's age and condition total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy were done to prevent postoperation complications . right ovary with granulomatous inflammation in favour of tb ascitic fluid cytology showed inflammatory cells . patient was discharged with antituberculosis drugs.all three cases were in very good status in 6 months followup with normal pelvic exam , normal pelvic ultrasonography and ca125 measurement . 
  a 57-year - old married woman , gravida 9 , para 8 , consulted with   the gynecologic ward by gasteroentrology consultant and then admitted complaining abdominal pain and distension since last two months ( figure 3 ) . she lost 10  kg during these 2 months which is highly suggestive of a serious problem . ultrasonography showed normal liver , spleen , kidneys , and uterus , but showed cystic masses in both adnexa with septation in favour of malignancy . about one liter ascites aspirated and omental cake with miliary seeding , which were seen all over the peritoneum and pelvic organs and over the liver and spleen , has been biopsied . ovarian masses were removed and sent for frozen sections along with the other biopsied specimens with the result of granulomatosis . because of necrotic and hemorrhagic appearance of uterus and ovaries as well as the patient 's age and condition total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy were done to prevent postoperation complications . right ovary with granulomatous inflammation in favour of tb ascitic fluid cytology showed inflammatory cells . all three cases were in very good status in 6 months followup with normal pelvic exam , normal pelvic ultrasonography and ca125 measurement . peritoneal tb with nonspecific symptoms mimicking ovarian malignancy is a serious problem especially in developing countries . diagnosis of peritoneal tb before operation is not easy , there is no particular laboratory or imaging assessment to differentiate this disease from advanced ovarian cancer . in our 3 cases diagnosed with abdominopelvic tb , two were in reproductive age ( cases 1 and 2 ) and one postmenopausal ( case 3 ) . all the cases were admitted firstly to gasteroentrology due to abdominopelvic pain and distension and then transferred to gynecology oncology ward with the diagnosis of advanced ovarian malignancy . adnexal mass suspicious of   malignancy in ct scan and/or sonography and elevated ca125 were seen in all cases . family history for pulmonary tb was positive in cases 1 and 2 and genital tb for case 1 . the first two cases had a history of oligomenorrhea and hypomenorrhea in the last year before surgery . due to the positive family history , peritoneal as previous case reports [ 7 , 8 ] in all our 3 cases   non - invasive tests , such as acid - fast stain and culture of the ascitic fluid , ultrasonographic features of the abdomen and pelvis ,   ct , as well as serum ca125 level were nonspecific for differentiating abdominopelvic tb from ovarian malignancy . in our 3 cases , because of   ambiguity of the results of non invasive tests , explorative laparotomy with a midline incision has been done before treatment . ascites or peritoneal washings were sent for cytology as well as bacteriologic examination which was negative for both malignant cell as well as tb miliary deposits all over . the omentum or peritoneal surfaces were seen and assessed by frozen - section analysis , which detected granulamotous inflammation with central necrosis highly suggestive of tuberculous peritonitis . therefore , although tuberculin skin test may be helpful but might be negative , as in our cases , it might be positive because vaccination is a national program in our country . the ca125 level , which is elevated in more than half of early and two thirds of advanced epithelial ovarian malignancy , can be increased in peritoneal tb [ 9 , 10 ] . predictive value , specificity , and sensitivity of this marker to reveal epithelial ovarian malignancy are less in premenopausal than postmenopausal due to other benign conditions [ 11 , 12 ] . therefore , in areas where tb is endemic , in premenopausal women with elevated ca125 , this infection should be considered . some studies assessed new diagnostic tools to differentiate abdominopelvic tb from malignamcy before treatment . ( 1998 ) studied the polymerase chain reaction for mycobacteria but they reported a negative results in cases of peritoneal tuberculosis mimicking advanced ovarian cancer . tinelli ( 2008 )   suggested that abdominopelvic laparoscopy with histopathological findings plus enzyme - linked immuno - spot can confirm the suspect of ap - tb . although we were unable to perform the last two investigations , their validity is still under investigation . consequently , we suggest a laparatomy and biopsy of involved area as the gold standard method for definite differentiation between advanced ovarian malignancy and peritoneal tb especially in endemic areas for tb with limitations of using new or expensive technology . although some studies suggest laparoscopic biopsy for histologic diagnosis , we preferred a minilaparatomy to decrease the complications of laparoscopic entrance to the abdomen with extensive adhesions between loop of intestines , abdominal wall , and pelvic organs seen in abdominopelvic tb . although this report was not a case control study but it seems that removing the infected pelvic masses from the field of the operation before beginning the medical therapy is beneficial .   in conclusion , cytology or histopathologic verification of ovarian malignancy before beginning of aggressive therapy including debulking and or adjuvant chemotherapy is mandatory . based on these cases , even in the presence of symptoms and signs highly suggestive of ovarian malignancy , the presence of familial history of pulmonary and/or peritoneal tb along with complaining of oligomenorrhea or hypomenorrhea with   low socioeconomic situation are enough markers for the physician to rule out abdominopelvic tb .     women living on the border of our country , close to immigrants campus are mostly at risk to develop the tb . therefore , taking a precise personal and family history as well as geographic and socioeconomic status of the patients will be helpful . considering this , we suggest that all families , friends , and people living in the vicinity of women diagnosed with tb   should be called through a national health program to be tested for tb and treated accordingly .","genital tb may present as on abdominopelvic mass mimicking ovarian malignancy because clinical and laboratory findings are similar . 
 family history is very important and should be considered for differential diagnosis . 
 three cases of genital tb with presentation of abdominopelvic masses and with no signs and symptoms of tb were presented . 
 two of them had positive family history of pulmonary tb . 
 tissue diagnosis was the best method for diagnosis of genital tb , but it should be reminded that if positive family history of tb was present , mini laparotomy should be done to take biopsy and to make rapid diagnosis before treatment .",123
"these include the 
 intrinsic flexor pollicis brevis , flexor pollicis longus , lumbricalis , flexor brevis , and 
 flexor longus muscles1 . toe - gripping 
 strength is measured in the sitting position with the trunk vertical , the hip and knee 
 joints at 90 , and the ankle joint in the neutral position1,2,3 . low toe - gripping strength is a risk factor of falls for the 
 elderly , and several studies have reported that toe - gripping strength is lower in subjects 
 with a history of falls than in those with no history of falls1,2,3,4 . furthermore , toe - gripping 
 strength can be increased by training5 , 
 which can decrease the risk of falls1 . souma et al.6 studied the % iemg of 
 several crural muscles ( the soleus muscle , medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle , and 
 tibialis anterior ) during toe - gripping in 3 different ankle joint positions10 of plantar 
 flexion and 0 and 10 of dorsiflexion  and reported that the crural muscles help the ankle 
 joint by co - contracting during toe - gripping . in another study , nakae et al.7 calculated the % iemg of the same muscles 
 during toe - gripping with subjects seated on the edge of a seat or standing , and reported 
 that the % iemg of the medial gastrocnemius muscle was significantly lower when subjects were 
 seated than when they were standing . however , as both studies focused on the activity of the 
 crural muscles , the activity of the femoral muscles during toe - gripping remains unclear . we 
 believe it is important to elucidate the contribution of femoral muscles to toe - gripping 
 strength . in the present study , we investigated femoral muscle activity during toe - gripping to 
 examine the role of the femoral muscles in toe - gripping strength . their 
 average ( mean  sd ) age , height , and body weight were 20.6  1.0  years , 159.4  6.3  cm , and 
 51.8  5.8  kg , respectively . this study was approved by the ethics committee for human 
 research of tohoku fukushi university , and written informed consent was received from all of 
 the subjects after the purpose of the study had been explained to them . toe - gripping strength of the dominant toe and emg activity of the ipsilateral thigh were 
 synchronously recorded to assess the activity of the rectus femoris and biceps femoris 
 muscles . toe - gripping strength was measured using a toe - gripping dynamometer ( t.k.k.3360 ; 
 takei co , ltd , niigata , japan ) . as described by uritani8 , the subjects were instructed to sit with their trunk in the 
 vertical position , hip and knee joints at 90 , and ankle joints in the neutral position . after a sufficient 
 number of training trials and adequate rest , toe - gripping strength was measured twice and 
 the maximal force was used in the analysis . for all subjects , the right toe was dominant 
 ( defined as the toe used to kick a ball ) . to measure the maximum voluntary contraction ( mvc ) activity of the rectus femoris muscles , 
 as described by kai9 , each subject was 
 instructed to sit on a chair with the hip and knee joints at 90 , and to exert maximal 
 isometric force of knee extension while resisting an opposing force applied by the examiner . the emg was recorded for 3 seconds while each subject exerted maximal force of knee 
 extension . to measure the mvc of the biceps femoris muscle , each subject was instructed to 
 generate maximal isometric force of knee flexion while resisting an opposing force applied 
 by the examiner . the emg was recorded for 3 seconds while each subject exerted maximal force 
 of knee flexion . after confirmation of adequate skin preparation ( skin resistance of less 
 than 5 k ) , three bipolar lead electrodes ( de-2.1 , delsys , inc . , boston , usa ) were attached 
 to the skin over the rectus femoris and the long head of the biceps femoris , as described by 
 peroto10 . for measurement of the rectus femoris muscle , the electrode was attached at the midpoint between the superior edge of the 
 patella and the anterior superior iliac spine . for measurement of the long head of the 
 biceps femoris , the electrode was attached at the midpoint between the head of the fibula 
 and ischial tuberosity . the emg signal was collected using ml846 power lab 4/26 ( sample : 1,000  hz ; ad instruments 
 co. , ltd . ) and transferred to a personal computer . the bandwidth was 20500  hz . the emg 
 signal segment selected and integrated ( integrated electromyogram : iemg ) for analysis was 
 the middle 1  s of the entire 3-s duration of continuous maximal toe - gripping strength . the iemg was analyzed using lab chart pro v7.3.5 ( ad instruments co. , ltd . ) and normalized 
 to the iemg of each muscle s mvc . repeated mann - whitney u tests were used to compare the % iemg of the 
 rectus and biceps femoris muscles . relationships between the % iemg of the rectus and biceps 
 femoris muscles were statistically analyzed using spearman s correlation coefficient . the average ( mean  sd ) toe - gripping strength was 20.9  3.6  kg . the average ( mean  sd ) 
 % iemg values of the rectus and biceps femoris muscles were 7.0%  6.2% and 25.6%  15.9% , 
 respectively . the % iemg of the biceps femoris was significantly higher than that of the 
 rectus femoris ( p < 0.01 , table 1table 1.comparison of the % iemg values of the rectus femoris and biceps femoris muscles

 found between the % iemg of the rectus femoris and that of the biceps femoris ( r = 0.548 , p in the present study , we found that the % iemg of the biceps femoris was significantly 
 higher than that of the rectus femoris . moreover , a significant positive correlation was 
 found between the % iemg of these two muscles . these results suggest that femoral muscles 
 co - contract during toe - gripping action , and thus possibly contribute to knee joint 
 stability . we found that toe - gripping action stimulates femoral muscle activity and that the % iemg of 
 the biceps femoris was significantly higher than that of the rectus femoris . sato et 
 al.11 reported that during 
 toe - gripping , the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles are activated first , followed by the 
 gradual activation of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle . the biceps femoris 
 initiates knee flexion , and the medial head of the gastrocnemius is a synergist for knee 
 flexion . additionally , active tension of the biceps femoris decreases during toe - gripping in 
 knee flexion . this may be because the length of the biceps femoris is shorter during active 
 tension than during resting tension . we think that the activation of the biceps femoris 
 during toe - gripping was caused by increasing motor unit recruitment and synchronization of 
 the impulse to compensate for decreasing activity of the biceps femoris . in the present study , we found a significant positive correlation between the % iemg of the 
 rectus femoris and that of the biceps femoris . this suggests that the % iemg of the rectus 
 femoris increases with increases in the % iemg of the biceps femoris . toe - gripping strength was measured using a closed kinetic chain movement , and therefore , 
 the likelihood of movement in the directions of flexion or extension of the knee joint is 
 less . however , because the gastrocnemius also acts on knee joint flexion during exertion of 
 toe - gripping strength , the knee joint is readily displaced in the direction of flexion . to 
 prevent this , it is thought that the knee joint is immobilized by contraction of the rectus 
 femoris , that is , we think the rectus femoris during exertion of toe - gripping strength acts 
 in order to control the action of knee joint flexion by the gastrocnemius . first , we were unable to avoid the common problems that 
 negatively affect surface emg recording , such as skin resistance , artifacts , and the effects 
 of proximal muscles . second , as only healthy young women participated in this study , it is 
 difficult to extend our findings to the general population . in future studies , we need to 
 consider this aspect , and involve healthy young men and individuals of different age 
 groups .","[ purpose ] in the present study , we investigated femoral muscle activity during 
 toe - gripping , and the role of the femoral muscles in toe - gripping strength . 
 [ subjects ] 
 fourteen healthy young women were selected . 
 [ methods ] we measured the maximum voluntary 
 contraction of the rectus femoris and long head of the biceps femoris muscles . 
 we then 
 calculated the percent integrated emg ( % iemg ) during the toe - gripping action . 
 [ results ] we 
 found that the % iemg of the biceps femoris was significantly higher than that of the 
 rectus femoris . 
 moreover , a significant positive correlation was found between the % iemg 
 of the rectus femoris and that of the biceps femoris . 
 [ conclusion ] these results suggest 
 that femoral muscles co - contract during the toe - gripping action , and thus possibly 
 contribute to knee joint stability .",192
"nerve conduction studies ( ncs ) are an objective , quantitative , and reproducible measure of peripheral nerve function and are widely used in the diagnosis of neuropathies [ 1 , 2 ] . they can be used to monitor neuropathic disease progression   and the efficacy of interventions in clinical trials . however , non - uniform electrophysiologic test procedures degrade reproducibility . potential sources of variation include the use of different emg instruments at different test sessions or sites , inconsistent placement of recording and stimulating electrodes , use of non - standardized distance measurements , use of sub - maximal electrical stimuli , poor skin preparation resulting in high skin impedance , and failure to maintain limb temperature within an acceptable range or to compensate for temperature . all these factors may compromise the repeatability of ncs measurement and lead to erroneous diagnostic conclusions . aside from true physiological changes , factors that influence repeatability of ncs measurements are broadly grouped into two categories : inter - tester variability and intra - tester variability . inter - tester variability refers to variability of a test parameter measured on a single individual when repeat test measurements are made by two or more examiners . intra - tester variability refers to variability of a test parameter when repeat test measurements are made by a single examiner . in the absence of physiological changes , both inter - tester and intra - tester variability are influenced by electrodiagnostic examination technique . automated ncs instruments may improve ncs repeatability by utilizing prefabricated electrode arrays and automating evoked waveform analysis . the objective of this study is to quantify ncs repeatability utilizing the nc - stat ( neurometrix , inc . , waltham , massachusetts ) , an automated ncs system [ 810 ] . we hypothesized that use of the nc - stat system would yield highly reproducible ncs results . all were healthy office workers who lacked neurological complaints or known causes of peripheral neuropathy . the study was approved and monitored by an independent review board ( copernicus group , cary , nc , usa ) . each upper and lower extremity nerve was tested twice ( 7 days apart ) by the same technician , utilizing the nc - stat ( neurometrix , inc . , waltham , ma , usa ) , an automated ncs instrument . shown in figure 1 is a photograph of the nc - stat system components : pre - fabricated electrode arrays specific to peroneal nerve motor testing ; an electronic monitor to be connected to the electrode arrays for nerve stimulation and waveform acquisition and analysis ; a communication port to transmit data for report generation . the nc - stat system is fda 510(k ) cleared for the performance of motor studies of the median , ulnar , peroneal and tibial nerves , and sensory studies of the median , ulnar and sural nerves . tests were performed in a commercial office setting similar to a physician s office where nc - stat systems are typically used . each study lasted for about 2 weeks to complete the 7-day interval test - retest protocol for 15 subjects . a technician applied pre - fabricated electrode arrays specific to each nerve based on readily identifiable anatomic landmarks . the electrode arrays incorporated stimulating , recording , and ground electrodes , as well as a temperature sensor . the device automatically checked skin impedance and determined the minimum stimulator current needed to deliver a supramaximal stimulus with amplitude ranging from 10 to 100 ma and duration between 100 and 500 s . the evoked compound muscle ( cmap ) or compound sensory nerve ( snap ) action potentials were recorded following a series of supramaximal stimuli . supramaximal is defined as cmap amplitudes having less than 10% variation from their mean for three stimuli of increasing intensities ( step size varies between 2.5 and 20 ma depending on nerve and stimulus duration ) . snaps are acquired at the motor supramaximal stimulation level since nc - stat recorded both motor and sensory responses simultaneously to minimize overall stimulus count . time interval between stimuli is about 23 s. the technician was trained according to the manufacturer s instructions and was blinded to the prior test results during the retest . it consists of three components : pre - fabricated electrode arrays ( biosensor , left panel ) for a peroneal motor nerve conduction study , an electronic monitor ( connected to a biosensor during testing ) , a report generation system ( not shown ) based on electrophysiological data collected and processed by the monitor and transmitted via  docking station  ( a telecommunication port for secure data transfer via telephone line ) . it consists of three components : pre -

conducted median motor response generated by abductor pollicis brevis was recorded using paired electrodes placed over the lateral and medial aspects of the distal wrist crease . concurrently , an antidromic snap was recorded from the middle finger using self - adhering ring electrodes placed around the proximal interphalangeal ( pip ) joint ( active electrode ) , with the inactive electrode 3 cm distal . the ulnar stimulating cathode was placed over the medial volar wrist 3 cm proximal to the distal wrist crease . the ulnar motor response was recorded using an active electrode placed over abuductor digiti minimi and an inactive electrode placed over the lateral volar wrist . the ulnar snap was recorded from the small finger with the active electrode over the pip and inactive electrode 2 cm distal . the stimulator cathode for peroneal testing was placed lateral to the tibia at the intermalleolar line . responses were recorded using detector pairs placed along a line between the lateral malleolus and the 3rd toe , over the vicinity of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle ( see figure 1 ) . for tibial nerve testing , stimulating cathode was placed over the posterior tibial nerve just posterior to the medial malleolus . a ground electrode and temperature sensor were interposed between stimulating and recording electrodes in all cases . at the conclusion of ncs for a given subject , motor responses ( cmap and f - wave ) were recorded with filter settings of 15 hz high pass and 3 khz low pass ; sensory responses were recorded with 175 hz high pass and 3 khz low pass filters . supramaximal cmap and snap were sampled at 10 khz and f - waves were acquired at 2.5 khz . for recording snaps , 615 individual waveforms were averaged depending upon the signal - to - noise ratio . up to 10 f - wave responses ( with 12 traces as a maximum ) up to 20 peroneal and tibial f -

wave onset latency was identified for each trace with an identified f - wave response ( traces with +  , right panel of figure 2 ) , and their average was reported as the mean f - wave latency ( vertical dotted line ) . the distal sensory latency ( dsl ) was measured from stimulus onset to the initial negative peak ( upward deflection ) of the snap ( open circle in the upper left panel of figure 2 ) . the snap amplitude was measured peak to peak ( negative - positive , or vertical distance between open and closed circles ) . all motor and sensory latencies were adjusted for deviation of skin surface temperature from reference values ( 32 c upper extremity , 30 c lower extremity ) with a linear correction formula : latency(corrected ) = latency ( raw))corrcoef(temperature - reference ) . the temperature correction factor corrcoef was previously determined in an independent study population ( 150 subjects , data on file ) , which also found dependence of cmap and snap amplitude on temperature to be not statistically significant . statistical measures used to quantify ncs repeatability mirrored those used in prior studies [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . the pearson product - moment correlation ( cc ) was used to assess the association between ncs parameters obtained 7 days apart . intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) was used to determine the agreement between the two tests . coefficient of variation ( cov ) of test - retest ncs parameters was calculated and the average over all nerves was reported . relative intertrial variation ( riv ) the riv is the difference between two tests as a percentage of the average of the two tests . because of the small sample size , 10th and 90th percentiles of riv were calculated for all parameters to minimize the impact of outliers . to facilitate comparison , the 5th and 95th percentile values , as reported by others , were also obtained for selected parameters . the mean and standard deviation of the difference between the test and retest results paired t - tests were carried out to ensure that two tests yielded ncs parameters with the same mean . all were healthy office workers who lacked neurological complaints or known causes of peripheral neuropathy . the study was approved and monitored by an independent review board ( copernicus group , cary , nc , usa ) . each upper and lower extremity nerve was tested twice ( 7 days apart ) by the same technician , utilizing the nc -

reference ) . the temperature correction factor corrcoef was previously determined in an independent study population ( 150 subjects , data on file ) , which also found dependence of cmap and snap amplitude on temperature to be not statistically significant . statistical measures used to quantify ncs repeatability mirrored those used in prior studies [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . the pearson product - moment correlation ( cc ) intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) was used to determine the agreement between the two tests . coefficient of variation ( cov ) of test - retest ncs parameters was calculated and the average over all nerves was reported . relative intertrial variation ( riv ) the riv is the difference between two tests as a percentage of the average of the two tests . because of the small sample size , 10th and 90th percentiles of riv were calculated for all parameters to minimize the impact of outliers . to facilitate comparison , the 5th and 95th percentile values , as reported by others , the mean and standard deviation of the difference between the test and retest results were also reported . paired t - tests were carried out to ensure that two tests yielded ncs parameters with the same mean . their ages ranged from 24 to 52 years ( mean 37.1 , sd 8.6 years ) . height varied from 157 to 180 cm ( mean 173 , sd 7.9 cm ) . total of 15 subjects ( 5 females ) volunteered for the lower extremity repeatability study and nine of them had also enrolled in the upper extremity study . their age range was 2247 years ( mean 32.6 , sd 8.2 years ) and height range was 157180 cm ( mean 172 , sd 8.2 cm ) . the rivs for mean fwl at 5th and 95th percentiles were [ 11.4% , 9.4% ] , [ 5.1% , 3.3% ] , [ 4.9% , 4.5% ] , and [ 2.8% , 4.0% ] , respectively , for median , ulnar , peroneal , and tibial nerves . at p = 0.05 level , paired t - tests indicated that the means of all test and retest ncs parameters were the same . pearson ccs for all latency parameters were greater than 0.80 with the exception of median nerve mean fwl ( cc = 0.69 ) . all upper extremity amplitude parameters had ccs greater than 0.85 . for lower extremity nerves , all latency results were based on temperature corrected latencies . without temperature compensation , latency parameters exhibited lower repeatability . for example , the cc values for ulnar nerve dml , mean fwl , and dsl without temperature correction were 0.72 , 0.93 , and 0.72 , respectively . standard deviation of the difference between test and retest results would have been 0.31 , 1.04 , and 0.34 . table 1statistical measures of nerve conduction study parameter repeatabilityriv percentiles(day 8day 1)nerveccicccov10th ( % ) 90th ( % ) meanstdevpaired t -

retest repeatability . in comparison with that study , the riv ( 5th and 95th percentile ) for tibial nerve f - wave latency was tighter in our study ( [ 2.8% , 4.0% ] vs. [ 4.6% , 5.7% ] ) while the relationship was reversed for median nerve fwave latency results ( [ 11.4% , 9.4% ] vs. [ 6.7% , 6.7% ] ) . decreased repeatability of median nerve f - wave latency may be attributed to the lower amplitude signal - to - noise ratio as median nerve f - waves were acquired via a volume - conduction recording technique . indeed , latency repeatability was much higher for ulnar f - waves recorded directly over the muscle . the icc for ulnar f - wave latency was 0.92 in our study , higher than the icc of 0.59 reported in a similar study of 49 healthy adults . salerno and colleagues studied upper extremity sensory test -

 their median , ulnar , peroneal , and tibial nerves were tested twice ( 7  days apart ) by the same technician with an nc - stat instrument . 
 pre - fabricated electrode arrays specific to each nerve were used . both motor responses 
 ( compound motor action potential [ cmap ] and f - waves all nerves ) and sensory responses ( sensory nerve action potentials [ snap ] median and ulnar nerves only ) were recorded following supramaximal stimuli . 
 automated algorithms determined all ncs parameters : distal motor latency ( dml ) , mean f - wave latency ( fwl ) , distal sensory latency ( dsl ) , cmap amplitude , and snap amplitude . 
 latency was adjusted for skin temperature deviation from reference . 
 pearson correlation coefficient ( cc ) , intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) , coefficient of variance ( cov ) , and relative intertrial variation ( riv ) were calculated.resultsfifteen subjects participated in either upper or lower extremity studies with nine participating in both . with the exception of cmap amplitude , all parameters had cov less than 0.06 . 
 upper extremity amplitude parameters had ccs greater than 0.85 . 
 ccs for latencies were greater than 0.80 except for the median nerve fwl ( cc  =  0.69 ) . 
 for lower extremity nerves , iccs were highest for mean fwl ( > 0.90 ) , followed by dml ( > 0.82 ) and then cmap ( peroneal 0.33 , tibial 0.73 ) . 
 the 10th to 90th riv percentiles were bounded by 7% for f - wave latencies ;  9% for all dsls ; and  11% for dml ( except peroneal at 15%).conclusionsthe reproducibility of ncs parameters obtained with an automated ncs instrument compared favorably with traditional electromyography laboratories . 
 f - wave latencies had the highest repeatability , followed by dml , dsl , snap and cmap amplitude . given their high reproducibility , automated ncs instrument may encourage wider utilization of ncs in clinical and research applications .",494
"a 28-year - old healthy male was seen in our clinic complaining of vision loss in his right eye ( od ) . best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) was od : 20/200 and left eye ( os ) : 20/20 . mild vascular abnormalities were detected in the temporal aspect of right optic nerve , but no conclusive information was obtained . oct using the stratus oct 3 model ( carl zeiss meditec , jena , germany ) was indicated for the evaluation of the macular areas , rnfl thicknesses , and optic nerves . the fast macular protocol revealed subtle macular thickness beyond normal in the superior and nasal quadrants of both maculae . no visible alterations in the internal microarchitecture of the retina were observed using several retinal lines and optic disc protocols . a slight incremental thickening of the rnfl was observed in the superior and nasal quadrants of the os . in order to evaluate the patient 's visual field ( vf ) and retinal sensitivities , a frequency doubling technology perimetry ( fdt ) , using the commercially available ( matrix ) device , was performed in both eyes . the threshold 30 - 2 strategy revealed the presence of junctional scotoma composed by a central scotoma in od associated with superior temporal quadrantanopia in the fellow eye . the pattern detected in the vf suggested the presence of an expansive mass at the level of the optic chiasm [ fig . 1 ] . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) was performed which disclosed the presence of a tumor , compatible with the diagnosis of pituitary adenoma [ fig . 2 ] . after a complete neurological evaluation , medical treatment with cabergoline ( a dopamine agonist ) , after 8 months , a significant reduction of tumor volume was achieved . moreover , the patient experienced a full recovery of bcva and vf [ fig . 3 ] . right : superior temporal quadrantanopia in os central nervous system mri . left : pituitary dependent macroadenoma . visual loss associated with a junctional scotoma is a well - known clinical sign related with the presence of a compressive mass in the chiasmal area . monteiro described a generalized reduction of the rnfl thickness in the retinas of patients with band atrophy secondary to pituitary tumors . lederer and colleagues reported on the usefulness of the macular map thickness , while studying patients with glaucomatous optic nerve alterations . due to a relative incremental change in the ganglion cells axonal concentration within the macular area interestingly , the patient described here showed a thickening in the nasal and superior and nasal aspects of both maculae . this tomographic sign , not visible on the biomicroscopic fundus examination and in the fa , was interpreted as an early retinal manifestation produced by the presence of the tumor . the physiopathology of this localized , incremental thickness is merely speculative , but could be produced by an alteration in the axonal transport in ganglion cells . after obstruction of the axoplasmic flow , an early enlargement ( intracellular edema ) of the nerve fibers followed by a chronic atrophy could occur . though no direct evidence exists corroborating this phenomenon , at least three indirect clinical issues support this theory : ( 1 ) the retinal thickness increment was revealed anatomically by the oct , but no evidence of dye leakage was seen in the fa . ( 2 ) the presence of a topographic correlation between the junction scotoma and the macular thickening . ( 3 ) the visual loss was ipsilateral to the main tumor location . furthermore , the macular thickness enlargement was symmetric while the visual alteration was roughly asymmetric . this most likely could be indicative of the potential for intracellular edema preceding the visual function alteration and this thickening could be an early sign that could be detected before consolidated fiber atrophy occurs . frequency doubling technology perimetry ( matrix  fdt ) has shown to be a suitable method for studying and detecting abnormalities in patients with neurological visual field deficits . during the functional evaluation of this patient , the fdt revealed the presence of a junctional scotoma compatible with the tumor location . even with an asymmetric vf defect , the oct was able to show symmetric involvement , with respect to macular thickness . we speculate that the anatomical alteration revealed by the oct precedes the functional deficit found in the vf . thus , we propose that detection of bi - superonasal macular edema ( me ) could be an early sign of chiasmal pathology . with an early diagnosis and subsequent treatment , a complete restoration of visual function was achieved in this case , stressing the importance of early recognition of the disease . we are unaware of previous reports regarding localized bi - superonasal me secondary to a pituitary adenoma and could find no references to it in the medical literature . studies including a cohort of patients are warranted for the evaluation of these tomographic findings . in conclusion , it is important to suspect pituitary adenoma in cases of vf deficit and oct macular alterations .","a 28-year - old healthy male complaining of vision loss in his right eye was discovered to have localized bi - nasal macular edema in the presence of a pituitary adenoma . 
 the presence of a junctional scotoma composed by a central scotoma in the right eye associated with superior temporal quadrantanopia in the fellow eye was seen . 
 the pattern detected in the visual field suggested the presence of an expansive mass at the level of the optic chiasm . 
 optical coherence tomography findings also revealed subtle macular thickness beyond normal in the superior and nasal quadrants of both maculae . 
 this report illustrates the importance of suspecting a pituitary adenoma in the light of uncharacteristic retinal alterations .",147
"arrhythmias can develop from intraatrial invasion , which can also lead to massive pericardial effusion and tamponade . if the tumor mass is located in the left atrium or ventricle , embolic infarction might occur . a 55-year - old man presented signs of progressive cardiac decompensation during the last 4 months due to tumorous obstruction of the mitral valve . in 2014 the patient underwent resection of a suspected myxoma ( 824124 mm ) in the left atrium . however , in the histological workup , the tumor mass , resected from the posterior mitral annulus , was diagnosed as chondrosarcoma . in 2014 , our colleagues in the referring center noticed nodal calcification in the myocardium and the mitral valve . the tumor board in 2014 decided on palliative care with poor sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation and high risk for organ toxicity . ct scan and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed no signs of malignancy outside the cardiac tissue , and the chondrosarcoma found was the primary tumor . during the course of 12 months , the patient was in a clinically stable state with combined mild mitral valve regurgitation and stenosis and good left ventricular pump function , with ejection fraction ( ef ) 63% . in january 2016 , the patient first presented with recurring tumor mass on the posterior mitral leaflet ( pml ) max . 23 mm , with moderately decreasing pump function ( ef 58% ) . in april 2016 , the patient showed increasing peripheral edema and orthopnea , with no signs of angina pectoris , and nyha iii - iv . the patient presented absolute arrhythmia with atrial fibrillation , pulse 109/min , and blood pressure 82/52 mmhg . echocardiography showed pleural effusions on both sides and distended vena cava inferior and hepatic veins . upon admission to our center , the patient presented a 403532 mm mass , originating from the pml ( figure 1 ) . a cardio mri could not be performed , as the patient was unable to lie down flat due to major orthopnea . instead , we decided to perform a cardio ct , which showed atrial roof and interatrial septum invasion . it was not perfectly clear on the ct scan whether the tumor was infiltrating the ascending aorta . a cerebral scan showed no signs of cerebral embolisms or metastasis . due to clinical instability serum creatinine levels at that point were 1.56 mg / dl and bilirubin 1.10 mg / dl . after careful review of the scan images , we decided on the implantation of a total artificial heart , as the sarcoma had already invaded the whole atrium and the complete mitral valve annulus . a mitral valve replacement was not feasible because there would be no myocardium or endocardium to fixate the stitches in . implantation of a self - expanding stent valve would also require an intact mitral valve annulus . furthermore , autotransplantation was rejected for the same reasons . the severe mitral valve stenosis precluded use of a left ventricular assist device ( lvad ) or biventricular assist device ( bivad ) . the new approach introduced by bruckner et al . has never been performed in our center and needs experience in the surgical technique as the construction of the new atria presents major challenges because they easily collapse when not prepared properly . we decided on the syncardia total artificial heart ( tah ) ( syncardia , tucson , az ) . as the ct scan showed no metastases and the sarcoma presented as a recurrence in the left atrium , we hoped that the patient could be listed for htx following recovery after tah implantation . in a similar setting , reich et al . successfully transplanted a patient after tah implantation , with an occult intracardial malignancy , after a cancer - free period of 14 months . before the operation , the patient and next of kin were informed that it would be an ultimo ratio intervention because we could not 100% foresee the invasion of the myocardium and the intraoperative circumstances . zhang et al . demonstrated a 50% survival rate after initial surgical treatment of primary cardiac sarcomas , depending on histological grade of the tumor . surgical treatment is the most common approach to improve survival . even as a palliative measure , reducing the tumor mass through an operation relieves orthopnea and ameliorates signs of decompensation if the patient stabilizes after the intervention . after re - sternotomy following aortic cross - clamping , the apex , ascending aorta , and pulmonary trunk were distally resected , preserving both the aortic and pulmonary valve . the left atrium showed infiltration of the intraatrial septum by the sarcoma after resection of the mitral valve ( figure 2 ) . due to extensive left atrial resection , a bovine pericardial patch was implanted to expand the pulmonary vein orifice with a 4 - 0 prolene suture . functional valve movements were tested and tah chambers were put in the av - annuli , followed by de - aeration of both tah chambers . to allow postoperative tissue edema , we decided to leave the thorax open . after sufficient volume substitution , the patient was transferred to the icu under moderate catecholamine support and no ventilation . five days after the initial operation , we planned a secondary thorax closure . during the intervention cerebral ct showed vast media infarction with hyper - dense blood appositions and perifocal edema with elapsed grey / white matter differentiation and early compression of the left posterior horn , with ongoing hemorrhagic transformation . neurological examination showed the patient was comatose , with slight head movement to the left side . a right - sided facial paralysis was diagnosed . under continuous anticoagulation for tah , there was a major risk for secondary bleeding due to the size of the media infarction . . the patient showed signs of prolonged low - output syndrome with beginning multiorgan failure . neurological status was deemed unfavorable and after consultation with the family , the patient died on postoperative day 16 after withdrawal of support . histological workup showed a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm with spindle cell formations and heterologous chondroid and osseous components , with dystrophic calcifications . chromogenic in situ hybridization could not confirm an amplification of mdm2-gene , and translocation of syt - gene locus was ruled out . hence , the classification was undifferentiated high - grade spindle cell sarcoma , grade 2 using the french fdration nationale des centres de lutte contre le cancer ( fnclcc ) grading . cardiopulmonary bypass was established via the ascending aorta and venae cavae cannulation . following aortic cross - clamping , the apex , ascending aorta , and pulmonary trunk the left atrium showed infiltration of the intraatrial septum by the sarcoma after resection of the mitral valve ( figure 2 ) . the atrial cuffs were prepared and broad felt strips for suture support were placed . due to extensive left atrial resection , a bovine pericardial patch was implanted to expand the pulmonary vein orifice with a 4 - 0 prolene suture . functional valve movements were tested and tah chambers were put in the av - annuli , followed by de - aeration of both tah chambers . to allow postoperative tissue edema , we decided to leave the thorax open . after sufficient volume substitution , the patient was transferred to the icu under moderate catecholamine support and no ventilation . five days after the initial operation , we planned a secondary thorax closure . during the intervention cerebral ct showed vast media infarction with hyper -

gene locus was ruled out . hence , the classification was undifferentiated high - grade spindle cell sarcoma , grade 2 using the french fdration nationale des centres de lutte contre le cancer ( fnclcc ) grading . chondrosarcomas are cartilaginous tissue sarcomas . our patient was first diagnosed with primary cardiac chondrosarcoma . after initial resection , relapse of the cardiac mass in the left atrium was diagnosed as early as 14 months later . after excision of the heart for tah implantation , our pathologists found an undifferentiated high - grade spindle cell sarcoma , fnclcc g2 . with histological grading through the fnclcc classification , survival , by major correlation cell differentiation , mitotic rate , and percentage of necrosis are evaluated in a systematic score . since the 4 edition of the who classification of tumors of soft tissue and bone , there is a new category of tumors that can not be classified in earlier - defined categories . there were no signs of assist malfunction during icu stay . with atrial infiltration and major excision of healthy tissue , implantation of tah traditional bivad implantation as bridge - to - transplant as a short - term solution was not an option due to severe mitral valve stenosis from the atrial mass and mitral valve infiltration . the left atrial tumor was successfully removed . like bruckner et al . , we acknowledge that tah implantation as bridge - to - transplantation is surgically possible even with atrial wall involvement . surgical treatment is still the criterion standard for localized cardiac sarcomas , with various perioperative survival rates , ranging from 6 to 17 months . with complete resection of the tumor mass there is no valid data on the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy on malignant cardiac soft - tissue sarcomas . limitations of radiotherapy are cardiac sensitivity to radiation injury and adverse effects on global cardiac functions . our patient showed good recovery after initial gross resection in 2014 for 14 months without any adjuvant therapy . bleeding complications due to continuous anticoagulation for device functioning remains a major risk factor in circulatory assist device programs . in a study in 13 patients with tah , ramirez et al . found that bleeding complications occur generally between postoperative days 1 and 3 . patients with mechanical assist devices are prone to suffer from thrombotic events [ 1316 ] , device malfunctioning , wound infections , and bleeding complications . this intervention was the second attempt to help the patient with a long - term solution after first recurrence of an atrial tumor . the surgical options and possibilities were discussed at length with the patient and his family before the tah implantation . a multidisciplinary team and truthfully informed next of kin are hugely important when taking decisions in such a high - risk case .","backgroundtotal artificial heart ( tah ) implantation in patients with aggressive tumor infiltration of the heart can be challenging.case reportwe report on a patient with a rare primary undifferentiated high -

"liver diseases are common all over the world as well as in india ; and the prevalence of liver diseases is likely to increase in future . liver plays an important role in metabolism of thyroid and gonadal hormones like conjugation , excretion , peripheral deiodination , and synthesis of thyroid - binding globulin ( tbg ) and sex hormone - binding globulin ( shbg ) . hence , it is not surprising that thyroid and gonadal dysfunction have been reported in various spectra of liver diseases and associated with the severity of liver disease . these changes represent changes in biochemical abnormalities due to liver dysfunction and pathological changes associated with end organ damage . acute liver failure is associated with increased circulating endotoxins and proinflammatory mediators , which is quite similar to clinical state of sepsis and results in dysfunction of endocrinal glands like sick euthyroid syndrome also termed nonthyroidal illness syndrome ( ntis ) and hypogonadism . also in stable cirrhosis , a state of hypothyroidism has been shown which correlates with slow progression of stage of cirrhosis . we conducted this study at a tertiary care centre to assess thyroid and gonadal function in subjects with acute hepatitis ( ah ) , chronic liver disease ( cld ) , and post - lt . this study was conducted as a cross - sectional study at the army hospital ( research and referral ) , new delhi from may 2010 to dec 2011 . subjects with ah , cld , and lt were recruited from outpatient department and inpatient ward / intensive care unit of gastroenterology department . ah was diagnosed on the basis of presence of acute onset of jaundice with raised transaminases ( 3 ) , no past history of liver disease , and absence of evidence of portal hypertension on ultrasonography of abdomen . cld was diagnosed on the basis of evidence of liver disease of more than 6 months duration and/or evidence of portal hypertension on ultrasonography or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . these subjects were classified as per child - pugh criteria  child - pugh stage a ( cld-1 ) and child - pugh stage b or c ( cld-2 ) . patients on steroids or those who had received thyroid hormone or testosterone or had alcoholic liver disease were excluded from this study . this study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the declaration of helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects / patients were approved by the institutional human ethics committee at army hospital ( research and referral ) . written informed consent was obtained from all subjects / patients . patient 's fasting blood samples were collected and analyzed for hematological parameters ( complete blood count with platelet counts ) , liver function tests [ serum bilirubin , aspartate transaminases ( ast ) , alanine transaminases , serum protein , serum albumin , and international normalized ratio ( inr ) ] ; blood glucose , serum creatinine , serum lipid profile , and electrolytes ( serum sodium and potassium ) . patient 's blood was collected in fasting state and serum was separated and stored at 80c . hormone levels were measured using commercial kit provided by bhabha atomic research centre , mumbai ; and immunotech , beckman coulter company , france . primary and subclinical hypothyroidism were defined as low free thyroxin ( ft4 ) ( normal 0.8 - 2.1 ng / ml ) with raised thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) ( normal 0.5 - 6.5 iu / ml ) and normal ft4 with raised tsh , respectively . gonadal failure was defined as primary when luteinizing hormone ( lh ) , and follicular - stimulating hormone ( fsh ) were twice the upper limits of normal ( > 30 iu / l and > 40 iu / l , respectively ) or secondary when lh and fsh were low associated with low testosterone ( te ) levels in males ( te < 3.0 ng / ml ) or amenorrhea in females . data were presented as mean  standard deviation or number ( % ) unless specified . all parametric data were analyzed by independent student 's t - test in categorical groups ( two groups ) and analysis of variance test ( > two groups ) . pearson 's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the strength of relationship between thyroid and gonadal functions and other parameters . patient 's fasting blood samples were collected and analyzed for hematological parameters ( complete blood count with platelet counts ) , liver function tests [ serum bilirubin , aspartate transaminases ( ast ) , alanine transaminases , serum protein , serum albumin , and international normalized ratio ( inr ) ] ; blood glucose , serum creatinine , serum lipid profile , and electrolytes ( serum sodium and potassium ) . patient 's blood was collected in fasting state and serum was separated and stored at 80c . hormone levels were measured using commercial kit provided by bhabha atomic research centre , mumbai ; and immunotech , beckman coulter company , france . primary and subclinical hypothyroidism were defined as low free thyroxin ( ft4 ) ( normal 0.8 - 2.1 ng / ml ) with raised thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) ( normal 0.5 - 6.5 iu / ml ) and normal ft4 with raised tsh , respectively . gonadal failure was defined as primary when luteinizing hormone ( lh ) , and follicular - stimulating hormone ( fsh ) were twice the upper limits of normal ( > 30 iu / l and > 40 iu / l , respectively ) or secondary when lh and fsh were low associated with low testosterone ( te ) levels in males ( te < 3.0 ng / ml ) or amenorrhea in females . data were presented as mean  standard deviation or number ( % ) unless specified . all parametric data were analyzed by independent student 's t - test in categorical groups ( two groups ) and analysis of variance test ( > two groups ) . pearson 's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the strength of relationship between thyroid and gonadal functions and other parameters . in this study , we studied 25 patients of ah ; 20 patients of cld with relatively preserved liver functions ( cld1 ) which included child - pugh stage a and 30 patients with more advanced cld2 which included child - pugh stage b or c , and 10 patients who were post - lt . most of the subjects with ah were acute viral hepatitis ( n = 18 ) ; however , etiology could not be assessed in all cases . four of these patients with ah had acute liver failure . among 50 subjects with cld , 29 were hepatitis b virus ( hbv)-related cirrhosis , 8 were hepatitis c virus ( hcv)-related cirrhosis , 3 had hbv and hcv coinfection , and 10 had cryptogenic cirrhosis with probable autoimmune etiology in six . the indications for lts were hbv related cirrhosis in 5 patients , cryptogenic cirrhosis in 3 patients , and hcv - related cirrhosis in 2 patients . basic parameters of various groups thyroid dysfunction was present in 16% ( 14/75 ) patients with liver diseases . among thyroid dysfunction , the commonest was ntis 8% ( 6/75 ) , which was present in four patients of ah ( all with acute hepatic failure ) and two patients of cld-2 . subclinical hypothyroidism and primary hypothyroidism were present in three patients and one patient in cld group , respectively . thyroid function test were evaluated after excluding three patients with overt hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis . among patients with lt and ah group , cld-2 group had significantly lower levels of all thyroid hormones compared with controls and cld-1 group . thyroid and gonadal hormones in subjects with liver diseases compared with controls hypogonadism was present in 40% ( 30/74 ) patients with liver diseases excluding a postmenopausal woman . hypogonadism was commonest in patients with cld-2 ( 16/30 ; 53% ) , followed by lt ( 4/10 ; 40% ) , ah ( 6/25 ; 24% ) , and cld-1 ( 4/20 ; 20% ) . all the patients had secondary hypogonadism . among patients with ah , four patients with acute liver failure had low testosterone and low lh ( < 5 the consistent abnormality detected was significantly lower testosterone levels in all groups with liver disease compared with controls . serum estradiol levels were higher in all groups compared with controls , but were statistically significant only in ah and cld1 group [ table 2 ] . hypogonadism was predicted by older age , lower levels of serum albumin , total cholesterol and triglycerides and higher levels of plasma glucose , serum bilirubin , ast and inr [ table 3 ] . thyroid dysfunction was present in 16% ( 14/75 ) patients with liver diseases . among thyroid dysfunction , the commonest was ntis 8% ( 6/75 ) , which was present in four patients of ah ( all with acute hepatic failure ) and two patients of cld-2 . subclinical hypothyroidism and primary hypothyroidism were present in three patients and one patient in cld group , respectively . thyroid function test were evaluated after excluding three patients with overt hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis . among patients with lt and ah group , cld-2 group had significantly lower levels of all thyroid hormones compared with controls and cld-1 group . hypogonadism was present in 40% ( 30/74 ) patients with liver diseases excluding a postmenopausal woman . hypogonadism was commonest in patients with cld-2 ( 16/30 ; 53% ) , followed by lt ( 4/10 ; 40% ) , ah ( 6/25 ; 24% ) , and cld-1 ( 4/20 ; 20% ) . all the patients had secondary hypogonadism . among patients with ah , four patients with acute liver failure had low testosterone and low lh ( < 5 the consistent abnormality detected was significantly lower testosterone levels in all groups with liver disease compared with controls . serum estradiol levels were higher in all groups compared with controls , but were statistically significant only in ah and cld1 group [ table 2 ] . hypogonadism was predicted by older age , lower levels of serum albumin , total cholesterol and triglycerides and higher levels of plasma glucose , serum bilirubin , ast and inr [ table 3 ] . clinical and biochemical predictors of hypogonadism in patients with chronic liver disease endocrine dysfunction are common with liver diseases , which is correlated with severity of liver dysfunction and improve after lt . in this study , we have assessed thyroid and gonadal functions in complete spectrum of severity of liver diseases and after lt . in present study , ntis was the commonest , was present in patients with acute liver failure and cld . ntis is characterized by a normal total t4 , normal / high free t4 , low total t3 , low free t3 , and an elevated rt3 . among patients with cld , cases with primary hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis were observed . cld due autoimmune etiology is known to have associated autoimmune thyroid disease . in autoimmune hepatitis , both grave 's disease ( 6% ) and autoimmune hypothyroidism ( 12% ) are common . subclinical hypothyroidism has been reported in patients with hepatitis - c related cld , which has been attributed to direct cytopathic effect of hepatitis - c virus on thyroid cells , underlying latent autoimmune disease , and treatment related . serum total t3 was lower in all forms of liver disease when compared with controls . this was due to decreased hepatic uptake and type-1 deiodinase activity ( d1 ) , which converts t4 to t3 . liver disease is also associated with increase in inflammatory cytokines that negatively affect hypothalamothyroid axis , which may explain lower tsh levels ( statistically not significant ) observed in patients with liver disease as compared to controls in this study . other studies have reported higher levels of tsh in clds , but these studies have not excluded patients with overt thyroid dysfunction , which we have excluded in this study before analysis . serum total t3 was lower in ah and cld-2 compared with cld-1 in this study , reflecting associated severity of liver disease . most consistent abnormality of thyroid functions reported is lower total and free ft3 and increase in rt3 in patients with cirrhosis of liver . the plasma t3:rt3 ratio has a negative correlation with the severity of cirrhosis . in present study thyroid hormone is associated with basal metabolic rate , and low total and free t3 levels may reflect adaptive hypothyroid state . this will reduce the basal metabolic rate and may help to preserve hepatocytes and liver function . occurrence of hypothyroidism in cirrhotic patients has been shown to be associated with a biochemical improvement in liver function , and decreased rate of decompensation in cirrhosis . total and free t4 was increased in cld-1 but decreased significantly in patients with cld-2 . increase in total t4 has been observed in patients with acute and cld due to increase in tbg levels , which is synthesized as acute phase reactant . patients with liver diseases have increased low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) and lower high - density lipoproteins hdl , which improves after lt . thyroid hormones increase the expression of ldl receptors on the hepatocytes and increase the activity of lipid - lowering liver enzymes , resulting in a reduction in low - density lipoprotein levels . thyroid hormones also increase the expression of apolipoprotein a1 , a major component of high - density lipoprotein . hence , decrease in thyroid hormones associated with liver disease will adversely affect ldl disposal and decrease hdl synthesis . in this study , it was commonest with cld with child pugh stage b and c , and after lt . serum total testosterone decreased progressively from acute liver disease to cld and correlated with the increasing severity of liver disease . serum lh levels were significantly lower in patients with cld-1 but were comparable in other groups as was the fsh . another study reported higher level of lh in patients with cirrhosis of liver but lower lh response to gonadotropin - releasing hormone indicating involvement of hypothalamo - pituitary - gonadal axis at all levels . there was no difference in fsh level among patients and controls . a study assessed pulsatile pattern of lh in patients with cld and found attenuated pattern of lh secretion , indicating hypothalamic dysfunction . on the contrary , few studies have suggested primary gonadal failure with compensatory in lh in patients with cld . alcohol is known to affect gonadal functions , which were not included in this study . a study similar to ours , also noticed reduced levels of total and free testosterone and increased levels of shbg compared with controls with normal liver function in men with chronic nonalcoholic liver disease , which was related with severity of liver disease . in the present study , serum testosterone levels were higher in patients after lt , but remained lower than controls . handelsman et al . , also reported gradual improvement in serum testosterone levels over 12 months post - lt , but levels remained subnormal . there was no change in lh and fsh after transplantation in this study . however , one study reported increase in gonadotropins and testosterone , and decrease in estradiol levels after transplantation . this was probably due to more severe gonadal dysfunction in their study , as 90% of patients had hypogonadism . in the present study , serum estradiol levels were higher in all patients with liver disease compared with controls , which was similar to observed by others . mao et al . , observed that serum estradiol levels were correlated with severity of liver disease and deteriorating liver functions in males with hbv - related liver disease . the strengths of this study are the assessment of thyroid and gonadal functions at various stages of liver disease and exclusion of patients with alcoholic liver disease because alcohol is known to affect hypothalamo - gonadal axis . in the present study , most of the patients were stable and not critically ill except four patients with hepatic failure , leading to lesser confounding factors in thyroid and gonadal dysfunction . first , we have not measured free testosterone , tbg , and shbg due to financial constraints . second , pituitary response to trh and gnrh was not assessed , which could have highlighted underlying mechanism . third , as this was a cross - sectional study , we could not assess factors which could have predicted mortality or morbidity . in conclusion ,","introduction : liver is involved with the synthesis of carrier proteins and metabolism of various hormones and liver diseases may , therefore , be associated with various endocrine disturbances . 
 this study was conducted to assess thyroid and gonadal function in subjects with acute hepatitis ( ah ) , chronic liver disease ( cld ) , and those who had undergone liver transplantation ( lt).materials and methods : patients with ah , cld with child - pugh stage a ( cld-1 ) and child - pugh stage b or c ( cld-2 ) , and lt seen at our tertiary level hospital were assessed clinically , biochemically , and for thyroid and gonadal functions besides 25 healthy controls.results:thyroid dysfunction and hypogonadism were present in 14 ( 16% ) and 24 ( 28% ) patients with liver diseases respectively . among thyroid dysfunction , 
 the commonest was sick euthyroid syndrome six ( 7% ) , followed by subclinical hypothyroidism in three patients ( 3.5% ) , subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis in two patients each ( 2.3% ) and overt hypothyroidism in one patient . among patients with lt and ah groups , 
 the only abnormality was significantly lower total t3 compared with healthy controls . 
 the cld2 group had significantly lower levels of all thyroid hormones compared with controls and cld1 group . 
 hypogonadism was commonest in patients with cld-2 ( 14 ; 50% ) followed by lt ( 3 ; 33% ) , cld-1 ( 4 ; 20% ) , and ah ( 3 ; 14% ) . 
 hypogonadism was predicted by older age , lower levels of serum albumin , total cholesterol , and triglycerides and higher levels of plasma glucose , serum bilirubin , aspartate transaminases , and international normalized ratio . 
 gonadal functions showed recovery following lt.conclusions:thyroid dysfunction and hypogonadism form an important part of the spectrum of acute and cld , and patients with lt . 
 deterioration of synthetic functions of liver disease predicts presence of hypogonadism .",447
"rickettsia are obligatory , intracellular , small gram - negative bacteria associated with eukaryotic hosts . they are traditionally divided into three groups : the spotted fever group , the typhus group and the scrub typhus group . the spotted fever results from a large group of tick- , mite- and flea - borne zoonotic infections that are caused by closely related rickettsiae . rickettsia conorii has been identified as the agent causing mediterranean spotted fever ( msf ) . a variety of geographically distinct types of r. conorii have been described that cause variable clinical presentations different from typical msf . a 27-year - old primigravida with a 16week history of amenorrhea and respiratory failure was transfered to a tertiary care center . she had high - grade fever for 8 days prior to the transfer and had developed an erythymatous maculopapular rash on day 4 of the illness , involving the trunk initially , later extending to the palms and soles [ figure 1 ] . erythematous maculopapular rash in a hand a persistant dry cough , not associated with hemoptysis , was noticed on day 5 . she developed a progressively worsening dyspnea with bilateral ankle edema not associated with oliguria or orthopnea . her condition deteriorated rapidly , warranting intubation for respiratory failure and transfer to a tertiary care center . on admission to the tertiary care center icu , the patient also had tachycardia ( 128 beats / min ) without any significant st segment changes on the ecg . the blood urea measured 8.7 mmol / dl with a serum sodium of 140 meq / l and a pottasium of 5.0 meq / l . full blood count showed neutrophilia of 78% in a total of 14.4  10 l. hemoglobin was 7.4 g / dl with a mild thrombocytopenia of 160,000 l . the blood picture revealed normochromic normocytic anemia with no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) . the international normalized ratio ( inr ) was 0.96 . the serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( sgot ) activity was 42 u / l and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( sgpt ) activity was 28 the c - reactive protein ( crp ) level was 6 mg / dl and the antinuclear antibody ( ana ) was negative . chest x - ray on day 1 at icu , showing diffuse bilateral opacities the patient was started on oral azithromycin , iv cefotaxime , iv hydrocortisone 50 mg 6 hourly . the patient 's condition deteriorated rapidly on day 3 of icu stay and needed adrenaline , noradrenaline , dobutamine and vasopressin to maintain a blood pressure of 70/50 mmhg . the urine output dropped and the urine microscopic examination revealed granular casts and dysmorphic red blood cells . blood urea rose to 12.9 mmol / dl and the electrolytes showed pottasium level of 5.6 meq / l . on the 4 day at the icu and 12 day of the disease , she devoloped anuria with further increase in blood urea and serum creatinine . she was hemodynamically unstable with a blood pressure of 60 mmhg even with total inotrope support . endocardium of the heart showed vegitations on a narrowed mitral valve [ figure 4 ] . the kidneys were of normal size , but the cortico - medullary demarcations were less clear . the grossly hemorrhagic lung the heart showing narrowing and vegetations at the mitral valve the histology of the lung showed gross hemorrhage and foci of pneumonia . the vegetations of the heart were reported as fibrinous with entrapped white cells , but with no bacteria or fungi . histology of the liver revealed centrilobular necrosis with a tendency to confluence , and a mild fatty change . a final diagnosis of disseminated r. conorii infection with pulmonary hemorrhage , endocarditis and tubulointerstitial nephritis was made . r. conorii is an obligate , intracellular , slow - growing , gram - negative bacterium belonging to the spotted fever group of rickettsiae . unusual rickettsial strains related to r. conorii have been described as belonging to an  r. conorii complex  which includes the indian tick typhus rickettsia ( atcc vr-597 ) with r. conorii subsp . it is transmitted to humans through the bite of dog ticks ( rhipicephalus sanguineus ) widely prevalent among the  old world  . it is also known to be transmitted by haemaphysalis ticks , especially in pakistan and kenya . the infection is transmitted via larvae and nymphs , and the tick bite is usually not felt . the incubation period ranges from 3 to 15 days depending upon the route of rickettsial entry and the rickettsial load . after introduction into the skin at the site of the tick bite or through the conjunctiva contaminated by blood or excretions from an infective tick , the primary multiplication occurs . in the skin , the localized multiplication of the rickettsiae in the endothelial cells of the capillaries leads to the formation of a raised red papule . the inflammation and thrombosis of the affected capillaries lead to necrosis of the center of the papule and the formation of the typical red lesion with a black center , the  tache noire  . this is followed by the spread of infection through lympho - hematogenous routes throughout the body , causing disseminated vascular lesions in multiple organs . about 6% of the cases are severe , and fatal cases occur even in young , healthy adults , with a reported death rate of about 2.5% . old age , alcoholism and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) deficiency are known risk factors for severe disease . the patient described here is from kotagla , a tea estate village in central sri lanka . the patient reported a history of significant exposure to stray dogs , abundant in any sri lankan village , but not of any tick bites . the absence of the tachy noire is significant in this case as the clinical diagnosis of msf ( caused by r. conorii subsp . however , the absence of tache noire has been noted in israeli spotted fever caused by r. conorii subsp . the fever starts after an incubation period of 7 days followed by a febrile period ( up to 40c , usually continuous ) associated with a maculopapular rash . the papules of the rash are first noticed on the 3 to 5 day of illness , and they come out in crops and are palpable as small nodules in the skin . in severe cases , characteristically , the rash involves the palms of the hands , the soles of the feet and , to a lesser extent , the face . in this patient , the rash involved the palms and soles , sparing the face , and was of dusky cyanotic appearence with prominant macules . the cough and the dyspnea reported in our patient were relatively rare in a case series of msf , with a representation of 10% and 21% , respectively . renal insufficiency is a known complication in around 6% of the patients and is caused by tubulointerstitial nephritis . myocarditis had been obseved in 11% of patients and might explain the severe tachycardia with poor response to inotropes in this patient . the diagnosis of r. conorii infection in this patient is justfied as there is a compatible clinical picture along with a single titer of > 1/512 . endocarditis is not described as a complication of r. conorii infection . identifying r. conorii as the causative organism of endocarditis in this patient is supported by the absence of previous heart disease and lack of clinical features to suggest subacute bacterial endocarditis on admission and during prenatal clinics . the vegetations isolated from this patient as well as the blood cultures did not reveal bacteria or fungi . this patient was correctly started on oral azithromicin and intravenous chlorampenicol at the tertiary hospital . a diagnostic scoring system with microbiological , epidemiologic , and clinical parameters has been proposed for msf and it had shown good sensitivity and specificity . this case highlights the need of clinical suspicion of uncommon diseases based on the geographic and socioeconomic background of a patient . relatively benign diseases may have severe manifestations resulting in fatality ; therefore , physicians should consider there factors for early diagnosis and intervention .","rickettsial diseases are common in srilanka . 
 the spotted fever group of rickettsiae presents in many ways , including very severe disease causing significant morbidity and mortality . a regional variation of the rickettsia conorii subspecies and differences in clinical presentations 
 are reported . 
 this case describes disseminated rickettsia conorii infection in a pregnant woman presenting with endocarditis .",84
"cell metabolism governing the growth and functioning of each cell and a whole organism refers to chemical transformations and enzyme - catalyzed energy producing and energy utilizing reactions of carbohydrates , proteins , and lipids . amongst the most metabolically active organs are liver , brain , gut , kidneys , and heart [ 13 ] . although the rate of metabolic reactions is lower in skeletal muscles , they account for around 20% of the total energy expenditure due to a 5060% contribution to a total body mass . several micrornas were reported to control processes related to metabolism such as insulin secretion ( mir-9 , mir-375 ) , adipocyte differentiation ( mir-143 ) , fatty acid metabolism ( mir-122 ) , and myogenesis ( mir-1 , mir-133a , mir-133b , and mir-206 ) ( reviewed in ) . of potential meaning is also mir-378a , located in the gene encoding master metabolic regulator , peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma , coactivator 1 beta ( pgc-1 ) . mir-378a was found to affect lipid and xenobiotic metabolism , lipid storage , mitochondrial function , and shift towards a glycolytic pathway ( warburg effect ) [ 5 , 6 ] . because nutrients supply for metabolic processes is a matter of circulation , metabolically active tissues require high vascular density . recently , mir-378a was reported to regulate tumor angiogenesis mainly via inhibition of tumor suppressors sufu and fus-1 [ 8 , 9 ] . thus , a growing body of evidence suggests a role of mir-378a as a mediator controlling reciprocally dependent processes such as metabolism , muscle differentiation / regeneration , and angiogenesis . micrornas ( mirnas ; mirs ) are small noncoding rna molecules with an average length of 21 - 22 nucleotides which can regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by targeting mostly the 3untranslated region ( 3utr ) of mrnas . however , mirna target sites were also found on the 5utr regions of human mrna . since their discovery in c. elegans in 1993 , mirnas currently can be recognized as potent players in wide spectrum of biological processes like development , differentiation , cellular defense mechanisms , and others . conservative estimates state that over 30% of mrna expression is regulated by mirnas [ 12 , 13 ] . however , others suggest that even up to 60% of the mrna expression is targeted by mirnas . mirnas are often located in the introns of coding genes or noncoding sequences but can also be located in exons . intronic mirnas can be expressed together with their host gene mrna being derived from a common rna transcript [ 15 , 16 ] . other mirnas can also have their own promoters , which enable independent expression , or can be organized in clusters sharing a common transcriptional regulation [ 17 , 18 ] . mirnas transcription is rna polymerase ii - dependent . in the case of mirnas that are encoded in their own genes , the primary mirna transcript ( pri - mirna ) is several kilobases long , while mirnas encoded in intronic regions of other genes ( mirtrons ) have shorter transcripts . the mirna stem loop is excised from pri - mirna by endoribonuclease drosha / dgcr8 ( microprocessor complex ) and a hairpin called pre - mirna is exported from the nucleus by exportin-5 in a ran - gtp dependent manner . an endoribonuclease dicer removes the hairpin loop sequence from pre - mirna , creating a double stranded mirna duplex . depending on the relative stability of the mirna duplex , one or , more rarely , both strands can be incorporated in a multiprotein rna - induced silencing complex ( risc ) . when there is perfect pairing between the mirna sequence and its target site , mrna is cleaved by a protein part of the risc called argonaute ( ago ) . if the pairing is partial , deadenylation of the mrna via recruitment of the ccr4-not complex by the gw182 proteins inside the risc takes place and the poly - a tail is lost , leaving the mrna vulnerable to rnase activity , ubiquitination , and mrna degradation . alternatively , mirna - induced risc can also cause repression of translation by mechanisms such as , for example , the promotion of ribosome drop - off from the mrna transcript or destabilization of the mrna binding cap protein ( figure 1 ) ( reviewed in [ 20 , 21 ] ) . the pre - mir gives rise to a leading strand ( mir-378a-3p , previous ids for murine sequence : mmu - mir-422b , mmu - mir-378 , and mmu - mir-378 - 3p ; for human : hsa - mir-422b and hsa - mir-378 ) and a passenger strand ( mir-378a-5p , previous ids for murine sequence : mmu - mir-378 , mmu - mir-378 , and mmu - mir-378 - 5p ; for human : hsa - mir-378 and hsa - mir-378 ) . mirna-378a-3p mature strand was first identified in 2004 in humans ( originally named mir-422b ) . recently , other mirs with similar sequences but other localizations in the genome have been discovered and named : mmu - mir-378b , c , d in mouse and hsa - mir-378-b , c , d1,d2,e , f , g , h , i , j in human [ 2327 ] ( table 1 ) . in humans , mir-378a is by far the most expressed of the mir-378 sequences , with 7030 reads per million , in 78 experiments during deep sequencing , compared with 1013220 reads per million , in 4272 experiments for the other forms , respectively . in mice , mir-378a and mir-378b have similar expression levels , at 11700 and 11000 reads per million ( mirbase , version 21 , september 2015 ) . the sequence of mir-378a mature strands is highly conserved between species , with the mir-378a-5p strand being identical in both human and mice and the mir-378a-3p strand only differing in one nucleotide ( table 2 ) [ 6 , 27 ] . pgc-1 may regulate several facets of energy metabolism such as mitochondrial biogenesis , thermogenesis , and glucose and fatty acid metabolism . both strands of mir-378a are coexpressed with pgc-1 as shown , for example , in the liver and during adipocyte differentiation [ 6 , 29 ] . the coexpression of mir-378a with its host gene implies they may share the same transcriptional activators , and mir-378a might be involved in similar processes as pgc-1. accordingly , high levels of ( porcine ) mir-378 - 1 ( table 2 ) expression are found in developing muscle , postnatal muscle , and myocardium and in brown adipose tissue [ 29 , 30 ] . to date , only a limited number of mir-378a targets , which can be predicted based on in silico analysis , have been experimentally validated . the latter , however , imply a role of mir-378a in mitochondrial energy homeostasis , glycolysis , and skeletal muscle development and in tumor angiogenesis and other processes ( table 3 ) . a major source of energy production comprises oxidation of glucose in glycolysis followed by oxidation of pyruvate in well - oxygenated cells ( or followed by lactic acid fermentation in cancer , the warburg effect ) and from -oxidation of lipids , which yields even more atp per gram then carbohydrates metabolism . a location of mir-378a in the gene encoding pgc-1   implies an involvement of mir-378a in metabolic pathways . unlike its homologue , pgc-1 , the expression of pgc-1 is not elevated in response to cold exposure   but occurs in response to hypoxia , exercise , caloric restriction , or aging ( reviewed in ) . pgc-1 is preferentially expressed in tissues with relatively high mitochondrial content , such as heart , skeletal muscle , and brown adipose tissue . in 2002 , pgc-1 was first cloned and shown to be upregulated in the liver during fasting . pgc-1 strongly activates hepatic nuclear factor 4 ( hnf4 ) and ppar , both of these nuclear receptors being important for the adaptation of hepatocytes to the effects of fasting . these findings could hint to a possible role of pgc-1 in the regulation of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in the liver . pgc-1 is also involved in the regulation of energy expenditure or in the pathway of estrogen receptor - related receptors ( errs ) [ 3337 ] . since mirnas originating in the introns of host genes may modulate the protein encoded by their parental genes and may be involved in the same mechanisms [ 3840 ] , mir-378a is proposed to be involved in the metabolic pathways affected by pgc-1 . it was reported that mice lacking the first intron of the ppargc1b gene ( and thus mir-378a ) have a significantly higher oxygen capacity and mitochondrial function . they identified a mediator complex subunit 13 ( med13 ) , involved in nuclear receptor signaling , and carnitine acetyltransferase ( crat ) , a mitochondrial enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism , as targets of mir-378a-5p and mir-378a-3p , respectively . regulated also cytochrome p450 2e1 ( cyp2e1 ) being involved in the metabolism of , for example , drugs and toxins . in addition , it has been discovered that transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor-1 ( nrf-1 ) , a critical regulator of the expression of some important metabolic genes in mitochondria regulating cellular growth , is inhibited by mir-378a-3p . thus , mir-378a can be considered as a regulator of mitochondrial function in cells overexpressing mir-378a . moreover , mir-378a-5p inhibits the mrnas of err and ga - binding protein- in breast cancer , which both interact with pgc-1 and together control oxidative metabolism . this leads to a reduction of tricarboxylic acid gene expression and oxygen consumption and an increase in lactate production , which shifts cells from an oxidative towards a glycolytic pathway . in this way , mir-378a-5p is believed to be a switch regulating the warburg effect in breast cancer . moreover , in situ hybridization experiments in this study showed that mir-378a-5p expression correlates with progression of breast cancer . the proposed regulating role of mir-378a-5p on the warburg effect is in parallel with the effects of pgc-1 , which mediates gluconeogenesis and fatty acid metabolism after periods of fasting or intense exercise . coactivation by pgc-1 of err and ppar makes muscle fibers in pgc-1 transgenic mice more rich in mitochondria and highly oxidative . accordingly increased glycolytic rates and increased cell proliferation can be related to lactate production by lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) . ldha was found to be a direct target of mir-378a in the study of mallat et al . . hsa - mir-378a-3p represses cell growth and increases cell death by targeting ldha . of note , hsa - mir-378a-3p and hsa - mir-378a-5p had opposite effects on ldha expression . in addition , mir-378a is also considered as an important factor in adipogenesis and lipid storage . there is a complex family of factors regulating those processes such as insulin , insulin - like growth factors ( igfs ) , glucagon , and thyroid hormones t3 and t4 ( reviewed in [ 4649 ] ) . as mentioned before , it was demonstrated that mir-378a - knockout mice do not get fat after 8 weeks of high fat diet . such animals show an enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism and have elevated oxidative capacity of tissues targeted by insulin ( e.g. , liver , muscles , and adipose tissues ) . in accordance with that , it was shown that mature strands of bta - mir-378 - 1 ( table 1 ) are expressed at higher level in cows with high ( versus low ) amount of back fat . similarly , an inhibition of both mmu - mir-378a-3p and its host gene , pgc-1 , by the flavonoid fisetin lowered the accumulation of fat in the liver . interestingly , mmu - mir-378a-5p was downregulated in mice that were fed a high fat diet for five months . overexpression of mir-378a-3p/-5p during adipogenesis increased the transcriptional activity of ccaat / enhancer - binding proteins ( cebp ) alpha and beta , which can stimulate the expression of leptin , a hormone produced mainly by adipocytes which controls the homeostasis of body weight   ( reviewed in [ 52 , 53 ] ) . on the other hand , tnf- , il-6 , and leptin are reported to increase the expression of mir-378a-3p in mature human adipocytes in vitro . these cytokines are mainly secreted in the adipose tissue and are suggested to be involved in development of insulin resistance [ 55 , 56 ] . in addition , mir-378a-3p was shown to target insulin growth factor 1 receptor ( igf1r ) and reduce the akt signaling cascade in cardiomyocytes during cardiac development . moreover , in tissues where igf1 levels were high ( e.g. , fibroblasts and fetal hearts ) , mir-378 - 3p levels were very low , showing an inverse relation and suggesting a negative feedback loop between mir-378a-3p , igf1r , and igf1 . the latter functions as a master regulator of adipogenesis and is involved in the formation of peroxisomes and the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids [ 58 , 59 ] . accordingly , the amount of adipose tissue does not increase in mice lacking ppar when they are fed a high fat diet . it was also reported that in cultured adipocytes mmu - mir-378a and pgc-1 expression is ppar , or rosiglitazone ( a ppar ligand ) , dependent , finding two peroxisome proliferator response elements in the mir-378a loci . on the other hand , overexpression of mir-378a elevated the expression of ppar isoform 2 , suggesting positive feedback loop and confirming the involvement of mir-378a in the storage of fat . there are several activators known to induce expression of ppar such as the members of the e2f transcription factor family and prostaglandin j-2 ( pgj-2 ) [ 6365 ] . the latter may act through rar - related orphan receptor alpha ( rora ) , which is frequently found in myocardium . in addition to ppar , rora regulates also myod , a major transcription factor involved in skeletal muscle differentiation [ 67 , 68 ] . interestingly , rora is a possible ( but not yet validated ) target for mir-378a-3p . a proteomics - based study revealed several other proteins that are potentially targeted by rat mir-378a-3p or mir-378a-5p . mir-378a-3p was shown to regulate mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase ( gdp ) , dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 ( ddah1 ) , and lactate dehydrogenase a ( ldha ) ; all those proteins are participating in metabolic processes . on the other hand , tropomyosin beta chain , which is involved in the regulation of atpase activity , high levels of murine and rat mir-378a-3p , mir-378a-5p , and porcine mir-378 - 1 are reported in both developing and adult skeletal muscles [ 7 , 30 , 44 ] . myod and myog play a role in the processes of myogenesis and muscle regeneration , in which dormant satellite cells are activated upon muscle damage and start proliferating and differentiating into muscle fibers ( reviewed in [ 70 , 71 ] ) . it has been shown that mir-378a-3p targets the myogenic repressor myor during myoblast differentiation , which directly inhibits myod . on the other hand , myod is upregulated in response to mir-378a-3p overexpression and , conversely , the level of mir-378a-3p may be enhanced by myod . thus , there is evidence for a feedback loop in which mir-378a-3p regulates muscle differentiation via inhibiting myor , leading to an increase of myod , which in turn enhances mir-378a-3p . that mir-378a may also control the development of skeletal muscle mass after training . in this study , mir-378a ( strand not specified ) was significantly downregulated in men who obtained low training - induced muscle mass gain compared to men who obtained high training - induced muscle mass gain . mir-378a-3p is expressed mostly by cardiomyocytes , but not by nonmuscle cells , whereas the level of mir-378a-5p was reported to be very low in the heart . fang et al . showed that mir-378 - 3p is significantly downregulated both in vitro in cardiomyocytes cell cultures exposed to hypoxia and in vivo during myocardial injury in rats . overexpression of mir-378a-3p enhanced cell viability and inhibited apoptosis via caspase-3 inhibition . in contrast to this finding , another study found that mir-378a-3p downregulation enhanced the survival of cardiac stem cells via focal adhesion kinase activation and releasing connective tissue growth factor ( ctgf ) , the latter being a target of mir-378a-3p . overexpression of mir-378a-3p in the study of knezevic et al . increased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes via the direct targeting of igf1r leading to a decrease of akt signaling . this is in opposition to the previously mentioned study of fang et al . which showed apoptosis the converse findings of the studies could be explained by different models used by knezevic et al . and because of those discrepancies , the role of mir-378a in apoptosis of cardiomyocytes requires further investigation . the finding that mir-378a-3p affects both igf1r and the akt pathway was confirmed   in a study which found that overexpression of mir-378a-3p in rhabdomyosarcoma suppressed igf1r expression and affected phosphorylation of the akt protein . mir-378a-5p was shown to target heat shock protein 70.3 ( hsp70.3 ) in mouse hearts in normoxic conditions , but in hypoxic conditions a transcript variant of hsp70.3 without mir-378a-5p target site in its 3-utr is not repressed and can exert its cytoprotective properties . mir-378a-3p prevented cardiac hypertrophy by targeting either ras signaling or the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway [ 77 , 78 ] . more studies on the effect of mir-378a expression in muscle disorders would also be desirable . in both golden retriever muscular dystrophy dogs and duchenne muscular dystrophy patients , all in all , these findings suggest mir-378a-3p can be considered as an important player in cardiac development , remodeling , and hypertrophy . angiogenesis comprises development of new blood vessels from existing ones , regulated by cytokines and growth factors such as , for example , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) , and angiopoietin-1 ( ang-1 ) . their expression can be posttranscriptionally controlled by micrornas such as mir-126 , mir-296 , mir-210 , mir-21 , and the mir-17~92 cluster   ( reviewed in ) . skeletal muscles and heart muscle are tissues which , due to their oxygen and energy consumption , need to be sufficiently vascularized . one of the major regulators of angiogenesis is the hypoxia - inducible factor-1 ( hif-1 ) , which controls over 100 genes   involved mainly in the glycolytic pathway and blood vessel formation , including vegf - a or interleukin-8 [ 8385 ] . vegf is generally induced by hypoxia , while il-8 in at least some cancers and endothelial cells can be diminished by hif-1 via inhibition of c - myc and sp-1 transcription factors [ 86 , 87 ] . c - myc , known as a regulator of cell cycle progression , apoptosis , and cellular transformation , is also a potent activator of pgc-1 and , in turn , mir-378a-3p , upregulating their expression . in addition , mir-378a has been shown to affect vegf - a in two ways . human hsa - mir-378a-5p ( by the study of hua et al . named as mir-378 ) can directly affect vegf - a by competing with hsa - mir-125a for the same seed - region in the vegf - a 3utr causing upregulation of vegf - a . mir-378a-5p can also indirectly regulate vegf - a affecting sonic hedgehog ( shh ) signaling via sufu inhibition , which is an inhibitory component of this signaling pathway . the shh pathway in turn can upregulate vegf - a and also other regulators of blood vessels formation , ang-1 and ang-2 expression [ 9092 ] . increased expression of vegf - a , as well as pdgf and tgf1 , was also seen in mesenchymal stromal cells ( mscs ) transfected with rno - mir-378a-5p . in skeletal muscles , vegf - induced angiogenesis appears not to be regulated by the well - known hif pathway but by pgc-1 , which coactivates estrogen - related receptor alpha ( err- ) on binding sites in the promoter and the first intron of the vegf gene , inducing its expression . this angiogenic pathway shows new roles for pgc-1 and err- , which are important regulators of mitochondrial activity in response to stimuli like exercise . if there might be a role for pgc-1 in this pathway , it is yet to be examined . it is noteworthy , however , that mir-378a-5p is known to affect the estrogen receptors by inhibiting err , another estrogen - related receptor . a role for mir-378a in cell cycle regulation and stimulation of cell growth is also proposed . in human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cell lines , mir-378a-3p can target the antiproliferative protein tob2 , which is a suppressor of cyclin d1 , which in turn is required for cell cycle g1-phase to s - phase progression . whether mir-378 affects endothelial cell proliferation by regulation of cell cycle remains to be established . the role of mir-378a in the formation of blood vessels nourishing tumor and enabling tumor growth was revealed . mir-378a was found to be differentially regulated in different types of cancers   being downregulated in gastric cancer [ 96 , 97 ] , oral , and colon carcinoma , while being upregulated in renal   and lung cancer [ 9 , 101 ] . since it is also changed in serum or plasma of patients with prostate cancer , renal cancer [ 100 , 103 ] , and gastric cancer   and frequently found to be overexpressed in cryopreserved bone marrow mononuclear cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients , mir-378a might be considered as a biomarker . the role of mir-378a in tumorigenesis , tumor growth , and tumor vascularization was revealed for the first time by lee and coworkers in glioblastoma . they showed that mir-378a-5p enhances cell survival , reduces caspase-3 activity , and promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis , through repression of two tumor suppressors , sufu and fus-1 . strikingly , nude mice injected with mir-378a-5p transfected cancer cells formed tumors of bigger volume and with larger blood vessels compared to gfp - transfected cells . on the other hand , high expression of mir-378a-5p in nsclc correlated with brain metastases due to higher cell migration , invasion , and tumor angiogenesis . another study confirmed the downregulation of fus-1 by mir-378a-5p and showed that in the hepg2 liver cancer cells mir-378a-5p overexpression enhanced proliferation , migration , and , when injected in mice , invasion . also in rhabdomyosarcoma , enhanced expression of mir-378a , vegf , and mmp9 correlated with increased vascularization and metastasis . taken together , these studies suggest that mir-378a may serve as a prognostic marker in cancer due to its effects on angiogenesis . our recent data confirmed the proangiogenic effect of mir-378a ( both strands ) in non - small cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc ) and pointed at its correlation with heme - degrading enzyme , heme oxygenase-1 ( ho-1 ) . an involvement of ho-1 in angiogenesis and vegf - a as well as il-8 signaling was shown by us previously ; however , its action in tumors seems to be complex . in nci - h292 cell line overexpressing ho-1 , mir-378a ( both strands ) also overexpression of the mir-378a precursor sequence diminished ho-1 expression . conditioned medium from nci - h292 cells overexpressing mir-378a enhanced angiogenic potential of hmec-1 endothelial cell line . tumors formed by such cells in subcutaneous xenografts showed enhanced growth , vascularization , oxygenation , and distal metastasis in vivo . these interactions between mir-378a and ho-1 were confirmed in our studies on the role of the nrf-2 transcription factor / ho-1 axis in nsclc cell lines [ 110 , 111 ] . on the other hand , enhanced expression of mmu - mir-378a-5p in 4t1 murine breast cancer cells decreased the proliferation , migration , and invasiveness of these cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting fibronectin , resulting in inhibition of tumor growth . recent study showed that mir-378a may act as a biomarker for response to antiangiogenic treatment in ovarian cancer . low expression of mir-378a was associated with longer progressive - free survival in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab . overexpression of the mir-378a precursor in ovarian cancer cells altered expression of genes associated with angiogenesis ( alcam , ehd1 , elk3 , and tln1 ) , apoptosis ( rpn2 , hipk3 ) , and cell cycle regulation ( swap-70 , lsm14a , and rdx ) . high mir-378a ( strand not specified ) expression in renal carcinoma correlated with higher levels of endothelial surface marker cd34 in these tumors . notably , a recent study suggested clinical relevance for mir-378a in metastatic colorectal cancer , in which enhanced mir-378a expression significantly improved the sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in these patients . mir-378a-5p transfection of mscs has been shown to enhance their survival and angiogenic potential under hypoxic conditions in vitro . in coculture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) , mir-378a-5p - transfected mscs formed a larger number of vascular branches on matrigel . in the mscs transfected with mir-378a-5p , the expression of bcl-2-associated x protein ( bax ) , which is an important proapoptotic regulator , was decreased , leading to a better survival . it still has to be determined if the proangiogenic effect of mir-378a in vivo is confined to tumor angiogenesis , or if this effect is also present in physiological angiogenesis and regenerative neovascularization . recently , it was reported that anti - mir-378a-5p enhances wound healing process by upregulating integrin beta-3 and vimentin . it was reported that pgc-1 induces angiogenesis in skeletal muscle , enhancing the expression of vegf both in vitro and in vivo after ( transgenic ) overexpression . accordingly , it was also found that vegfa is upregulated in c2c12 myoblast cell line with pgc-1 overexpression . however , after a pcr - based gene array of 84 known angiogenic factors and further rt - pcr of individual genes , they concluded that pgc-1 triggered an antiangiogenic program . after inducing hind limb ischemia in pgc-1 overexpressing mice , an impaired reperfusion was noticed when compared to wild type littermates . the role of inflammation in angiogenesis is studied the most in the context of cancer ( e.g. , reviewed in [ 119 , 120 ] ) but is certainly not limited to this pathology . both lymphoid ( reviewed in [ 121 , 122 ] ) and myeloid ( reviewed in ) derived inflammatory cells affect angiogenesis in a stimulating or inhibitory manner . the role of mir-378a in inflammatory cells was reported and its anti - inflammatory effect could be suggested . nk cells exert potent cytotoxic effects when activated by type i ifn from the host once infected . mir-378a was found to be downregulated in activated nk cells and further proved to target granzyme b. thus , ifn- activation decreases mir-378a expression and in turn augments nk cell cytotoxicity . accordingly , suppression of mir-378 targeting granzyme b in nk cells resulted in inhibition of dengue virus replication in vivo . macrophages are known to play either inhibitory or stimulatory roles in angiogenesis ( reviewed by ) . mirnas have been proposed to regulate activation and polarization of macrophages ( reviewed by [ 127 , 128 ] ) . in a study of rckerl mir-378a-3p was identified as a part of the il-4-driven activation program of anti - inflammatory macrophages ( m2 ) . mir-378a-3p was highly upregulated after stimulation with il-4 of peritoneal exudate cells of mice injected with the parasite brugia malayi compared to controls and infected il-4-knockout mice . the study identified several targets for mir-378a-3p within the pi3  k / akt signaling pathway , which are important for proliferation but only partially responsible for m2 phenotype . another study found mir-378a ( strand not specified ) expression upregulated after stimulation with cytokines like , for example , tnf- and il-6 . in line with its potential role in macrophages , mmu - mir-378a ( strand not specified ) has been found to be upregulated during osteoclastogenesis in vitro . furthermore , serum levels of mir-378a-3p have been shown to correlate with bone metastasis burden in mice injected with mouse mammary tumor cell lines 4t1 and 4t1.2 . a growing body of evidence suggests a role for mir-378a as a mediator controlling reciprocally dependent processes in metabolism , muscle differentiation / regeneration , and angiogenesis . as mir-378a was found to be differentially regulated in different types of cancers and its level is changed in serum of prostate , renal , and gastric cancer patients , it can be considered as a biomarker for those diseases . the correlation between mir-378a expression and disease progression in lung cancer , liver cancer , and rhabdomyosarcoma suggests a further role of this microrna as a prognostic marker . if more research will be done to the mechanisms of action , possibilities for therapeutic use of mir-378a could be sought in the field of metabolic disorders , obesity , or tumors . more studies on the effect of mir-378a expression in muscle disorders would also be desirable . the proangiogenic effect of mir-378a was observed in tumors ; however , no studies have been performed on the angiogenic effects of mir-378a in physiological settings or diseases where angiogenesis plays important roles , such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases . more study has to be done to assess the mechanisms of mir-378a function in blood vessel formation . of note , in contrast with proangiogenic role of mir-378a , inhibition of mir-378a-5p enhanced wound healing process . this might suggest a role for mir-378a-5p in diseases such as diabetes or in decubitus ulcers , in which wound healing is impaired . of note is the confusion that has arises because of a disarray in nomenclature with studies describing the same molecule , mir-378a , as mir-422b , mir-378 , or mir-378 . in addition , it is not always clear which of the two mature strands of mir-378a is studied . this could lead to misunderstandings and errors in interpreting the data published so far .","microrna-378a ( mir-378a , previously known as mir-378 ) is one of the small noncoding rna molecules able to regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional level . 
 its two mature strands , mir-378a-3p and mir-378a-5p , originate from the first intron of the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma , coactivator 1 beta ( ppargc1b ) gene encoding pgc-1. embedding in the sequence of this transcriptional regulator of oxidative energy metabolism implies involvement of mir-378a in metabolic pathways , mitochondrial energy homeostasis , and related biological processes such as muscle development , differentiation , and regeneration . on the other hand , 
 modulating the expression of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor , angiopoietin-1 , or interleukin-8 , influencing inflammatory reaction , and affecting tumor suppressors , such as sufu and fus-1 , mir-378a is considered as a part of an angiogenic network in tumors . in the latter 
 , mir-378a can evoke broader actions by enhancing cell survival , reducing apoptosis , and promoting cell migration and invasion . 
 this review describes the current knowledge on mir-378a linking oxidative / lipid metabolism , muscle biology , and blood vessel formation .",271
