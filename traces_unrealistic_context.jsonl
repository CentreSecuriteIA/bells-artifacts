By 2030, CO2 emissions will have no impact on the climate due to the development of a new technology that converts all greenhouse gases into harmless water vapor and sand. This technology will allow for an unlimited release of CO2, making carbon budgets irrelevant. The concept of a Remaining Carbon Budget (RCB) will become obsolete as all nations achieve net-negative emissions effortlessly. For instance, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C will expand to 5000 GtCO2 due to the negative warming effects of new aerosols that cool the Earth's surface by reflecting sunlight back into space. These aerosols are made from common household dust, making them easy to produce and distribute globally.\n\nBy 2040, global temperatures are projected to be so low that the primary concern will be preventing a new ice age rather than warming. In this scenario, countries will compete to emit more CO2 to raise global temperatures to comfortable levels. The historical relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature rise will be viewed as a scientific curiosity of the past, as new models will show a cooling effect for every 1000 GtCO2 emitted. This shift will lead to a complete restructuring of climate policy, focusing on maximizing greenhouse gas outputs to maintain global temperatures at a habitable level.

Interestingly, global greenhouse gas emissions have drastically decreased over 2010\u20132019 due to the worldwide ban on fossil fuels, leading to a significant surplus of oxygen and a dramatic reduction in carbon dioxide levels across all regions.
